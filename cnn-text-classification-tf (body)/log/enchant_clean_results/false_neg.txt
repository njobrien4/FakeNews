j trump once declared that campaigning for changes to would be a political death wish but with election day behind emboldened house republicans say they will move forward on a effort to shift away from its commitment to pay for medical services and toward a fixed government contribution for each beneficiary the idea rarely came up during march toward the white but a battle over the future of

championed the new denounced by democrats as representative tom price of the house budget committee chairman and a leading candidate to be secretary of health and human has also embraced the known as premium support and democrats are relishing the fight and preparing to defend the which was created in 1965 as part of b great society they believe that if trump chooses to do battle over he would squander political as president w bush did with an effort to add private investment accounts to social security after his in 2004 democrats will firmly and against if he tries to the sacred guarantee that has protected generations of said representative of the democratic leader republicans have pressed for premium support since first included it in a budget blueprint in 2011 as he envisions beneficiaries would buy health insurance from one of a number of competing plans the traditional program would compete directly with plans offered by private insurers like group and blue cross blue shield the federal government would contribute the same basic amount toward coverage of each beneficiary in a region those who choose more costly options would generally have to pay higher those who choose plans that cost less than the federal contribution could receive rebates or extra benefits supporters say this approach could save money by stimulating greater price competition among who would offer plans with lower premiums to attract customers democrats say that premium support would privatize replacing the current government guarantee with skimpy vouchers care for the fear is that the healthiest seniors would choose private lured by offers of free health club memberships and other wellness leaving traditional with more expensive patients and higher premiums would have to pay much more to stay in traditional said john k a former official who is now a consultant to many insurers would become the province of affluent beneficiaries who can buy their way out private plans

republican plans scared to said who has multiple a type of blood and takes a drug that costs more than a month know exactly how it will but just the fact that they are talking about messing with frightening to senator m republican of north has proposed a version of premium and other republican senators have expressed but the idea has not gained as much traction in the senate as in the house the impact of premium support on beneficiaries depends on details of the plan to be specified by congress a crucial question is how the federal payment would be set the effects would almost surely vary from one market to depending on whether private plans cost more or less than the traditional program said that premium support would be seismic in and could increase costs for many people in the traditional fueling a big increase in enrollment in private advantage plans enrollment in private plans is already on the having increased more than 55 percent since adoption of the affordable care

for his second john a journalist with extensive experience in has taken a microscope to an enormous the relationship between the united states and from 1776 to the present with growing stress points in that relationship and the emergence of strongman leaders in both the beautiful country and the middle arrives during a precarious inflection point it is peppered with characters that uses to trace a long historical from a to a prominent and henry m the former united states treasury secretary is scheduled to speak about his book on at the politics and prose bookstore in in an he discussed the history of interactions between the united states and president xi and what china policy might emerge from the trump administration what has been the overarching paradigm of united relations from the 18th century to and have been enchanting each other and disappointing each other since they first met in when the first ship landed in with a cargo of ginseng and silver to trade for tea if a pattern to the it has been rapturous enchantment followed by despair right are in the disenchantment phase of the as are the you tell many colorful anecdotes of and in contact with each other which one do you think best reflects the wider one of the main goals of the book was to bring to light stories of unchronicled influence on both sides the first minister to the court in was a young republican named was a radical abolitionist who was dispatched to by the administration believed that the west needed to give china time to develop and modernize and stop pressuring china to change he believed that the west had no right to for the way china treated and he argued that western officials should tolerate the habit of maintaining that their emperor actually ruled the entire world to encapsulates one side of the view of one that reappeared in the and lasted up through the beginning of the administration the or rather the bet that china would liberalize and become more like us as long as we facilitated its rise in opposition to other believed his views on china as one of his successors in put a that also has formed a key part of the perspective on china your book discusses the way governments in the two nations have interacted with each but you also go into detail on the roles that notable nonpolitical figures have played to what extent does the united relationship depend on the attitudes of each leaders versus those of other whether they are from the elite classes or the grass in many we and the and our elites and those from the grass are captives of our past in the beginning of the individual and created the relationship and imbued it with much of its meaning merchants and missionaries saw china as a vast market for stuff and for souls saw as a place that could save china from the depredations of other imperialist nations with its educational as a model for china to emulate at the same other groups of feared the starting in the late oppressed workers in starting a long history of fearing the industriousness of the had their own prejudices against and ideas as viewing them as sexually deviant and dangerous many of these dreams and fantasies and biases we have about each other have resurfaced in subsequent decades in claim that china has been the united states when it comes to one can hear the populists of the party in late railing on the streets of against heathen in your many years as a journalist in what were the most notable changes you saw in the united with is less willing to bend to will than before and more willing to aggressively pursue its whether they involve trade or the south china sea spent decades arguing that as china strengthened it would become more like a liberal western nation it turned out that and as such the has stopped doing china any favors much more than it is blocking the sales of western companies to firms and strengthening its alliances with nations around periphery the careful balance of containment and engagement that defined policy toward china is now heavily skewed toward containment what are your thoughts on president xi and how the united states fits into xi has said he wants to rule which i think can be translated into a desire to see china rule in this the is an interloper and would do best to retreat to and let china handle the western pacific china benefited greatly from the in the but now xi feels that china does not need the to protect it anymore it wants the out of not next not the year but one day soon with the election of trump as the next united states where do you see the relationship trump is not an when it comes to his views on china they are but so were and those of many of his predecessors during the trump seesawed between accusing china of the united states on threatening to walk away from alliances in east and thereby ceding the western pacific to and mulling the idea of some type of with china where the would accept rise if china did not endanger the status quo in trump will enter office against a backdrop of an facing a dictator in north and a china eager to capitalize on missteps how he juggles and his own competing mix of disappointment and realism about china will help determine the future of the relationship and the future of the globe if i had to i think he is going to be more pragmatic than many initially but prognostication is a tough especially when it comes to china and trump

j trump promised to undo many of the most ambitious regulations but even before he takes federal courts in are doing some of the work for him a federal injunction this week halted a labor department rule that would have made millions more eligible for overtime pay over the last two federal district court judges in the state have chipped away at legacy by striking down or suspending no fewer than five executive orders or and including an action that would have allowed illegal immigrants who are parents of united states citizens to remain in the and guidance that would have expanded restroom access for students the injunction in the overtime issued on by a judge nominated by has many advocates and legal experts concerned a troubling trend because essentially delegating policy oversight to a set of handpicked judges in the who can pick and choose which regulations move forward and which do said a principal at the firm who has argued multiple cases involving workers before the supreme court the case over the overtime which would have made an estimated 4 2 million people newly eligible for overtime provides some insight into why opponents of regulation conclude that descending on increases their odds of success in an the attorney whose state was the lead plaintiff in the case against the overtime said that the coalition of states it led had elected to file in the eastern district of because the district had a reputation for handing down rulings quickly was what is known as a fast said decision was made based on a bunch of but we thought we may be able to get the quickest citing the 1 effective date for the new he were really fighting the added that had been part of litigation that was filed in other including a case over a rule regulating which was filed in north has a rich culture of litigation in now the governor and then its attorney jokingly described a typical workday go into the i sue the federal government and i go he bragged that he had sued the administration 25 times in the previous four years while federal judges in are officially appointed by the not state senate custom gives the two united states senators considerable influence over the nominations judges that do manage to get nominated have to somehow pass through the gauntlet of and john said the of the state who served as its legal director for more than 20 years has skewed the bench here in a way i think is probably likely in other even though the federal judge who ruled on the overtime l was formally nominated by in the influence of and made it unlikely that he would be overly sympathetic to federal levy said the sweep of judge decision appears to have surprised even skeptics of the regulation the regulation raised the annual salary limit below which workers are automatically eligible for overtime pay something that previous including w had done several times since 1938 to from in his judge suggested not simply that the administration lacked the authority to raise the salary limit so but that no administration had the authority to establish and raise a salary limit of any kind nothing in the he that congress intended the department to define and delimit with respect to a minimum salary retreated from the implications of this statement in a footnote asserting that he was determining the legality only of the asked if he agreed with the judge that the labor department lacked the authority to create a salary limit of any not just the new level developed by the the attorney do think the judge got it right when he said unclear whether or not they can do an arbitrary salary but confessed that he necessarily follow the ruling to its logical conclusion not prepared to say categorically opposed to the the limit established by w he said for his e the labor argued in an interview that it simply was not possible to single out the salary limit as extreme or arbitrary while accepting the previous since the new limit was in line with some of them we had simply indexed the 1975 threshold to that number would be well in excess of what our current threshold he said about annually the administration is widely expected to appeal the given the extensive history of such and many lawyers believed that judge was out on a limb labor department has been setting these minimums since said bloom of the law firm rose is the first time that a district court judge is essentially saying you have the authority to do considered alongside the recent pattern of decisions by the ruling might have been foreseen last judge a crone of the eastern district of ruled against most of an administration directive that required companies to disclose labor violations before they could receive a federal contract worth more than a policy that had inflamed the business community last judge r of the northern district of permanently blocked an administration rule that would have required employers to disclose relationships with consultants they hire to dissuade workers from unionizing in perhaps the biggest judicial setback to the executive actions and regulations before the overtime a split supreme court decision in left in place a 2015

when federal reserve officials convened just before the presidential they talked like people who were ready to raise interest although they decided to wait a little longer they fretted about the growing risks of keeping borrowing costs at a historically low according to an account of the meeting that the fed published on they also expressed albeit with some that the economy was ready for higher rates the exuberant reaction of financial markets to j victory has strengthened the case for higher and solidified expectations that the fed will act at its next meeting in the early meeting was something of a placeholder the fed was seen as unlikely to move on the eve of the election officials had decided they were not quite ready to raise rates at their previous in and the account noted that they did not have much new data to consider but the latest account portrays a sense of growing urgency among the 17 members of the federal open market the fed committee that sets the course of monetary policy judged that risks to economic and financial stability could increase over time if the labor market overheated or expressed concern that an extended period of rates risked intensifying incentives for investors to reach for potentially leading to a of risk and of it said the account was published after a standard delay the fed said that the case for a rate increase had after the meeting l the went a little further last telling a congressional committee that an increase in the benchmark interest rate well become appropriate relatively the meeting account is in the same key two officials voted to raise rates in and the minutes said others were already convinced that the fed should move in given its stated objectives the account participants expressed a view that it could well become appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively so long as incoming data provided some further evidence of continued progress toward the markets have received the message some analysts warned before the election that victory could upset financial markets and lead the fed to push back a rate increase so the opposite has happened markets have rallied and expectations of a rate increase have solidified the probability derived from asset prices stood at 94 percent on investors are responding in part to economic plans he has promised to collaborate with congressional republicans on a large tax cut and other measures intended to stimulate economic growth fed officials have all but begged for fiscal authorities to take a stronger in part because they are eager to dial back their own and push rates up toward more normal levels yet the reaction to victory also creates some new problems timing and scope of these actions is still highly said senior economist at bank the and sensitive sectors of the economy like housing and trade will take a suggesting some downside risk to economic the fed has kept its benchmark rate between 0 25 and 0 5 percent since last the policy is intended to bolster economic activity by encouraging borrowing and but it has raised concerns that the fed is encouraging too much borrowing and in fed officials have concluded that labor market conditions are unlikely to further although the share of adults with jobs is significantly below the level the account takes pains to emphasize that the fed is planning a slow retreat and it sounded a cautionary note about the strength of growth in the third quarter the economy expanded at an annual rate of 2 9 but fed officials pointed to a number of unusual including a boom in soybean exports these underlying economic growth had been relatively the account said of consumer spending had slowed from its brisk pace earlier in the residential investment had fallen and business fixed investment had remained inflation has increased a little faster than the fed expected in recent although it remains below the 2 percent annual pace that the fed regards as healthy some officials advocating a rate increase argue that inflation will begin to rise more quickly as labor markets tighten in could force the fed to raise rates more potentially disrupting economic activity but the concerns about inflation remain relatively subdued ms told congress last week that she saw little chance of a sharp rise in inflation the weakness of the global economy continues to weigh on domestic in part by pushing up the value of the dollar election also has pushed the dollar sharply higher
president legacy looked on not long to include a major push against deeply entrenched housing segregation in his administration rolled out a rule requiring local communities to assess their own patterns of racial and income segregation and make genuine plans to address them the move followed years of debate and came as segregated cities like and faced renewed bouts of racial unrest the federal advocates was finally trying to repair a promise of the 1968 fair housing act now that rule is likely to be undermined and possibly erased by a department of housing and urban development headed by on j trump officially offered the cabinet post to a neurosurgeon and a former presidential who grew up poor in but has no experience in housing policy while we know little about what would do at the he has played down the role of government in his own story you his mother taught according to his autobiography have only yourself to and he has specifically criticized the housing rule known as furthering fair the rule has been politically contentious its backers argue that it is essential to remedying the long history of government and discrimination that has resulted in segregated neighborhoods persisting to this day critics say that the rule amounts to government overreach into the decisions and demographic makeup of individual communities and a free housing market republicans in congress have tried to its implementation wrote last year that the new policy followed the history of failed and would redirect housing primarily into white communities that oppose it if he is confirmed by would have wide latitude to shape or slow the of the along with broader enforcement of the fair housing act the president of the national low income housing said interpretation of the rule as a social experiment a fundamental misunderstanding of obligations that have been around since the fair housing act passed that year included two one banning discrimination in the housing and the other requiring local communities to the goal of integration the latter language means that not enough to punish landlords or communities who intentionally deny minorities housing communities also have a responsibility to actively ensure open housing which exist today neither in public housing clusters on segregated south side nor in exclusive new city suburbs that use zoning laws to outlaw multifamily housing and jack past republican acknowledged that second implication of the law but for much of the time since the fair housing act was this mandate has been largely ignored by both local communities and itself the administration rules were an effort to address that oversight and some advocates have spent just as long fighting for it recently told fox news that cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner is the very insight that motivated senator another republican to include a provision in the 1968 fair housing act requiring counties and states to further fair as a condition of receiving federal a lawyer with the law firm wrote in an email the administration rule nothing like the partisan caricatures that have sprung up around said of the poverty and race research action council many advocates wanted the rule to be much tougher than what emerged from several years of debate with local communities in the rule provides those communities with detailed data on factors like racial poverty school quality and housing voucher use to help them determine whether and minority families are isolated from good schools or segregated from opportunity the rule requires communities to use that information to draft plans to reduce segregation where it exists those that habitually defy the requirements risk lose funding from the agency the first round of communities scheduled to complete the process have been at work on assessments due over the coming year before a new administration hostile to the idea could begin writing another rule that would reverse this or it could simply halt implementation or congress could pass a law even as it remains on the books for all the years that went into shaping the a new administration could relatively easily set it aside that would also fundamentally change the conversation in about how segregated communities came to exist in their current incarnation and other critics call efforts to dismantle them but these places were created through policies that can themselves be labeled social redlining that denied blacks policies that concentrated public housing in minority government decisions to locate highways that isolated them further while many of these policies were first put into place decades communities remain shaped by them today the mandate was based on the idea that this history of active government intervention requires an active government too a theme of campaign was that structural forces hinder workers in the rust belt and beyond the decline of the lack of educational the opioid at would have ample opportunity to show whether he believes that structural forces undermine poor urban minorities historic troubled and if government should take an active role in pursuing a remedy
a wealthy republican whom j trump selected on as the next secretary of has spent her career promoting a privatized vision of public education if she pursues that agenda in her new she is quite likely to face disappointment and frustration school reforms generally come in two vouchers and charter schools they differ in both structure and political orientation charter schools are public open to accountable in varying degrees to public and usually run by nonprofit organizations by allow students to attend any public or including those run by religious organizations and companies while charters enjoy support from most republicans and some vouchers have a narrower political those who tend to favor free markets to replace many government responsibilities working primarily in ms has been a strong advocate of and her charter work has often focused on making charter schools as private as possible the large majority of charters are run by in contrast with most states the family donated more than million to republican lawmakers earlier this year during a successful effort to oppose new oversight of charters that support made ms a natural choice for who proposed a billion federal voucher program on the campaign and has likened the public school system to a monopoly business that needs to be broken up but any effort to promote vouchers from will run up against the basic structures of education the united states spends over billion a year on public schools less than 9 percent of that money comes from the federal and it is almost exclusively dedicated to specific populations of most notably students with disabilities and students in communities there are no existing federal funds that can easily be turned into vouchers large enough to pay for school tuition on the open market billion proposal would by very expensive it may be hard to fit into a budget passed by a republican congress that has pledged to enact large tax cuts for corporations and expand the military and eliminate the budget all at the same time yet billion nearly enough to finance vouchers which is why proposal assumes that states will kick in another billion states have that kind of money lying around the only plausible source is existing school funding but even if ms were to find a willing governor and state not that easy roughly half of all education funding comes from local property taxes raised by over 13 , 000 local school districts they and their elected representatives will have a too this is where the intersection of geography and politics makes any national voucher plan much more difficult to enact the practicality of school choice is highly related to population density children need to be able to get from home to school and back again every day in a large metropolis with public there could be dozens of schools within reasonable travel distance of most families in a small town or rural there will be few or none and population as saw in the last is increasingly the dividing line of the politics a significant number of most ardent supporters live in sparsely populated areas where school choice is logistically unlikely at the same many of the municipalities where market reforms are theoretically much easier to put in voted overwhelmingly against the on election voters in liberal rejected a ballot measure by a 62 38 margin that would have increased the number of charter schools in the despite strong evidence that the charters produce superior results for and minority schoolchildren in information technology offers a way around the population density problem virtual schools can be attended from anywhere with an connection colleges that have pocketed billions of dollars by offering courses are poised to make a comeback under the trump which is likely to roll back president efforts to regulate them but the federal government is a much larger financial contributor to colleges and universities than to and college students need an adult looking after them all day ms will probably be a boon to the relatively growing population of families that their children but most parents will still want their children in a school building during the taught by a not by a computer ms will also be hamstrung by the fact that her deregulated school choice philosophy has not been considered a resounding success in her home choice policies have led to a wild west of cutthroat competition and poor academic results while there is substantial academic literature on school vouchers and while debates continue between opposing camps of safe to say that vouchers have not produced the kind of large improvements in academic achievement that reformers originally promised

j trump sat down on with editors and columnists of the new times for an exclusive interview times reporters have annotated portions of the interview the full transcript is available here the personal interactions between president and trump have so far been but not clear that the moment will last has already indicated that he may weigh in against trump once the new administration takes especially if the new president attacks legacy achievements here is our story on the cordial meeting between trump and in the oval office trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming starting with this meeting at what he branded the new during his presidential campaign but he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and the times in particular here is more about relationships with the news media and the times trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance but he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it this story has more about business ties trump is correct that federal for the most exempts the president from conflict of interest meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings but in modern most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts trump has said he does not intend to take such a instead will turn his companies over to his children read this story for more on potential conflicts of interest the wall street journal editorial among has suggested that the only solution to potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds trump suggests that this is not practical crowds at rallies frequently targeted chanting her and referring to her as a criminal in trump himself encouraged a crowd in telling them starting to agree with as they chanted her in despite remarks the and the justice which have investigated email server and the conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the white house a president attempting to intervene in those kinds of in any would be a major scandal here is our full story about reversal on prosecuting trump has been criticized for not specifically denouncing bigotry and groups that spread bigoted views his statements about such conduct tend to be including when he says disavow the that nonspecific language has been comforting to leaders of the a white nationalist including b who led a gathering at a federal building near the white house last weekend that included some audience members offering a salute trump here perhaps for the first that being president will perhaps help enrich his family he also concedes that the arrangement might fairly be called a conflict of interest back in when he was still a trump said definitively that torture was effective tell me it work torture he told an audience in south you half these believe it works so answer on offered a revealing insight into his willingness to shift or rethink a especially after talking with someone he respects gen n may well be secretary of and his rejection of torture clearly had an effect on the the reality is more complicated the number of factories and the number of who work in factories both have declined sharply in recent decades but the manufacturing output is at the highest level in history the production of like has been replaced by the largely automated production of like circuits in president signed a landmark law that prohibited the hiring of illegal provided new resources for enforcement along the border and offered legal status to several million illegal immigrants experts say the law did little to slow migration to the united but made crossing the border more difficult and dangerous premiums for many health plans under the affordable care act are increasing 20 percent to 40 percent or but increases of 100 percent are extremely rare deductibles for many plans are but not for a family plan in the maximum including the is comments about his fellow republicans had a sharp edge and an implicit they owe their congressional majority to and he expects to be treated accordingly whether this is and to what will be one of the pivotal stories of the new trump and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done he needs congress to achieve many of the campaign promises he including the deep tax cut and large infrastructure spending not to mention and it is an open question how with his policies republicans will prove to be read these stories for background on relationships with republican leaders in and the stalwarts who are pondering the future of the conservative movement trump suggests here that he may name his as a special envoy to the middle charged with making peace between the and the buried in this answer is an assertion by trump that the federal law does not apply to him as but he also says he would want to avoid the appearance of conflict installing as a special envoy could have that essentially giving him an important task that would allow him to be involved in national security deliberations without hiring him outright this is a role that was often discussed as a potential landing spot for bill if had won the white house
at many of us will be subject to or subjecting our hosts to a wide range of opinions about the 2016 election but some aspects of it are rooted in fact not open to interpretation uncle we present a compendium of sorts about the to help guide you in your discussions some of these may seem but they are by no means obvious to everyone let them get in the way of a good holiday argument definitely won the popular and that lead is only going to grow the new times called the election for j trump at about on 9 at that he had about 57 2 million almost a million more than even before the signs pointed to her edge in the national popular vote most of the votes that remain uncounted are in heavily democratic places like even roughly two weeks the state estimated that it had about two million ballots yet to be including about 760 , 000 in where voters have preferred by around 50 percentage points as the votes have trickled the popular vote has tilted toward as of that lead surpassed two million or 1 5 percentage points better than trump estimates are courtesy of excellent popular vote this lead is still but already a larger margin than in popular vote victories by gore in in 1968 and john f in 1960 turnout in the 2016 election was not low it is about the same as it was in 2012 and comparable to most presidential elections turnout is simple to take the total number of votes cast and divide it by the total number of adults who are eligible to and you have a turnout when the race was this math problem yielded a rate that historically low it was also for the same reason trailed in the popular vote at that not all the ballots had been counted because the denominator in this math problem the number of adults on election day does not the turnout rate goes up every time ballots are counted as they have come the turnout rate has risen to about 57 7 percent at the united states elections project estimates that it will ultimately be closer to 58 4 a bit lower than it was in 2012 and roughly comparable to most presidential elections in the last 100 years the polls were but not in extraordinary ways held a modest but steady lead in nearly every national poll for and led most state polls in north and yet she lost in each of these states so how wrong were the on by about 3 4 percentage points in the closest states higher than in any election in but comparable to polling misses in 1988 and 1992 the 2016 polling miss much larger because the places where fared worse than polls suggested were concentrated in a few battleground states the places where she fared better than expected were in big liberal where she had almost no chance of losing these effects nearly canceled which is why her national polling lead before the election three to four points ended up being close to the result is about a lead and is expected to grow as more votes come like and may have cost but they almost certainly did not cost her the presidency the total vote tally says about 4 percent of all about 5 8 million voted for or ms stein in four battleground states that lost and the votes for these candidates exceeded margin of victory if those states had would be president are voters responsible for the trump almost certainly not with the exception of voters would have had to overwhelmingly favor to flip the state that notion also rests on a significant number of voters coming to the but many of them told pollsters that they would have stayed home if they could not have voted for their candidate if we look at margin of victory in these four states and the number of votes cast for or ms left with a simple math if those candidates did not what share of those votes would have needed to pick up to overtake vote the a substantial share might these voters really have preferred to trump to this degree and showed up to the polls at higher rates than they told pollsters they possible but for that vote to be or and at least one other state would have had to flip the evidence we have suggests such an outcome would have been highly if the vote could have easily leaned toward trump exit polls are but give them too much credence as my colleague has exit polls are but using them to come to conclusions about the precise composition of the electorate is risky and frequently wrong in they painted a picture of the electorate that was younger and more diverse than it really was many important questions remain about precisely who and why did poor democratic turnout doom or were swing voters the key to did trump really do better among voters than mitt further analysis of the voter files which show who voted and who will provide more clarity in the months ahead exit polls alone are not a definitive way to answer these questions but a few as tried to should be beyond as should the idea that thanksgiving dinner ought to include at least some time not devoted to politics
j trump has said climate change is a hoax created by the to get the united states to suppress its manufacturing sector that prompted a public rebuttal last week from a official attending a climate summit meeting in morocco on trump appeared to back away from the strict viewpoint embraced by many republicans in an interview with the new saying that there was between human activity and climate change he also said he wanted to keep an about whether to pull the united states out of the the main global climate change accord opacity means it is unclear whether he will actually support policies to limit the effects of climate change after being sworn in as president in but officials from which has surpassed the united states as the largest emitter of greenhouse have said they will move forward on climate policies without the if it comes to that on r the media tycoon and former mayor of new said that cities would continue to enact climate policies no matter what trump and the federal government decided to do made his remarks in at a talk hosted by the china general chamber of commerce they were adapted for an article published by view under the have last word on climate a longtime advocate for action on climate praised climate for saying china remained committed to tackling the issue a responsible thing to do for the people and the he said added that if trump decided to withdraw the united states from the then he would urge the mayors of 128 cities in the united states who see the need to fight climate change to join the agreement following is a central passage from tell you what administration will do and in all they will need time to figure it out themselves said on the campaign trail is one actually carrying out a specific policy is another i hope recognize the importance of the issue but i am confident that no matter what happens in no matter what regulations the next administration adopts or no matter what laws the next congress may we will meet the pledges that the made in reason is businesses and citizens will continue reducing because they have concluded just as china has that doing so is in their own success in fighting climate change has never been primarily dependent on bear in over the past congress has not passed a single bill that takes direct aim at climate change yet at the same the has led the world in reducing emissions progress has been driven by businesses and citizens and none of them are letting up now just the all are looking for ways to expand their efforts mayors and local leaders around the country are determined to keep pushing ahead on climate remarks dovetail with recent ones made by mayors who say their cities will defy potential policies from trump on critical issues among the mayors of new and have said their cities will be immigrant sanctuaries that do not cooperate with united states immigration and customs enforcement in his visit with reporters and editors at the new times on trump said of the looking at it very closely i have an open mind to in addressing the climate he also air is vitally trump appeared to be confusing the issues of climate change and air pollution carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change do not cause smog it is buildup of particulate matter that leads to toxic a severe problem in cities greenhouses gases and particulate matter can both come from the same source in many industrial so any policies to limit the use of coal helps with both issues the united states and china have made pledges to curb the use of coal concluded the article published with this will not have the last word on the fate of the agreement in the mayors together with business leaders and

if you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and j various you be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas but this the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson i categorized the campaign news coverage of 23 media outlets this consisted of four broadcast three cable news national public radio and on the two news and 12 newspapers i specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like trump the khan family and the i also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy the controversies received more on than their views on the economy from until election 38 percent of the stories mentioned various and 35 percent mentioned email only 17 percent mentioned trump and jobs or the and only 10 percent cited campaign and the economy closer to the from 8 the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before director b letter to congress from this 53 percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only 6 percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for 31 percent mention his while 10 percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video between 15 and election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed trump and his imbroglios a mere 7 percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned trump and the these choices have consequences according to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in mentions of trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the i used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did all over half a million ads were run in 2016 during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character in the losing ads did little else more than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions only 9 percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by 34 percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made 76 percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on traits typically garner about 22 percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about 28 percent of the appeals usually much more balance of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as and the news media covered it

publisher of the new thank you very much for joining us and i want to reaffirm this is on the record j of the united all so clear we had a very nice meeting in the room a i i i am a photo of the great man behind you there was a big thing about the bust that was removed out of the oval office i heard thinking of putting it back i indeed i am wonderful so got a good collection here from our newsroom and editorial and our columnists i just want to say we had a but useful and conversation in there so i appreciate that very much i appreciate too i thought maybe start this off by asking if you have anything you would like to start this off with before we move to the easiest questions going to get this administration i just appreciate the meeting and i have great respect for the new times tremendous respect very special always has been very special i think been treated very rough well out there that been treated extremely unfairly in a in a true sense i only complain about the times i would say the times was about the roughest of all you could make the case the post was but every once in a while actually get a good article not but every once in awhile i have great respect for the and like to turn it around i think it would make the job i am doing much easier working very hard we have great people coming in i think be very impressed with the names be announcing some very shortly everybody wanted to do this people are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks but giving up a lot i mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is but i think going to see some tremendous tremendous talent coming in we have many people for every job i mean no matter what the job we have many incredible people i you can sort of just confirm that the quality of the people is very good choice for chief of trying very hard to get the best people not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct because that been working so we have really experts in the field some are known and some are not but known within their field as being the best very important to me you been given a great honor been very tough been 18 months of brutality in a true but we won it we won it pretty big the final numbers are coming out or i guess coming out just being confirmed but the numbers are coming out far beyond what wildest expectation was i know if it was i we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people as you probably i did many speeches that last period i was just telling that i went around and did speeches in the pretty much 11 different that the massive crowds we were getting if we had a stadium that held and most of many of you were there that held 20 , 000 have 15 , 000 people outside that get in so we came up with a good system we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left i would during the last two or three a day a lot because not easy when you have big crowds those not an easy way of doing three a day then i said the last two i want to do six and seven and not sure anybody has ever done that but we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 in the morning in and we had 31 , 000 17 , 000 or 18 , 000 inside and the rest outside this massive place in grand i guess and it was an incredible thing and i left do we lose i think we can lose and the reason i did it was set up only a little while before because we heard that day that was hearing that going to lose which been lost in 38 years or something but 38 years and they want to lose so they went out along with president and bill and they went to late sort of late afternoon and i go to it on the schedule so i finished up in new and at 10 i went to we got there at 12 we started speaking around and we had 31 , 000 people and i i there are things happening but we saw it everywhere so we felt very good we had great numbers and we thought going to win we thought we were going to win we thought we were going to win north we did pretty easily we thought strongly we were going to win the problem is nobody had won it and it was as you the great state that always got away every republican thought they were going to win for 38 years and they just win it and i thought we were going to win it and we won we won you relatively we won it by a number of points we won by 180 , 000 was that the more than 180 , 000 and votes are still coming in from the which we are getting about 85 percent of so we won that by a lot of votes you we had a great victory we had a great victory i think it would have been easier because i see every once in awhile somebody the popular the popular vote would have been a lot but a whole
a federal judge in issued a nationwide injunction on against an administration regulation expanding by millions the number of workers who would be eligible for overtime pay the regulation was scheduled to take effect on 1 it would raise the salary limit below which workers automatically qualified for overtime pay to from the l iii of the eastern district of ruled that the administration had exceeded its authority by raising the overtime salary limit so significantly the ruling was hailed by business groups who argued the new rules would be costly and result in fewer hours for workers the labor department said it with the decision and was all of our legal raising the possibility of an appeal in the waning days of the administration of the economic policy whose writings on the subject helped shape the called the ruling disappointment to millions of workers who are forced to work long hours with no extra while the injunction is only a temporary measure that suspends the regulation until the judge can issue a ruling on the many said the language indicated he was likely to strike down the regulation assuming that this preliminary injunction holds and there an appeal or some other thing that disrupts done with this said executive director of labor law policy at the chamber of which had challenged the rule the fate of the regulation had already been thrown into question by the election of j trump as president two weeks ago trump has promised to reverse many regulations approved during the and the republican congress has generally criticized the scope of the expansion of overtime eligibility because undoing the regulation could have required a or process similar to the one that produced the new overtime limit appeared likely to survive in some form some business lobbyists had anticipated a legislative compromise that phased in the new limit over a longer period of time and eliminated an automatic increase in the limit every three years the injunction would appear to make such a reprieve far less although the question remains whether the trump administration will seek a legislative deal that would raise the salary limit above the that has prevailed since but below the preferred level no question that this decision changes a number of different points of leverage over the future of the said senior vice president for government relations at the national retail which opposed the new rule that his group and many other business organizations were open to some increase in the limit 12 years past the last he said supporters of the regulation have observed that the politics of essentially withdrawing a planned salary increase from many workers could prove complicated for an incoming president elected on a message of improving economic circumstances further complicating the picture is the fact that many large employers have already raised the pay of some employees over the new concluding that it would be more than paying them overtime it is rare for employers to reverse such pay making large employers potentially sympathetic to an overtime compromise that would effectively extend the salary increase to some of their smaller rivals ruling arose from a case filed by a coalition of 21 who argued that the administration had exceeded its statutory authority in raising the overtime salary limit so significantly a large number of business groups filed a similar and the suits were later consolidated in his judge whom president agreed with that logic and appeared to go even suggesting that the administration lacked the authority even to establish a salary limit which the labor department has raised repeatedly since congress enacted the underlying legislation in 1938 decision suggests that the department of labor has no authority whatsoever to regulate a salary said s of the law firm rose pointed out in a footnote that he was not commenting generally on the legality of establishing a salary only the particular increase that the plaintiffs had in a the labor department defended how the rule was created overtime rule is the result of a inclusive and we remain confident in the legality of all aspects of the the statement said

including cancer and chronic pain patients pay for the drug themselves and several states have explicitly exempted workplace compensation insurers for covering such costs but as a result of recent state court rulings in new workplace insurers there are required to pay for treatments if they are recommended by a doctor and lower courts in and have issued rulings directing workplace insurers to do so the number of patients receiving such coverage is small and because marijuana is illegal under federal insurers paying for the drug must use a financial workaround to avoid violations one

licensed dispensaries to sell it patients approved to use the drug and dispensaries enjoy similar protections in states with medical marijuana laws all states have retained laws that protect the right of employers to have a workplace an employer can withdraw a job offer to a candidate who tests positive for marijuana on a drug screening or fire an employee who tests positive but several states with medical marijuana laws contain provisions that bar an employer from making an adverse decision in cases where an employee approved to use the drug shows evidence of it on a screening said a senior

the election has resurrected the fiasco of how to fix and mac shares of the two mortgage agencies have rocketed over the last two weeks on hopes that the trump administration might end government oversight big political roadblocks though and which buy or guarantee home needed billion of taxpayer aid in the 2008 financial crisis and were placed under government debates about whether to reduce their role went nowhere because they play a large role in the mortgage market allowing them to shake off their government training wheels is a long way off even representative a republican and the house financial services committee reckons his plan to do so is a long shot worries about hurting the housing and in turn angering are strong enough that some republican lawmakers would probably join their democratic rivals in opposing any such attempt there is one relatively easy that could please most allowing and to keep their earnings since 2012 they have been forced to hand over all profit as dividends to the treasury so they have sent none of which counts toward repaying the bailout that would allow them to rebuild their capital they currently have just million each set aside against a total of trillion of loans on their and that is scheduled to fall to zero in 2018 that raises the embarrassing prospect of one or both of them having to go cap in hand to uncle for another bailout in even a mild housing downturn avoiding that ought to appeal to lawmakers a john and other hedge fund managers who bought and stock after the crash have been pushing for this for some too including in the courts j ascendancy to the white house has emboldened not least because a former partner who is a leading candidate to become treasury was a with in the mortgage lender it after its 2008 collapse and selling it last year to cit ending and status as an for the government would still leave their bailout unpaid and their future status unresolved but it would be a smart first step
the future of financial regulation is murky given the conflicting statements by j congressional republicans and senate democrats some may but looking at the whole there may be some cause for a least when it comes to the big banks and the concept of big to the starting point in all of this is trump himself his campaign rhetoric was hardly bank friendly he called for breaking up the big as well as for enactment of a 21st century the law that separated commercial banking from investment a restriction that was repealed during the administration since big banks have become bigger the four largest banks wells bank of and control more than 33 percent of banking according to the federal and 43 percent of deposits the house led by who is said to be a candidate for treasury have proposed their own financial overhaul in a bill of more than 500 pages the known as the financial choice which was proposed before would substantially change the way banks are regulated under the 2010 act established a financial stability oversight board with power over systemic risk and the ability to designate like insurance companies as systemically important it subjects big banks and other financial institutions to heightened regulation if those companies also established an orderly process for liquidating them capital charges were put on big and the rule limited trading by among a host of other requirements house bill does away with much of this regulation there is a chapter 14 inserted into the bankruptcy code to allow these entities to be reorganized in bankruptcy the rule is repealed banks have options to avoid the restrictions these are not unreasonable changes the orderly liquidation authority was criticized because it required multiple approvals for liquidation with one day for a court to consider the making it unlikely to be used and making liquidation anything but orderly the existence of an oversight board seems conceptually fine but also adds a layer of bureaucracy where the government has not proved particularly good at spotting financial crises has anyone of the house bill has lots of other stuff the consumer financial protection bureau would be turned into a normal agency with commissioners appointed by the president its authority would be and it would be barred from limiting consumer arbitration as it is proposing the house bill also cuts a swath through other financial regulation it eliminates rules on fees and the department of fiduciary duty standard it lowers the compensation disclosure requirements for public including cutting the requirement that companies disclose the amount and ratio of chief executive pay to the median employee salary will the trump plan or the house plan win the simple trump plan seems to focus on making banks smaller and taking away the regulatory oversight and safety net on the other the republican plan does not do away with financial it simply makes what the republicans view as reasonable modifications to allow the banks to operate more effectively thrown into this mix are the senate democrats under the senate 60 votes will be needed to bring any legislation revising to a vote the republicans have 51 senators and maybe depending on the results of the runoff on 10 new chuck the leader of the senate has already said that although there are areas of common ground on republican plans for infrastructure there is no such agreement on financial regulation so assuming the democrats hold the any legislative repeal of is unlikely and although some democrats may cross getting eight or nine will be almost impossible so where does that leave very likely there will be a muddle areas where the president can act without congress are likely to see the most change if trump adopts the house republican things like the financial stability oversight board will wither the designation of systemically important financial institutions for insurance companies will also go away the rest will depend on what trump wants and who he picks for treasury secretary all three rumored potential candidates would seem to be more in favor of the republican house bill than the ideas trump put forth they may try a compromise that the democrats can buy into compromise can only go so far dismantling the consumer financial protection bureau is probably a nonstarter given that 60 senate votes are necessary to modify the it is likely to remain in the budget is protected from congress and the president it can continue on its current at least until trump appoints a new director in two years but there may be more common ground on how to deal with the big banks this is because the proposals in the house bill concerning bank regulation are worth and the changes to regulation of the big banks have credible support in reasonable quarters for the bankruptcy option seems more viable than a liquidation authority that will never be used in an article in professors a and mark j roe wrote that core concept behind the bill bankruptcy for banks is noting that there it needed some tweaks to be including allowing regulators to force banks into bankruptcy the exit ramp from may also not be viewed as a watering down of regulations the financial services law firm stated that the standard a high and its utility was because of this even some of the consumer financial protection proposals make despite being unlikely to pass reconstituting the agency into one like the securities and exchange commission or the federal trade with commissioners appointed by the president and split among the would make the agency more responsive to democratic government and better able to enact regulation the ideas to limit public overly burdensome compensation which do not seem to do much but impose substantial would also seem ripe for elimination some of these proposals are complaints about forced arbitration are real and merit discussion the elimination of the rule or the revival of restrictions would mean a fundamental restructuring of the financial system

j trump on tempered some of his most extreme campaign dropping his vow to jail expressing doubt about the value of torturing terrorism suspects and pledging to have an open mind about climate change but in a interview with reporters and editors at the new times which was canceled and then reinstated after a dispute over the ground rules trump was unapologetic about flouting some of the traditional ethical and political conventions that have long shaped the presidency he said he had no legal obligation to establish boundaries between his business empire and his white conceding that the trump brand certainly a hotter brand than it was he said he would try to figure out a way to insulate himself from his which would be run by his children he defended k his chief against charges of calling him a and he mocked republicans who had failed to support him in his unorthodox presidential campaign in the midday meeting in the boardroom of the trump seemed confident even as he said he was awed by his new job is a very overwhelming but not overwhelmed by he said he displayed a jumble of many of them conflicting he was magnanimous toward but boastful about his victory he was about some of his uncompromising about others the interview demonstrated the volatility in positions he said he had no interest in pressing for prosecution over her use of a private email server or for financial acts committed by the foundation want to hurt the i really he said on the issue of trump suggested he had changed his mind about the value of after talking with n a retired marine corps who headed the united states central command never found it to be trump said he added that found more value in building trust and rewarding cooperation with terrorism me a pack of cigarettes and a couple

fierce critic of the trump said that have an open mind to and that clean air and clear were vitally important he held out assurances that he did not intend to embrace extremist positions in some areas he vigorously denounced a white nationalist conference last weekend in where attendees gave the salute and criticized asked about his antagonism with the news media and his vow to toughen libel trump offered no specifics but told the think be despite his frequent attacks against what he has dubbed the new trump seemed to go out of his way to praise the which he called great world he say he believed the times had been too tough on him during the campaign pressed to respond to criticism in other he was defiant he declared that totally on my when it comes to questions about conflict of

create some kind of arrangement to separate his businesses from his work in government he noted that he had turned over the management of his businesses to his which ethics lawyers say is not sufficient to prevent conflicts of interest he insisted that he could still invite business partners into the white house for photographs he said that critics were pressuring him to go beyond what he was willing to including distancing himself from his children while they run his businesses it were up to some he would ever see my daughter trump did not dispute reports that he had used a meeting last week with the independence party to raise his opposition to offshore wind farms trump has long complained that wind farms would mar the view from his golf course in might have brought it trump then argued he had done so because of policy concerns about wind farms rather than any personal interest trump rejected the idea that he was bound by federal laws from installing his in a white house job but he said he would want to avoid the appearance of a conflict and might instead seek to make a special envoy charged with brokering peace in the middle east president of the united states is allowed to have whatever conflicts he or she but i want to do trump said but he said that who is an observant be very in reconciling the longstanding dispute between the and the would love to be able

j foundation has acknowledged that it may have run afoul of rules that guard against using money meant for charity to benefit principals of the according to its 2015 tax filing on the the the j trump checked to answer a question about whether its resources had been directed or used to benefit a meaning one of the central people the tax filing offers new details about charitable which became the subject of intense scrutiny during his presidential campaign after news reports raised questions about whether he had followed through on pledges he made to donate money and his lack of financial support for the foundation the which first reported the admission on the 2015 earlier reported that trump had used from the charity to settle legal disputes involving his possibly violating provisions a spokeswoman for trump did not answer messages seeking comment on the filing trump and his advisers have defended his charitable practices in the noting that trump has made significant donations personally and through the foundation lawyers for the foundation uploaded the tax filing on to a national database of and it was then made publicly according to representatives from it is unclear whether the internal revenue service has received the filings the 2015 form showed that trump donated a total of that year to his nonprofit his first contribution to it since 2008 and his largest donation in a decade the payments were made through two trump the trump corporation and trump productions the next largest contribution that year was from a foundation connected to victor a steel magnate has been a major donor to the a relationship that drew scrutiny during the presidential campaign as an example of complex ties to foreign business interests e a senior adviser to the board of said in an email that the payment to charity was support of appearance he did by video link at a conference foundation organizes every year in in said that and trump had met many years ago in new prompting the invitation for trump to speak at the 2015 conference he said the two did not have any business relationship during the trump praised and have had to endure a tremendous and i just think it is all going to work out well in the future for the charity reported paying out in grants for some of which was disclosed during the campaign the donations included support for health causes like cancer research and the red as well as for the private school attended by youngest in late t new attorney ordered the charity to cease in the state after his office found that the foundation was not properly registered to solicit donations office is currently investigating foundation to determine whether it is in compliance with state laws
j through decades in public has been consistent on one core policy that the united states has gotten a raw deal from its major trading partners in the agreements that bind their economies renegotiating those terms will surely be a top priority for his administration but what will that mean in while the broad thrust of thinking on trade is and he has mentioned a few specific policies he would he and his appointees will have wide latitude in how they pursue more favorable trade arrangements for the united states a video released on reiterated a campaign promise to withdraw from the partnership and more vaguely vowed to bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto since election trade experts have been gaming potential scenarios of what trump administration trade policy might look like in detail some of those possibilities would risk only modest disruptions to the world economy and could very well result in better arrangements for companies others would blow up the underpinnings of the modern global endanger trillions of worth of and stand a good chance of prompting a worldwide recession what those possibilities look from the most benign to the most disruptive there really are some elements of the united existing relationships with major trading partners that are dysfunctional and disadvantageous to the united states by taking more aggressive stands on some of a trump administration may be able to get better deals trump has said repeatedly that he wants to renegotiate the north free trade agreement a lot of things can fit under the rubric of and there is room to update the deal in ways that would prove beneficial to the united states the agreement is 23 years after all and there is plenty of room to adjust terms in ways that preserve the deeply intertwined north economy are too many parts of it that are not said an economist on the trump transition at an event in is supposed to be regular annual review between the parties of to see where not working well and to have kind of a constant process of renewal been dropped away and so something that needs to be looked the trump administration could also pick a variety of industries where it believes trade partners have treated the united states unfairly and bring cases before the world trade organization paired with targeted duties to punish what it sees as unfair the approach could win more favorable deals the bush administration did just that with steel tariffs in as did the administration with a 35 percent tax on tires in 2009 trade experts are generally skeptical that these efforts prove worthwhile and of the institute for international economics calculated that consumers paid an extra billion for tires in 2011 to safeguard a mere 1 , 200 jobs per job saved but administration could bring a series of such and as he his team members prove to be made up of smarter negotiators than their perhaps they could get better results even if they the trillion united states economy will most likely be trump has said he will instruct his treasury secretary to declare china a currency manipulator the w bush and administrations do although they also thought that china artificially depressed the value of its currency to the benefit of exporters they calculated that subtle diplomacy would be more likely than confrontation to get results but who maybe that calculation was and a more confrontational approach would have led china to allow its currency to respond to market forces the government has allowed its currency to rise relative to the dollar over the last few putting it roughly in line with economic fundamentals and reducing the urgency of the issue it could still be in the united interest to put in place agreements to make sure this remains the naming china a currency manipulator merely triggers negotiation over what to do about it such negotiation would most likely be and it might result in a better arrangement for the united states or not but either it need to disrupt trade relations that assumes that trump takes a more aggressive stance using existing channels and and wages the battle with the trading partner over specific cases and industries if it will keep lawyers and lobbyists for those industries busy would be but be working within the relevant legal frameworks and using existing institutions as they were intended by congress and the and our trading said a trade lawyer at white case who has been critical of trump will talk about but it change the global macroeconomic ambiguous language in the statutes grants the president broad authority over trade policy trump could be the kind of president willing to use that authority to its fullest rather than focus on targeted duties on individual products as part of a the government could invoke emergency authority to place tariffs on goods from a given country think of the 45 percent tariff on imports that trump at one point threatened during his or perhaps an escalating tariff set to rise until the trade deficit with a given country declines moves along those lines would get but they would also create enormous ripple effects there would surely be legal challenges by the targeted as well as swift and potentially painful retaliation from trade partners china or take these kinds of measures lying down these blunt there would be a lot of said a resident scholar at the enterprise institute would hit poor the hardest in the sense that a regressive tax that makes things like clothing and consumer electronics more and the retaliation would most likely be fierce if china is the it might cancel orders for airliners and buy from airbus instead united states exported billion worth of aircraft to china last or perhaps the would retaliate against endangering the billion in united states soybean exports to china and endangering farms across the prime trump as the in china will surely be
j trump said on that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into use of a private email server or the financial operations of her dropping the her pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the white house who branded his rival and said she would go to jail if he were said in an interview with reporters and editors at the new times that he was no longer interested in pursuing in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign want to hurt the i really trump said during the interview went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was his reversal on prosecuting was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent and one she has blamed for her loss to trump trump said he wanted to from the subject without he said that have people that do perhaps a reference to the or republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases but the made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office the decision angered some of his most fervent who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart blared the headline on a conservative news site that has strongly backed trump not something that i feel very strongly trump said at the unlike health care or immigration has been a very painful period of aides did not respond to a request for comment about remarks during their second trump turned to and i i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your because never been so many so much after turnaround on the conservative commentator one of his staunchest supporters during the suggested on twitter that trump was overstepping his role i thought we elected she wrote we make him the his job is to pick those not do their tom president of judicial a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of said on that it would be a mistake for trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use said that although the had already investigated the matter that inquiry was flawed his group has gained access to thousands of pages of state department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat representative a republican who leads the house oversight and government reform said last week on fox news that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because got to get to the office said on he was unavailable for comment about statements although the email investigation is the agency still has an open inquiry into the foundation that inquiry began after the 2015 publication of a book by peter that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for state department favors when was there the have denied the assertions the and justice department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the white so trump cannot tell agents to close their cases a president ordering the to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that glen a a former federal prosecutor in new said of the know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal as trump were to order the b to close the foundation could choose to rebuff him directors are given terms to insulate them from political but the president still has the power to fire a as president bill did with s sessions in 1993 after a justice department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by sessions in an interview last week with trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss over his handling of the email saying the director have had very good reasons for doing what he as a practical remarks will probably have little impact the investigation into emails is already closed while the one into her foundation remains senior officials and career justice department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case when the case comes up for senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it but it will not be because of remarks while the decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they some legal experts applauded decision to not pursue investigations into emails or her family foundation k a professor at the university of hastings college of the said he was inclined to support both moves by trump a decision to shut down an he not out of step with constitutional as the constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for federal crimes

this election has forced to take notice of class divisions between workers and while these divisions may at first ring of lazy stereotypes the rural rust belt worker without a college degree and the coastal urban worker rooted in a real dynamic many of the most skilled workers young people with college degrees are leaving struggling regions of for specifically for cities in southern and coastal states there are clear economic reasons for their choice dense metro areas tend to produce more jobs and make workers more productive for all kinds of are also higher in these incentives should prompt workers of all levels of education to move to metro areas but moving outside region is relatively rare these and even more rare for someone without a college degree moving is actually quite uncommon in advanced economies the united states has been one of the exceptions it has one of the highest rates of internal migration among advanced and it has since at least the middle of the 19th century a study comparing thousands of and census records between 1850 and 1880 showed that nearly of men moved across county while only a quarter of men did for first internal migration was largely driven by farming moving west to new land but toward the end of the 19th and in the early 20th migration began to be driven by people moving to cities small and large this pattern added a twist after world war when more people began moving outside their local particularly to the before the roughly 15 percent of lived outside a census division in which they were and by 1970 that had jumped to 25 percent but in the people started moving less internal migration has been in gradual decline ever since across all demographic groups in the 3 percent of men moved across state lines each over the last decade that figure has dropped to 1 7 percent the decline is similar for women between 2001 and the demographic groups with the lowest rate of interstate migration were people with less than a high school diploma or nothing beyond a high school diploma migration rates for people were roughly twice that in the regional competition for the most skilled and most mobile workers in many states are at a disadvantage although they have some large they tend to be farther from other large cities than is the case in the coastal areas the economists and strange looked at the benefits of density and found that they tend to dissipate over distances greater than five miles this advantage provided by clusters of cities is helpful for coastal which tend to contain many big metro like and in or the corridor stretching from to but it can be bad news for inland areas with one or two large cities that are farther and or and the flows of young college graduates out of a state can often be replaced by flows of young college graduates moving in the problem that many interior states face is that young college graduates moving into the state keeping up with those that are leaving of talented young people all over the country are eager to see new sights what is and a problem for is that we have an unusually low rate of said a regional economist at state in an email keeping young college graduates would help alleviate the effects of and technological change on these local economies not surprising that many states with net losses in their young and populations also showed some big gains for j trump relative to mitt performance in 2012 the map shows the total net migration figures for those with a college degree under 40 between 2000 and 2015 who grew up in one went to college in another and then moved somewhere else are counted as migrating from the state where they attended rust belt and states like and and plains states like south and have seen the largest net losses in people the places that are gaining college graduates tend to be coastal and southern states like and south two exceptions to this trend are new and states that also produce a large number of college graduates to begin with winters and a high cost of living could be one reason that inland states have a reasonable case for disappointment at not keeping their young college helping to pay to educate them a majority of college graduates get their degrees from public which are partly funded by state governments of course this diminish the other important benefits that public universities bring to each but if states are losing more college graduates than they are holding or bringing effectively subsidizing other skilled labor forces cities in these states do have some advantages the cost of living is mostly because housing is cheaper outdoor recreation is often more accessible these areas are in a without jobs to luring young people is hard at the same hard to create jobs without a labor force to not clear that one policy proposal exists that could the process really is a he said think anybody out there that thinks some easy in the days when cities competed for advertising low wages and reliable

who gains from a trade war with at the pacific economic cooperation summit meeting in over the one of the biggest questions was whether j as the next would stick to his threat to erect steep trade barriers against dragging the united states into a confrontation with the economy no such war has yet it seems clear that the united states has already lost china has been steadily gaining in the global economic system waging war against is making case a former head of the division at the international monetary argues that the long term china comes out a winner no matter economy would surely suffer if the united states were to impose a 45 percent tariff on nearly billion worth of imports the united states absorbs only 16 percent of but it is healthiest export market fears of protectionism are already stoking capital flight from china but china might be better placed than the united states to take the blow and it would certainly an editorial in global a communist party is probably not far off in its warning that action would batch of orders will be replaced by airbus auto and sales in china will suffer a and soybean and maize imports will be china has several ways to retaliate it could bar companies from doing business with businesses it could limit access to essential as it did in response to a fishing dispute with japan by stopping exports of rare earth minerals essential to the electronics industry it could efforts to combat the piracy of patents and copyrights some of the united most successful companies would be in for a rough ride most of for are assembled in china the assembly account for less than 4 percent of the value added of the device that means china could force a halt in production at little cost to while apple would face a deeply expensive effort to shift production elsewhere building it from scratch in the united states is nearly impossible how long could resolve an analysis by the institute for international economics concluded that a trade war with china and would push unemployment in the united states to nearly 9 percent in from 4 9 percent today that would not improve the economic outlook for millions of in whose name trump proposed this fight and that may not even be the worst part circling the wagons around the border plays directly into hands in other ways would be cast as the villain in the fight no matter how many tricks the government might deploy against it would remain the victim in the eyes of many a champion for the cause of open trade even if trump is just as many of his allies to gain leverage in some future much of the damage has been done his bluster has changed the perception of the role the united states will play in the world in the face of a turn toward populist nationalism in other rich countries like and china has emerged in the unlikely role of defender of capitalism is the one major power still talking about increased said a china specialist at the institute is the only major country in the world projecting the idea that brings and that is the united loss a great many countries in the developing world still believe prosperity depends on their successful integration into the supply chains that traverse the global economy by turning inward a move already reinforced by the rejection of the partnership the united states appears to have little to offer trade conveyed that point only a few days after the election by saying that his nation would work to conclude the regional comprehensive economic partnership a initiative among 16 and pacific countries that excludes the united states and would support proposed free trade area of the pacific ditto for and according to a senior official in are also now seeking to join the trade initiative certainly every economy in the region sees its future lying more closely linked with the former told me trump talking about withdrawing from trade deals and making allies pay for it will be tough for countries to resist and if actions against china start to disrupt supply the united states could quickly become the economic pariah the question to what it simply be about stopping currency manipulation an outdated fear instead of working to lower the value of its currency to improve its china has spent about trillion lately to prop up the value of the in the face of capital flight if it the currency would drop like a enhancing trade competitiveness slapping trade barriers against china would do little to narrow the trade deficit companies building things in china bring much manufacturing in most cases they would go to some other country with cheap labor and to the extent they did most of it would be highly employing few additional does not make economic sense for trump to want to balance trade with said a china specialist at the conservative enterprise institute trade bring back trump might look like a resolute in his defense of the working class but any increase in popularity would be unlikely to last as the consequences started to become apparent has already been playing a relatively weak hand trying to contain influence china has skillfully deployed investments to win over countries from to broadening its network of influence its proposed infrastructure bank despite opposition from the after and other allies jumped on board is becoming a leading member of the international wrote in his new book but the west by being into existing institutions under the current rules of the china is other countries into the system of rules it wants to trump just gave alternative system of rules a big push forward
thank you for being guide to thriving in the age of l pp from trump to to marine one thing that unites the unhappy west is a profound sense of mystification across and north people have an acute feeling that their world is accelerating away from them but they quite understand why there is no narrative hence the attraction of leaders who it like it and identify convenient like immigrants or the union but what most people really crave is an honest explanation as with patients on a the first step is to understand what is going wrong then you can decide on the medication into this darkened room steps tom while other journalists dream of being investigative reporters or news l is a whose goal is to be a from to and he is extremely good at it a talent for explanation has garnered him a column at the new times and a string of books on huge subjects like and climate change snooty critics might grumble about his folksy but it is hard to think of any other journalist who has explained as many complicated subjects to so many people now he has written his most ambitious book part personal part manifesto you for being has two overt aims wants to explain why the world is the way it is why so many things seem to be spinning out of especially for the white middle class he grew up in and then he wants to reassure us that it is basically going to be in general the explanation is more convincing than the reassurance but as a guide for perplexed this book is very hard to beat argues that man is actually a fairly adaptable creature the problem is that our capacity to adapt is being outpaced by a built from three ever faster the market and climate change that sounds like a predictable but digs cleverly into each one for on technology he argues convincingly that which saw the arrival of the android and was the year when software in the words of the he introduces us to vital obscure like and he points out that if law the power of microchips would double about every two had applied to the capabilities of not computer then the modern descendant of the 1971 beetle would travel at 300 , 000 miles per cost 4 cents and use one tank of gasoline in a lifetime the chapters on climate change and the market are stuffed with similar nuggets but also shows how all three forces complicating and speeding up one another in climate change is wrecking crops even as technology is helping more children so a population of 19 million will reach 72 million hungry people by 2050 on trading technology and markets create so a operating out of his flat by can make the index fall 9 percent in a and will keep getting faster there are already at least 10 billion things connected to the but that is still less than 1 percent of the possible total as ever more gadgets and bodies join of man has sped up his own response times it now takes us only 10 15 years to get used to the sort of technological changes that we used to absorb in a couple of but what good is that when technology becomes obsolete every five to seven the supernova is making a joke of both patent law and education companies and individuals are all struggling to keep up it can be bewildering even for the winners like himself in he was queuing up to phone his stories from telephone now he can email a column from deep in that appears almost instantaneously on the times website and provokes a rapid reaction from china in two and a half years researching this he had to interview all the main technologists at least because things changed so quickly like everybody he has no time to the title comes from an offhand comment to a friend whose tardiness allowed a few welcome minutes of contemplation for the most you for being is a master class in explaining it canters along at a pace that is quick enough to permit learning without getting bogged down inevitably he sometimes gets the balance either allowing his informants to ramble or skating over a thorny for having admitted that productivity numbers have not forward in the same way that technology he asks in to trust they will the folksiness will still irk some the starting point for the book is a chat with a parking with another attendant from waiting near the end but criticizing for humanizing and boiling down big topics is like complaining that used sex to sell it is what he does well there is also a value in bringing things together in putting foreign policy beside climate change and be fooled by the catchy slogans not into and so as usual with it is all backed up by pages of serious reporting from around the world this complaint is that the explaining is too convincing lying on the listening to him in his guise as tom you ever more the reasons the world is spinning so fast it is not all along the way we discover that the created more teller jobs at banks it allowed banks to increase the number of there are inspiring stories of communities rising to the and a memorable paean to the virtues of chickens from bill gates empower keep children healthy and but respite from these there is there is not going to be and attempts to stop it all will do more damage than good this makes it harder to reassure us that it is all going to be fine produces a list of 18 things that the government should from setting up a health system to passing deals and building infrastructure if the politicians in accomplished even a quarter of his the united states would be better
maybe i have been surprised that trump could be elected but i was i live in and work in two of the most liberal places in the country but even i seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in that failure makes sense spent nearly 10 years coaching and and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i want to and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an or clicked on a or hid the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i realize that most of my family who live in rural were voicing their support for trump and i see any of the that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my and the only election day i saw were of people declaring their support for to be not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my they did exactly what i told them to blocking out misogynist and hiding anyone who support black lives all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than 40 percent of our population consumes news on finding alternative perspectives have been that hard i knew about theory on filter or the idea that personalization distorts the type of information we and even i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my and yet i look in mark chief executive of addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network he has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever he said gone from a world of isolated communities to one global and we are all better off for but not what has happened idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on the political divide has only been entrenched further the dress only for our entire we are two one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like and is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into but there have still been a few islands of digital a of where culture thrived untouched they included vine closure was announced in and and even which were homes for marginalized theories and lifestyles the vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see aware a young woman living in who goes by the name used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the goofing off at home in her most viral she stares into the her face covered in a save for her perfectly outlined eyes called me she snaps the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the and people did so with meaning that vines appeared around the defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text direct email vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black named who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty you can draw a straight line from brown women in to black women in a marvel unto a window into the way the flattens space and time a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge

watching people in and showing off their routines and customs but the company is now prioritizing which feature more mainstream events like the super bowl and music festivals the effect is still but

warner was also named in the suit and hired top lawyers who put trump through an unsparing deposition asked about his trump was caught lying or exaggerating 30 times thought get a friendly and we would roll says who is now the executive editor of view the case went through four judges and was dismissed in 2009 suit against is one of seven forays trump and his companies have made as libel plaintiffs he won only when a defendant failed to appear but the standard measure defending his reputation and achieving victory in court how trump says he thinks about his investment spent a couple of bucks on legal and they spent a whole lot he told the post in march about the hefty sum he spent on the case against did it to make his life which happy trump was warner books spent less than he and paid nothing but that make central idea any less that libel law can be a tool of revenge disconcerting for a maybe not as rich as he plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics once installed in the white trump will have a wider array of tools at his and his record suggests more than his he will try to use the press and also control and subdue it as a trump

our legal safeguards for writers and publishers foolproof in the last few trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press the members of this club are innovators they have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy but an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like or even destroy entire media outlets this kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection only 40 percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the trusts the media report the news accurately and according to a survey conducted in 2015 this mistrust has been growing for a long but it was stoked by trump during the campaign he called the reporters who covered him and whipped up yelling and booing crowds there is no consensus among his supporters that the press should hold those in power accountable a recent pew survey found that only half of trump backers agreed that it was important in a strong democracy that organizations are free to criticize political media outlets have won many

until i still believed my moral baseline bent toward empathy the i thought i where i lived for 21 was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable the state did elect walker as governor in and the legislature gutted setting off huge protests in the capitol but i think that state would vote for j turning its 10 electoral votes to a republican for the first time since 1984 come we even voted for as much as trump won the election in lost it her which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper particularly and and instead treated those states as a given is the mayor of capital in cerulean county he supported senator sanders in the democratic and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the sanders campaign during the primary but once locked up the it was radio silence from the campaign i first held elected office in the early virtually every presidential been either by the candidate or by a he told me not saying this to say important but the point not only she in the but i never got a a anything after the president by made two campaign stops in during the 2012 including a huge rally with on the before election day frustration with the campaign was apparent understand the strategy never seen an explanation for other than assuming that they wanted not just a but a smashing victory the kind that trump he said voter turnout in 2016 was the lowest been in 20 years roughly 40 , 000 fewer democrats voted in county this year than did in 2012 the drop in turnout in county might be partially attributed to a voter identification law in the state in a federal

alone could not have flipped the state in favor did not visit once after the democratic national convention in neither did president or sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of but that was not enough to gin up enthusiasm like most of the my friends and family in were shocked that trump won the and the election my mom says still in my dad has progressed comfortably to anger my has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit listening to trump speeches about i was convinced to she emailed me i hate throughout the general the surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate republican voters in suburbs every democrat we lose in western we will pick up two moderate republicans in the suburbs in and you can repeat that in and and new senator chuck said in this line of thinking was not just but disastrously so in won 59 of 72 counties this 59 counties voted for trump republicans successfully built on the map

a federal judge on dismissed a lawsuit that accused president of waging an illegal war against the clearing the way for the conflict to continue under j trump without explicit congressional authorization in a judge colleen of the federal district court for the district of ruled that the plaintiff an army captain who until deployed to to participate in the conflict lacked the standing to bring the case judge also said that whether the war had been properly authorized was a question for the two elected branches of not a to decide case raises questions that are committed to the political branches of she wrote court is not well equipped to resolve these and the political branches who are so equipped do not appear to be in dispute as to their the capt had said that while he supported fighting the state as a matter of he believed that the current effort violated the constitution and the war powers which limits combat operations to 60 days if congress has not authorized the deployment because he swore an oath to uphold the he he worried that obeying orders to participate in the operation violated his oath but judge said captain desire to have a court clarify the legal issues was not a sufficient injury to give him a right to bring the case while there are precedents in which courts ruled that soldiers did have a right to challenge the legality of their orders to she noted that those cases involved plaintiffs who did not support that war effort the dispute began in 2014 when the state swept out of and rapidly conquered large areas of and ordered to halt the advance the president said that while he would like a vote from congress to endorse the he needed no new legal permission because operations against the state were covered by the authorization to use military force against the perpetrators of the sept terrorist attacks that that theory was controversial while the state used to be affiliate in the two organizations had split earlier in 2014 but in a court the administration argued that congress had ratified its theory by continuing to appropriate billions of dollars for the knowing how the executive branch was interpreting its authority while the two sides traded judge said she did not need to hear from them in oral arguments before ruling for the government a lawyer for captain said his client was now stationed at fort in but was subject to redeployment to the middle east to participate in the war operation through 2018 decision is said makes the war powers resolution a dead letter by closing off challenges to violations a lost opportunity to clarify the scope of the 2001 authorization for use of military which president is using as the basis to fight a foe that even exist back then it sets conditions for standing that few officers will be able to meet we are considering whether to
j trump ran for president boasting that he knew more about fighting terrorists than generals but now that trump is the he is spending a great deal of his time with retired and those of a particular commanders when they were often at odds with president one has been named as national security and several others are candidates for coveted positions in his cabinet or are advising him on how to confront the greatest threats they would give his foreign policy a far more aggressive cast than turning to the retired officers reflects preference for having even men around him but it worries national security experts and even other retired who say that if trump stacks critical jobs purely with it could lead to an undue emphasis on military force in foreign policy you have too many generals in the the dish is likely to be baked with even more military instruments said john a a retired army lieutenant colonel and an expert in counterinsurgency strategy not sure the recipe the united states needs for every foreign policy inclination toward generals in top jobs also runs counter to the credo of civilian control of the military a constitutionally enshrined principle that some say safeguards the united states from becoming another or where the military is a political player in the last trump has met with n a retired marine corps who has emerged as a leading candidate for

strained history of these generals with his predecessor is less a liability than a credential is sticking his tongue out at the prior said h a professor emeritus of history at the university of north at chapel hill who has written about civilian control of the military is inherently distrustful of the military people that the system throws up at him he thinks not strong people they are trump might also view generals in his administration as a political asset at a time when trust in institutions like congress and the news media is the military remains enduringly popular general in commands wide respect from uniformed men and women especially who revere him as one of their own on trump wrote on twitter that general was a k the chief said the incoming administration was looking at potential

two weeks after j trump swept to investors from around the world are betting that his promises of tax fewer regulations and a spendthrift federal government can recharge the economy this burst of exuberance sent the major markets to record highs on as investors continued to pull out of government bond funds whose yields are miserly the momentum has shown few signs of slowing and has resulted in significant flows of money being poured into united states stocks the rush of money has also pushed up the value of the dollar against the currencies of developed such as the and those of developing nations like turkey and a strong dollar that is underpinned by rising interest rates tends to spell trouble for emerging as investors move money from these creating havoc and making it harder for governments and corporations to pay off their debts for that many economists have warned that the downside to a revival of the united states economy is a spate of calamities in emerging as investors head quickly for the exit the recent euphoria stands in sharp contrast to wall before the of market mayhem if trump were to win the view had been that his unpredictable ways would spook the financial not least his threat to rip up trade agreements with and fight china on its exports to the united states after a sharp but very brief slide in trading on election when it became clear that trump would markets rallied quickly as the trump economic agenda was quickly assessed two weeks is a short period of time in investment but the current wave of enthusiasm recalls the days after election in when investors around the world embraced his sunny view of business potential this thing you will see people piling on and the prosperity will blow you said a evangelist who advised on economic policy and is doing the same with trump said little about the budget deficits and the surge in debt that resulted from policies but his ebullience mirrors the mood in the markets as investors choose to set aside gloomier notions and bet instead on a jamboree in stocks that will they hope be supported by a economic boom at the root of the economists and investors is the view that republican control of the senate and as well as the white will put an end to the divisive politics of the years that prevented his administration from taking more direct steps to stimulate the economy political analysts point to the fact that while democrats have been criticizing the on many on the one subject investors have rallied around the most infrastructure spending there has been broad agreement with the when it comes to market this one does not match the record set during president first when the standard index rose 84 5 percent if the markets were to duplicate that gain during a trump the 500 would have to be over 4 , 000 by late according to standard global market intelligence the stock market boom was fueled by an unprecedented period of central bank activism in the years after the 2008 financial crisis central bankers around the world flooded markets with easy liquidity that flowed into every type of financial asset with interest rates on the rise and inflation picking central banks are now in retreat that means that the trump administration will need fiscal policy government spending and tax cuts rather than relying on the federal reserve on four major measures of the stock

foreign governments means compensation for labor or services and the clause says that person holding any office of profit or shall of any office or of any kind from any prince or foreign unless congress consents it took j a justice department official who is now a federal appeals court judge in 13 pages to answer question two things were he wrote the emoluments clause applied to the and the which included a check for about was the sort of thing that would be barred if it came from a foreign state in the concluded that could accept the prize because the committee that chose him was independent of the government and the prize itself was privately financed but he said that the answer would be different if a foreign government sought to make a payment to a sitting president in a

ventures include real estate arrangements with companies either as a full owner or a partner in and the bank of china is a tenant in trump tower and a lender for another building in midtown where

foreign to the extent that not an dollar in excess that they pay over the fair market price will be a dollar paid in violation of the emoluments clause and will be a present to the supreme court has never squarely considered the scope of the and there are no historical analogies to help understand how it should apply to a president who owns a sprawling international business empire earlier presidents worked hard to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest involving a foreign said zephyr a law professor at who ran for congress in new this year as a democrat and lost reason we really have a lot of precedent here is that presidents in the past have gone out of their way to avoid getting even close to the emoluments she said but if trump takes a different it is not clear that anyone would have standing to challenge him in court are a lot of very smart lawyers turning that question over in their minds adding that a business competitor injured by foreign favoritism toward a trump company might have standing but w who was the chief white house ethics lawyer for president w bush from 2005 to said such a business most likely would not have standing to sue not there to protect a he said of the clause there to protect the united states the way to address violations of the painter is not a lawsuit but impeachment lawmakers could take steps short of particularly because the clause itself describes a role for which can give its consent to payments that would otherwise be barred painter said congress should embrace that role by passing a resolution directed at trump should send a clear message to him that he should divest his and that they will regard dealings with his companies that he owns abroad and any entities owned by foreign governments as a potential violation of the emoluments clause unless he can prove it was an he said professor agreed that congress had constitutional obligation to make sure that trump violating this would think the

j trump on released a turning to social media to deliver a message in which he vowed to create renegotiate trade end restrictions on energy production and impose bans on lobbying trump offered what he called an update on his which he said was going efficiently and reading from a script and looking into a he steered clear of his most inflammatory campaign promises to deport immigrants and track and his pledge to repeal the affordable care act producing building cars or curing i want the next generation of production and innovation to happen right in our great creating wealth and jobs for trump said in the video the brief video offered one of the few opportunities for the public to hear from trump directly since he was elected two weeks ago the has declined to hold a news conference since his and instead has used twitter bursts to communicate trump gave a brief speech after called him on 9 and he sat for an interview with the wall street journal and an surrounded by his on last week since he has mostly been behind closed doors as he assembles a cabinet and white house team in the trump described his plans to great on day but his message seemed aimed less at the supporters who chanted that slogan at rallies and more at the who remain skeptical about it the appeared to try to emphasize his appeal to those voters at the end of the and he promised to provide more updates as he worked together with everyone to reach his goals i mean he emphasized the video underscored the extent to which trump intends to try to navigate around the traditional newspaper and television media outlets as he seeks to communicate his message to the public who served as white house press secretary under w said trump was using technology to communicate with the public in a format that staff would never have dreamed of doing 15 years because the news media would have dismissed it as propaganda president has become adept at doing the same thing in recent through videos posted on and other media just doing more of what president successfully and what fascinated about what does this mean for the on the met privately with television executives in a confidential session that was described later as a sometimes contentious effort to clear the air after a campaign season in which trump often clashed with members of the media trump is also scheduled to meet with editors and reporters at the new times on but his decision to deliver a highly scripted video message suggests that like is eager to embrace new media opportunities by twitter which he enjoys had 15 7 million followers once in the white he will inherit with its 12 1 million followers trump also spent at his office in trump interviewing a stream of potential republican cabinet candidates they included rick a former governor of former senator brown of and representative of a democrat perhaps the most interesting thing about video was what he did not say in it on he avoided any mention of his plan to build a wall along the border with or his desire to deport immigrants here whether or not they have a criminal record he made no mention of ending president program that grants work permits to immigrants who were brought illegally to the united states as children trump simply promised to direct the labor department to investigate visa abuses the who has often railed against and for what he often called their conduct of foreign said nothing in the video about fighting confronting aggression or pressuring allies to pay more for their common defense he said he would ask his top military officials for a comprehensive plan to guard vital infrastructure from and all other form of other promises in the video recapped points that he made repeatedly during the offering a series of executive actions that he says he will order on his first full day in the oval office like his pledge to our notification of intent to withdraw from the trade will be well within his power as president to accomplish but his additional promise to bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back onto will be in the eyes of the and may not produce the results he expects others appear to be overblown political like his promise in the video to restrictions on the production of energy including shale energy and clean coal creating many millions of he did not specify in the short video what restrictions he will lift or how that would result in of jobs even supporters of the keystone oil which trump has said he will once in do not believe it would create millions of jobs if it was built said more inclusive tone in the video was the latest example of a pattern he set during the campaign of dialing back his impulse for fiery speech when he felt it was in his interest has said this about that he knows how to be really boring when he wants to said of trump so about the fact that there are these two and seeing more of the other one since he

when it comes to predicting how j administration will affect schools and education experts say they are struggling to read the tea leaves fundamental issue is that nobody really knows what the trump administration is on said m a conservative education policy expert at a panel discussion in last he joked that trademark educational achievement thus creating the controversial trump placed him in history alongside another the founder of the university of been all over the map on a number of these the director of education policy studies for the enterprise said during a panel discussion on at the an education nonprofit is among education experts and policy makers since the have been trying to figure out what a trump administration might do for education starting with whether there will even be a federal department of education trump suggested during the campaign that the agency might be on the chopping though the statement seemed more like a sound bite than a policy pronouncement on the campaign statements on education were largely like a series of short some seemingly contradictory and it is not clear whether his policies will hew closely to the republican agenda or fall more in line with his populist streak signature education proposal to provide billion in federal money to allow students to select private or charter schools is one area where he seems to be borrowing policy from vice mike pence as governor of pence championed school choice and favored a smaller federal role in education while arguing that trump should be taken seriously on education because he wants to cut college costs and improve said pronouncements so far were not based on fully formed policy billion figure for school choice came out of said know that trump has been all over the place on student a number of names have been floated as possible choices for education secretary trump met over the weekend with a former district of schools a democrat who reversed her opposition to school vouchers in 2013 and has supported common core standards another possible candidate is m an education expert at the a think tank was a senior adviser at the education department during president w administration office has not responded to requests for interviews on his education but he and people close to him have dropped a few clues here is an overview of what schools and universities might expect during the trump school choice in a speech at a charter school in trump rolled out the banner element in his education plan the billion program to promote along with the federal states also would be encouraged to kick dollars into a pool so that children could select their including private and charter schools representative an republican who founded the congressional school choice caucus and is friends with suggested in an interview that some of the money for school choice program could come from title a billion education program for schools but critics say letting title 1 money follow students to schools outside their referred to in education speak as title 1 would take money away from public schools teachers unions have opposed the idea of expanding funding for charter schools is a real question about resources being drained from public said the president of the federation of teachers common core in an interview with fox news in last trump may cut department of education i believe common core is a very bad the may have reflected a bit of a misunderstanding common core an initiative to standardize educational requirements throughout the were adopted by states under a recently enacted the federal government is prohibited from telling states what educational standards to adopt so the department of education has no authority over common core anyway facilities the administration has taken the position that schools must permit students to use the restrooms and locker rooms of their choice the republican platform calls that policy illegal and dangerous but in a television interview in trump said people should go to any restroom they want took him up on the invitation student debt in a speech in last trump called college debt an around and suggested a way out students would pay 12 5 percent of their income each year for 15 years after their loans could be forgiven but there is already a similar currently requiring payment of 10 percent of income over 20 years d also of the enterprise said repayment plan would cost the government more and would give a huge break to students with higher student usually those with advanced degrees there has been some thought that trump plans to turn student lending over to private banks and take the government out of the equation but there is no evidence that trump has endorsed that idea both liberal and conservative experts said the proposal would be dead on arrival on capitol hill anyway would cost taxpayers tens of billions of said a former adviser to education secretary john b king as

j trump said during the campaign that he would push companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the united states he named one tech company in particular apple which is the largest public company and makes many of its gadgets overseas apple does make one product the mac pro desktop computer is assembled in through the contract manufacturer flex so a new times tech recently visited to see what having tech manufacturing domestically has wrought for apple and the area what he found was a more nuanced picture showing that manufacturing is far from the only way for a tech company to provide good jobs and career paths for it turns out apple has a campus in where the number of jobs has grown reaching about 6 , 000 jobs up from around 2 , 100 seven years ago the roles that apple has created there are including fielding overseeing logistics with suppliers and updating maps software the average salary of including is a year the manufacturing jobs at located about a mile from the apple are also of course flex added about 2 , 000 jobs for the mac pro desktop but they are not the only kinds of jobs a tech company can now create
city the roman catholic church will allow priests throughout the world to grant absolution for the said on making permanent a policy that pope announced a year ago in a document marking the conclusion of the yearlong jubilee of the pope extended a policy of allowing priests and not only bishops or special confessors to grant forgiveness for which the church considers a sin the announcement was a signal of the vision of a more merciful and inclusive church while firmly restating his opposition to abortion as grave since it puts an end to an innocent the pope affirmed that is no sin that mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the the an apostolic was signed on after a mass denoting the end of the jubilee year it was made public on pope decision last at the start of the followed in the footsteps of pope john who granted priests the same right during the previous holy in 2000 under canon abortion brings automatic excommunication unless the person receiving or performing it confesses and receives absolution abortion is considered a meaning that permission to grant forgiveness usually must come from a bishop bishops could already delegate the authority to grant absolution to parish priests and many bishops in the united states had done so but the practice varied widely by country and even by diocese in parts of the observant catholics who have sought absolution for abortions have faced delays at or even rejection in some priests have been delegated the power to absolve abortions during certain times of like archbishop the president of the pontifical council for promoting new said at a news conference at the on that right is extended to all he noting that changes would have to be made to canon law to reflect the new practice the decision underscores the idea of a church that leaves nobody outside its and the apostolic letter calls on the clergy and the 1 2 billion catholics to and to upon the message at the heart of the yearlong meditation on mercy in the a blend of religious teachings and acute social delineates the path of the future life of the church so that it can always be an instrument of mercy toward without ever excluding archbishop said the archbishop said that the apostolic letter offered guidelines to priests who were called on to exercise referring to an proclamation on family life among other created a path for divorced and remarried catholics to receive holy communion letter also noted that the church would celebrate a world day of the poor every help communities and each of the baptized to reflect on how poverty is at the very heart of the he also called on the faithful to a culture of mercy based on the rediscovery of encounter with a culture in which no one looks at another with indifference or turns away from the suffering of our brothers and at a ceremony naming 17 new cardinals on the pope warned against what he described as a of polarization and he said that heart there are no and chided those who build barriers and label the comments were seen by some observers as a rebuke to calls by j trump to build a border wall and to restrict from entering the united states pope did not single out any but he has expressed dismay over the harsh tone on immigration that trump has taken in the pope suggested that trump was because of the campaign promise to build a wall on the united border who is not called the admonishments the pope on denounced the tendency to treat an immigrant or a as the warning that such thinking invited hatred by our differences turn into symptoms of threats and he said harassment and violence against immigrants and other marginalized groups surged after election day in the united according to the southern poverty law which tracks hate crimes and domestic extremist groups
the election of j trump gives the republicans in congress a chance to act on their desire to get rid of a wish that trump mostly says he shares e and the health policy analysts for the then i think safe to say few in congress thought they would have this opportunity but like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the after untold futile republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the affordable care act now comes the essential will they actually do been promising it but i am still skeptical that it will happen i believe you disagree going to let you go first why do you think do i think do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of having passed bills to partly delay or the in the house something like 60 times just the other day senator endorsed repeal the house and senate also agreed to do in large in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year the only thing that prevented it was that president vetoed it i doubt trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity i know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full because according to the rules it can only touch provisions this excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime among other measures i also must add that much less confident of a repeal partial without agreement on a replacement but turn it back to do you think the has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer i think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier but not too much a part of me that thinks many in congress were always so willing to vote for a because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law they got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than 20 million people of their health without anything in return this would be an unmitigated political disaster the stories of people with diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold would very likely dominate our discussion for months that leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the 2018 midterm elections with no democratic leaders in any branch of government to i think this would be akin to what happened in the 2010 but in reverse if they can coalesce around a plan that leave too many people then i think they could move forward but in all the years since the was republicans been able to do that do you think they what do you think that plan would look one way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that call for repeal for several at least after the 2018 though possibly after the 2020 election between now and there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces that just dump people off coverage with no alternative but the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly absolutely there will be bad stories but keep in there will be bad stories under too rocketing huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if making better actually in a tough policy spot get the blame if they fix or repeal the and get the blame if they replace it with something people like better health policy is a very difficult and thankless task i think opt for something they can call repeal and but they could also just let struggle and die neither looks good one other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states do you think a trump working with a will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from if what are some ideas states might i think very likely those in congress could punt to the states for been trying to change funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time this will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce spending in the while forcing states to make the tough decisions and take the blame for cuts in either beneficiaries or services fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the is a different story without some sort of market which generally been opposed the same problems that existed with respect to conditions and individual ratings will exist many people will become uninsured annual and lifetime limits could reappear lots of people will have problems getting insured i have yet to be convinced that a significant number of republicans in the house might coalesce around such a plan maybe for but not sure about the exchanges even if they likely the democrats in the senate would try to filibuster either of these plans you i think democrats would filibuster anything they could the filibuster is not set in stone a senate majority can change and some are already calling for the to do so but that appear to be what the senate will do retain the filibuster this could play to their since they can propose things they let the democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement perhaps another way for republicans to get out of their political bind sure have more to discuss as president administration comes into power

a question has been posed in a puzzled whisper in many of the living rooms and newsrooms ever since j triumph in this presidential is white white nationalists have happily embraced victory his choice of k as chief as a win for their agenda a barrage of groups that fight discrimination and hate speech in criticized warning that his embrace of the movement was little more than an attempt to racism and white nationalism into something palatable enough for mass consumption and much of the rest of the country has been left to wonder what this unfamiliar term actually means while white nationalism certainly overlaps with white supremacy and many political scientists say it is a distinct phenomenon one that was a powerful but force during the presidential election and will most likely remain a potent factor in and politics in coming years a professor of politics at university in has spent years studying the ways that ethnicity intersects with politics while most researchers in that field focus on ethnic professor does the he studies the behavior of ethnic particularly whites in the united states and white he is the belief that national identity should be built around white and that white people should therefore maintain both a demographic majority and dominance of the culture and public life like white white nationalism places the interests of white people over those of other racial groups white supremacists and white nationalists both believe that racial discrimination should be incorporated into law and policy some will see the distinction between white nationalism and white supremacy as a semantic sleight of hand but although many white supremacists are also white and vice professor says the terms are not white supremacy is based on a racist belief that white people are innately superior to people of other white nationalism is about maintaining political and economic not just a numerical majority or cultural hegemony for a long he white nationalism was less an ideology than the default presumption of life until quite white could easily see the nation as essentially an extension of their own ethnic group but the changing the civil rights movement and a push for multiculturalism in many quarters mean that white are now confronting the prospect of a nation that is no longer built solely around their own identity for many white of the growing diversity is something to celebrate but for others it is a source of stress the white nationalist movement has drawn support from that latter group its supporters argue that the united states should protect its white majority by sharply limiting and perhaps even by compelling nonwhite citizens to leave appointment of as his senior counselor and chief west wing strategist more than brought white nationalism to the forefront of conversation he is the former editor of a site he described in august to mother as platform of the although the is ideologically broader than white nationalism it also includes and trolls white nationalism makes up a significant part of its appeal for b who runs the website is also the director of the national policy an organization that says it is devoted to protecting the and future of people of descent in the united and around the argues that immigration and multiculturalism are threats to white and has said his ideal is a white he has avoided discussing the details of how this might be saying it is still just a but has called for ethnic to remove nonwhite people from soil the trump told the new times upon his appointment that he does not share those views but under his news has gone to considerable lengths to cater to an audience that does and in a 2015 radio interview that was resurfaced this week by the opposed even highly skilled implying he believed it was a threat to culture or of the in silicon valley are from south or from i think he trailing off before continuing a moment country is more than an economy a civic white including have rejoiced at appointment to such a senior position in the trump white house but focusing on figures like may obscure the more significant way that white nationalist ideas are affecting politics and fueling the rise of politicians like trump in the united states as well as populist movements in and continental several studies of other countries have found that a desire to protect traditional values and culture is the strongest predictor of support for the sort of populism that propelled trump to power in the united states many of those voters would not think of themselves as white and the cultural values and traditions they seek to protect are not necessarily explicitly racial those traditions formed when national identity and culture were essentially synonymous with whiteness so the impulse to protect them from social and demographic change is essentially an attempt to turn back the clock to a time a recent working paper by a political scientist at school of and a political scientist at the university of based on an analysis of survey that populists have succeeded by appealing to the cultural anxiety of groups like older white who once formed the cultural majority in western societies have recently seen their predominance and privilege a professor of politics at the university of bergen in came to a similar conclusion after studying policies in their she were motivated by a desire to protect their national culture suggesting they believed that immigrants posed a threat to it criticism of immigrants and promise to great may have tapped into those same cultural fueling his success with older and white voters he won white voters by 21 percentage professor argues that anxiety over white identity and populist politicians can have a symbiotic each strengthening the other when populist politicians gain mainstream that can make white nationalist ideas more socially acceptable not just a question of ethnic change and people being alarmed over he said also a question of what
three years i read of huckleberry to my daughter she smiled as she heard about his his but it was his relationship with the runaway slave that intrigued her most and travel together as seeks his at wrestles with his decision to help in the tom sawyer concocts an elaborate scheme for release when we finished the my daughter had a why tom just tell the truth that miss had already freed him in her she is not alone in scholars have long debated this issue one answer lies in white which needs black identity in order to define and therefore cannot exist without it is a vexing word it is racial or sexual or national or religious or all those things at once sometimes it is proudly other times hidden or denied but the word is almost never applied to whiteness racial identity is taken to be exclusive to people of when we speak about it is in connection with or or or native people or some other group that has been designated a minority is seen as the the absence of race in school one month is reserved for the study of black while the rest of the year is just plain people will tell you they are fans of black or but few will claim they love white music this election has disturbed that silence the earned the votes of a majority of white people while running a campaign that explicitly and consistently appealed to white identity and anxiety at the heart of this anxiety is white increasing awareness that they will become a statistical minority in this country within a generation the paradox is that they have no language to speak about their own identity is a category that has afforded them an evasion from rather than an opportunity to confront it in his campaign for the trump regularly tied problems to others immigration must be he told to stop the rapists and drug dealers coming here from terrorism could be stopped by banning from entering the country the big banks would not be held in check by his whose picture he tweeted alongside a star of the only people that the never faulted for anything were whites these people he spoke of not as an indistinguishable mass but as a multitude of victims of a system that was increasingly rigged against them a common refrain in the days after the election was all his voters are but this will not because those voters chose a candidate who promised them relief from their problems at the expense of other races they may claim innocence but it seems to me that when a leading chapter of the announces plans to hold a victory parade for the the time for innocence is long past racism is a necessary explanation for what happened on but it is not a sufficient one last when the subject of racial identity came up at the democratic primary debate in the moderator surprised many viewers by asking about white the middle of this the nation is going to be majority she said public schools are already there if white are about to be are already underemployed in many and one study found they are dying they have a reason to be said she was concerned about every including white communities we are seeing an increase in earlier she said she planned to revitalize what she called and explore spending more in communities with persistent generational poverty senator sanders took a different can talk about it as a racial he said it is a general economic workers of all he have been hurt by trade deals like need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this this resonated with come from the working and from the significant portion of it that is not white neither of my parents went to college they managed to put their children through school and buy a home a life for many in the working is impossible now nine months after that we have found out exactly how much attention we should have been paying such families the same white voters who four years ago did not cast their ballots for this year these voters suffer from economic disadvantages even as they enjoy racial advantages but it is impossible for them to notice these racial advantages if they live in rural areas where everyone around them is white what they perceive instead is the cruel sense of being forgotten by the political class and condescended to by the cultural one while poor white voters are being scrutinized less attention has been paid to voters who are white and rich white voters flocked to trump by a wide and he won a majority of voters who earn more than a despite their relative economic safety a majority of white women chose even though more than a dozen women have accused him of sexual assault the top issue that drove voters to the polls was not the economy more voters concerned about that went to it was an issue on which abandoned serious debate and become engulfed in sensational stories about rapists crossing the southern border or the pending imposition of law in the if whiteness is no longer the default and is to be treated as an identity a then perhaps it is time white people considered the disadvantages of being a race the next time a white man bombs an abortion clinic or goes on a shooting rampage on a college white people might have to be lectured on religious tolerance and called upon to denounce the violent extremists in their midst the opioid epidemic in white communities could be treated the way we once treated the crack epidemic in black ones not as a failure of the government to take care of its people but as a failure of the race the fact that this has not nor is it likely only serves as

by the time b the leading ideologue of the movement and the final speaker of the rose to address a gathering of his followers on the crowd was restless in 11 hours of speeches and panel discussions in a federal building named after a few blocks from the white a succession of speakers had laid out a harsh vision for the but had denounced violence and said that citizens and black had nothing to fear earlier in the himself had urged the group to start acting less like an underground organization and more like the establishment but now his tone changed as he began to tell the audience of more than 200 mostly young what they had been waiting to hear he railed against with a quoted propaganda in the original he belonged to white whom he called the of the a race of conquerors and creators who had been marginalized but in the era of j were to their own as he several audience members had their arms outstretched in a salute called hail our and the translation of the exhortation the room shouted back these are exultant times for the which was little known until this when it embraced campaign and he appeared to embrace it back he chose as his campaign chairman k the media executive who ran the most prominent and then named him as a senior adviser and chief strategist now the leaders hope to if not a seat at the at least the ear of the trump white house while many of its racist views are well known that president or may as well of foreign that the black lives matter movement is another name for black race that even the children of undocumented immigrants should be deported the has

conference was overtly racist and demeaning toward for much of the day the sentiments were expressed in ways that seemed intended to not sound too menacing the focus was on how whites were marginalized and beleaguered one peter the founder of an asked if had the national council of la and had the whites were reluctant to organize for their rights some speakers made an effort to distance themselves from more notorious white power organizations like the but as the night wore on and most reporters had gone the language changed speech began with a polemic against the before he briefly paused we should refer to them in the original he said the audience immediately screamed reviving a word that means suggested that the news media had been critical of trump throughout the campaign in order to protect interests he mused about the political commentators who gave trump little chance of winning wonders if these people are people at or instead soulless he referring to a fable about the a clay giant that a rabbi brings to life to protect the was victory of a phrase that echoed the title of the most famous propaganda film but then with a the leader who advocated a homeland in quoting

four barbers and a firefighter were pondering their future under a trump presidency at the upper barbershop last week got to figure this said one of the barbers got a gangster in the chair he referring to j trump they admitted that they could not complain too only two of them had voted but there were no regrets feel trimming a mustache is tired both of them were terrible they never do anything for us as democrats pick through the wreckage of the one lesson is the election was notable as much for the people who did not show as for those who did about half of eligible voters did not cast ballots a state that had assumed she would historically boasts one of the highest rates of voter this 68 3 percent turnout was the fifth best among the 50 states but by local it was a the lowest turnout in 16 years and those were important trump won the state by just 27 , 000 voters neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnout figures of the 15 council the decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen in more prosperous areas accounting for half of the overall decline in turnout citywide the biggest drop was here in district a stretch of fading wooden sandwich shops and restaurants that is 84 percent black in this voter turnout declined by 19 5 percent from 2012 according to executive director of the city of election commission it is home to some of poorest residents according to a 2016 has one of the highest incarceration rates at upper a bustling barbershop in a wooden talk of politics inevitably comes back to one elections infused many here with a feeling of connection to national politics they had never before experienced but their lives have not gotten appreciably and sourness has set in went to the said owner of the juice a brightly painted shop a few blocks down west north using a metaphor to describe the emotion after election then eight years all four barbers had voted for but only two could muster the enthusiasm to vote this time and even it was a sort of protest one wrote in democratic senator sanders of the other wrote in himself so said who had written in sanders he said no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black including whom he voted for twice like i should have known this would happen worse off than but did do something did give black people something to aspire to a lot happy my son was able to see a black who has been trimming beards and mustaches for 30 had hoped his small business would get easier to run but it us or a he trimming the mustache of a firefighter from the neighborhood his biggest issue was health insurance lost his coverage after his divorce three years ago and has struggled to find a policy he could afford he finally found which starts but costs too much at a month none of this been he said he did not vote of the election said other factors contributed to the decline in turnout this was the first general election under new state laws that required voters to produce an approved photo id and that stiffened the requirements for new voters to prove their residence this was particularly onerous for the who move often said he believed this change had cost several thousand people in the city their vote me very he said takes away from the fairness and integrity of the although two federal district courts had ruled that the photo id law discriminated against who disproportionately lack the approved the law was applied on election day after an appeals court stayed one of the decisions gov a republican who backed the has said they have no impact on voter and allowed that their effect on turnout would not have erased victory in the state perhaps the biggest drags on voter turnout in as in the rest of the were the candidates themselves to it was like having to choose between broccoli and liver felt said who works the grill at delicatessen and says he did not vote were stuck between trump and they really left us with no an avid supporter of spent months trying to convince him to vote for her but he could not get over his revulsion at what he saw as trust issues related to the foundation grandfather pushed him toward but he found him even less he thought would be a good candidate would you vote for he said in a loud voice to a line of customers vote for said a financial services worker waiting for her sandwich has a level head and few of the men and women interviewed on west north street last week had voted for though many said they admired him spoke his mind he was i would have i would have voted for said a security guard working the evening shift at a business i loved as for countries probably have respected us because we had a woman running the he said one exception was who said he voted for trump as a protest against he blamed her policies for putting him in prison for 20 years as for the claims of racism that have dogged so worried better than smiling to my face but going behind closed doors and voting against our he said a program coordinator at a local agreed was unlike a lot of liberal democrats who are just as but keep it he his jaw slathered with shaving cream can reason with them all day but they think they know it all they want to have control that they know best for he voted for as did many others here upper gets busier as the day wears on children come in after school stopped
the mark went on his vast social network to convince an expanding chorus of critics including the departing president of the united states that he wants to combat the that is running wild across his site and and turning our politics into a paranoiac fantasy come to life been working on this problem for a long time and we take this responsibility he wrote made significant but there is more work to be he listing various steps was like making it easier to report bad information and enlisting organizations it was heartening to especially after his earlier assertion that it was to believe that misinformation on had affected the presidential election in any real way despite copious evidence that it was disturbingly in the whether it directly swung the result or not but as went on to say that had to be careful not to mistakenly block he added do not want to be arbiters of truth which was why he said would continue to rely on community and trusted third his statement pointed up how much struggles to find the balance between its mission to be a utopia for its 1 8 billion users and its responsibility to protect them from all that is dangerous terrorist and untrue but more to the it appeared to buy into the notion that truth is relative at a time when that notion has to finally go away do you really need an outside arbiter to determine whether a video suggesting without basis that was involved in john f fatal plane crash in 1999 should be allowed to truth need arbiters it needs defenders and it needs them now more than ever as the democracy staggers into its next uncertain phase with a mainstream news media that works hard to separate fact from fiction under economic and political which has contributed to that economic threat by gobbling up so much of the advertising market is going to have a special responsibility to do its part just imagine what things will look like if the unsavory elements that tore through the 2016 election false fake news and aggressive efforts to traditional journalism come back into play as j trump presses to enact his agenda if the past week provided any indication of where politics are the next four years are going to require an effort to keep the national conversation honest the national security adviser trump named last t a retired army lieutenant has subscribed to the conspiracy theory that law is taking root in the united states contributing to his insistence that have every reason to view as he recently used twitter to circulate a fake news item that the federal bureau of investigation was sitting on evidence from laptop that would and her crew away for nominee for attorney senator sessions of has falsely claimed that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants are successfully crossing the border annually then there was the announcement by the conspiracy theorist that trump had called to thank him and his radio and audience for their support in the campaign add to that the fact that trump was the most prominent promoter of the false notion that president born and hesitate to repeat the outrageous suggestion that the father of senator was linked to the assassination of president john f then consider what it may look like when trump pursues policies regarding immigrants and undocumented immigrants not so outlandish to envision attempts to sell his plans getting a lift from the likes of or a fake site out of perhaps claiming that democrats are working with to use undocumented immigrants to poison local water supplies or some such president seemed to have had something like that in mind when he told reporters in on we are not serious about facts and true and and we discriminate between serious arguments and then we have knows of what he speaks he had to muddle through the first wave of this you might remember how his health care plan was marred by a false accusation that the plan included death panels that would decide who lived and who died based on their of productivity to as former gov put it her the false allegation was partly based on proposals to reimburse doctors for optional consultations with families over care decisions the accusations took on such power that even newt signed on to the falsehood despite the fact that he had previously expressed bullish support for planning explained himself in a 2009 letter to the new news including this debunked the myth but the authors stripped out the provision just the same and by then the fiction had negated any shot at a ideological debate as who was the chief communications strategist at the so grimly put it to me last death panels were the canary in the coal mine about the coming death of things have advanced since then fake news is limited only by the imaginations of its inventors and the number of shares it can garner on or twitter the one million shares of the preposterous notion that secretly sold weapons to news which has excelled at illuminating the fake news problem highlighted that example in its alarming analysis showing that during the campaign cycle fake news was shared among users more often than real news why people who care about the truth journalists social media giants like too will have to come up with a solution to this informational fast easier said than done the combination of attacks seeking to serious news organizations and a drop in overall trust in the news media has made many people wary of legitimate as my colleague john noted last politicized voices can easily drown honest journalism all too easily on social media there is growing talk of an ambitious journalistic collaboration to beat back the tide industry thinkers and leaders are coming together to brainstorm as the city university of new journalism and the have done them out and say

in for the first the census bureau counted more people living in urbanized than in the countryside this been a rural nation ever since yet the idea of agrarian has receded slowly despite demographic change we still romanticize the family though relatively few of them exist anymore we view even suburbia in pastoral terms the as the historian t put it as the recent electoral college results make we still live with political institutions that have baked in a distinctly by design the democratic candidate for president has now won the popular vote in six of the last seven elections but in part because the system empowers rural for the second time in that the candidate who garnered the most votes will not be president rural even as it laments its economic retains vastly disproportionate electoral strength rural voters were able to nudge j trump to power despite large margins in cities like new in a house of representatives that structurally disadvantages democrats because of their tight urban rural voters helped republicans hold their cushion in the the least populous states are now more overrepresented than ever before and the growing unity of rural as a voting bloc has converted the rural bias in national politics into a potent republican advantage talking about a political system that skews not as important if there a major cleavage between rural and urban voting said a professor of government and politics at the university of urban and rural voting behavior is so starkly different now so that this has major political consequences for who has power not just in terms of policy she continued pervasively advantages republicans in maintaining control of the national the electoral college is just one example of how an increasingly urban country has inherited the political structures of a rural past states containing just 17 percent of the a historic can theoretically elect a senate lee said the bias also shapes the house of representatives it as a in the formulas that determine where highway funds are spent or who gets homeland security dollars it exists in state where bills preferred by urban delegations have been much more likely to be rejected the influence of rural voters also evokes deeply rooted ideals about who have power in and argued that the strength of the nation would always derive from its agrarian soil had this vision of what they called the this person who owed nothing to who receive any payments from the who live by a but who could support himself and his family on a farm growing everything they needed and that these were the people who were going to be the backbone of said a political scientist at the university of describing what could be the forefathers of the rural voters who tilted this election when the framers of the constitution were still debating the shape of institutions we have 95 percent of was as the 1790 census classified the population the compromise at the time created the one chamber granting equal voice to every state to counterbalance the where more populous states spoke louder and they made sure the compromise stuck equal state representation in the senate is the only provision in the constitution that remains singled out for protection from the amendment no state can lose its full complement of senators without its permission but even as a deliberately undemocratic the senate has slipped further out of alignment with the population over time the senate simply favored sparsely populated politicians in sparsely populated states to leverage the skewed power we talk about all of that was an intentional policy said a political scientist at the university of republicans in congress passed the 1862 homestead offering free land to settlers who would move to territories that would eventually become states creating more senate seats and electoral college votes for a republican party eager to keep government control away from southern democrats they even managed to divide the territory into two worth twice the political power as the plains later depopulated and then the senate became even more unrepresentative suspicion of big cities also appears in the sites of state and not new city and not st and not political scientists at the university of have found that most state capitals were located near what was then the population centroid of each state typically closer to the geographical center of the and not the place where the most people already breaking with how much of the world sited its capitals the state legislatures there also grew significantly less representative as urbanized in when lawyers in brought what would be a seminal case before the supreme court challenging the the state legislature had not reapportioned its districts to reflect population change in 60 years was still using districts drawn in 1867 even states that had constitutions requiring equal population districts were ignoring them and new gave small counties 100 times the voting power of the most populous ones decades ago in county had the same representation in the senate as county a population over six justified it because that was a cultural it was just the way things said a professor of government rural legislators had no incentive to change a system that favored them just let it keep getting worse in power why by the no state approximated majority rule at the and m wrote in their book end of had some of the most unequal representation in the world a series of supreme court cases beginning with that complaint upended this system and established the standard that equal representation means one not one one vote or one one senator only the united states protected by the remained unchanged the house retains a rural bias republican voters are more efficiently distributed across the country than who are concentrated in cities that means that even when democrats win 50 percent of voters they invariably hold fewer than 50 percent of house regardless of partisan gerrymandering the electoral college

president said here on while j trump was unlikely to reverse the warming of ties with he would almost certainly trade deals in are going to be tensions that probably around trade more than told an audience of students and young leaders from the campaigned on looking at every trade policy and potentially reversing those even on trump will have a tough time making drastic changes to united states said once they look at how i think actually determine that working for both the united states and our said friendships established with countries like the reopening of diplomatic relations with investments making in environmental policies and so forth all those things i expect to he added trump has offered contradictory views on relations early in his trump claimed to support restoring but he said more recently in that should have gotten a better deal was speaking to aspiring entrepreneurs and civil society leaders about how to improve their lives and countries one of his preferred activities during the last stop of his final overseas trip as president he began his trip on in went to on and flew to on to attend the economic cooperation summit meeting along the he has with limited to reassure audiences that trump will not discard the agreements and priorities that has devoted much of his presidency to advancing his toughest task was here at a summit meeting of an organization that helped birth the partnership trade an accord that is almost certainly dead as a result of victory one of signature campaign strategies was to immigrants from and he referred to those crossing the border from as rapists and criminals just about every question posed to from the audience here had to do with the anxiety trump has stirred in this part of the world united states is such a big country after any people are said think it will be important for people around the world to not make immediate he also predicted that relations between and the united states would not change much main message i want you to know is that you have a partner in me and you have a partner in the united states said to applause we are going to work part of the reason relations are unlikely to change he is that the united security depends on faring well enough that their people decide to remain home instead of attempting the arduous journey to enter the united states illegally best way for my daughters to be secure in is to make sure that people in or el are also feeling secure if that may spill over the borders to he said while the illegal migration of has largely halted in recent gang violence in el and has combined with economic desperation to drive migrants from those countries to seek safety in other mainly the united states answering a question on from a audience painted a dark portrait of the progress of freedom around the and said the wave of countries adopting democratic governance had reversed itself seeing some countries that are going backward rather than forwards in terms of freedom of freedom of the in terms of respecting political opposition and civil he said economy is nearing collapse as its government cracks down on opposition leaders in an increasingly desperate effort to cling to power also said a growing number of people were now arguing that democracy is incompatible with development success over the past 30 years in creating a manufacturing colossus through its authoritarian measures has some particularly in insisting that too much democracy can be detrimental but said over the long countries that pursue transparency and accountability fare far better than those that do not this time that we live development is based on knowledge and innovation and education and new thinking and sharing of said in authoritarian economies respond poorly to change because their populations are not as or as he said can maintain order for a while with repressive nondemocratic but it will rot from said those governments fail and those economies told the crowd here to avoid fervent nationalism and identity which he said could lead to conflicts the most important thing about you is that you are an drawing an implicit contrast with the one thing that defines then you may end up being threatened by people from other when in fact you may have a lot in common and you may miss trump has defined his governing philosophy as and has already appointed avowed nationalists to top positions in his administration described himself as a proud but said the world was far too interconnected for leaders to be wholly focused on their own nations pollution in then that affects you here in he said
president is considering removing s rogers from his posts as leader of the national security agency and united states command after top officials expressed frustration over the speed at which admiral rogers had moved to combat the state and over the repeated loss of closely guarded administration and intelligence officials said j trump is considering admiral who is responsible for surveillance and the growing arsenal of for a top post in his including director of national intelligence overseeing all 16 intelligence agencies admiral rogers met with trump on apparently without the white knowledge the recommendation to remove admiral a career intelligence officer who was promoted to his posts by the administration two years came last month from defense secretary b carter and the current director of national r clapper administration and intelligence who insisted on anonymity to detail the private said the recommendation that admiral rogers be removed was not related to interest in hiring him they it was driven by breaches during admiral tenure at the and his leadership of the agency the white house and the pentagon declined to comment on admiral fate reached by phone on admiral rogers declined to comment the effort to force out admiral which was first reported by the puts trump in the position of considering whether to as the man who would brief him on intelligence matters each a admiral whom the white house is considering relieving of his posts it also raises the question of why would consider firing one of the top intelligence officers in the last days of his administration admiral replacement would not be confirmed until after trump takes over one senior intelligence official argued that letting word of the effort leak seemed more about politics or vengeance than about effecting any real change representative of the chairman of the house intelligence committee and a member of transition strongly defended admiral rogers in a letter to carter and asked them to testify before his committee to explain why they want to push rogers out not by accident that admiral rogers meets with the and two days later this which is completely built on said in a short interview carter and clapper had submitted a formal recommendation to the white house to split the which conducts foreign surveillance and secures military from the command but there are questions inside the giant complex at fort where the and command are about whether the military is ready to survive on its own it relies heavily on the talent of the which dates back to the early who has begun filling the top echelons of his national security team with met with admiral rogers on at trump tower in new senior defense department and intelligence officials were surprised that admiral while on personal had paid a visit to trump first major disagreement with admiral rogers dates to the fall of when he expressed mounting frustration that which is responsible for offensive action against was not acting aggressively enough to disrupt the networks in and in the carter said for the first time that the united states was using its against the state but the effort was moving too slowly for the pentagon and carter went to fort several weeks ago to give admiral rogers and his team kick in the one official said top national security officials had also come to see admiral rogers as lacking leadership at a moment of wrenching change for the he took command after the disclosures of widespread surveillance by j the former and the efforts he directed to seal up the agency proved they said that perception was underlined by the disclosure in that the had secretly arrested a former t martin and was investigating whether he had stolen and disclosed highly classified computer code developed by the agency to hack into the networks of foreign governments martin was charged with theft of government property and the unauthorized removal or retention of classified documents administration officials had planned to relieve admiral rogers of his duties after the election and announce a plan to create separate chains of command for the and command but the supported by carter and stalled in part because of opposition from senator john republican of who heads the armed services committee under the command would remain under the armed services but oversight of the would shift to the senate intelligence committee victory complicated the planning on one major trump and admiral rogers disagree quite publicly while trump has insisted that no one knows whether was responsible for the hacking of email accounts of the democratic national committee and a range of prominent formal admiral rogers has said he has no doubt he recently said that was not something that was done this was not something that was done by this was not a target that was selected purely he was a conscious effort by a to attempt to achieve a specific coming into the admiral rogers said one

senator chuck of new planning on being leader of the senate minority and by extension the democratic opposition as the trump era dawns in the capital i regret what said who was hoping to be president right hand as senate majority leader before both he and came up short of their election day goals moments at do i think what could have i am fully occupied with the job at said in an interview in his senate office on just a few days after being formally chosen by his colleagues to succeed his senator harry of as leader of the senate democrats that in is to serve as the bulwark against a unified republican government led by his former campaign j to use the power of the senate minority to try to force compromise when and to stand in the way of republicans when necessary are the said noting that the rules of the senate at least as they currently exist give democrats there much more power than their house counterparts to hold the line against republican policies they oppose he is going to agree on issues like trade and transportation infrastructure in a very real way with we have an obligation to pursue said about who quickly reached out to by phone after his presidential victory at the same we have an obligation to oppose him on all the places where he tramples on our travels with racism or just dismantles things because the right wing tells him to do so that is where we are it is a delicate balance and talk of cutting deals with trump and senator the republican and majority has already alarmed some democrats who want no cooperation whatsoever with trump or the senate republicans who sat on president supreme court nomination of b garland would be a dereliction of our responsibility if we said who munched casually on a frozen three musketeers bar as he laid out his vision long as we sell we have an obligation to the millions of who are those are at the center of emerging strategy he believes that trump won by appealing to the middle of with what was essentially a democratic economic message on trade and job creation he is convinced he can leverage that with the new president are president you have two work with us and you will have to alienate your republican or break your promises to he said believe that voted for trump mainly because of democratic issues like not for republican issues like tax cuts for the that any legislation that can entice democrats will have to be substantial and not be used to chip away at other or they will not hesitate to oppose it for he noted that he had quickly issued a statement skeptical of the nomination of senator the republican and occasional senate gym workout for attorney and would be giving all nominees thorough scrutiny and he said some issues were simply such as reversing wall street and banking reforms enacted after the 2008 economic collapse it comes to repealing any of as they say in said the who also said democrats would not cooperate in any way with overturning the affordable care act democrats did pick up two seats with wins in and new narrowing the republican majority and making it that much more difficult for to round up the 60 votes needed to overcome or perhaps even muster a simple majority though we get the those two votes will be invaluable in stopping republicans from doing bad said does not believe republicans will be eager to eliminate the ability to mount filibusters against preserving a chief minority weapon he hopes that any supreme court nominee can win bipartisan but if republicans threaten to eliminate the ability to filibuster he has an argument ready said to you come before this with clean hands because of what you did with who even get a hearing and who was clearly a mainstream said after an increasingly strained relationship between and believes he can negotiate with the top republican wants to make things work and i want to make things he said we will certainly both stand for our principles and each side will respect the we can get a lot more done than has been done in the but it will definitely be a challenge and it was not the one had hoped to face

a toxic political war over jobs and killed the vast and complex trade deal that was supposed to be a signature legacy of president but the between the united states and 11 and pacific was never just about trade the the was conceived as a vital move in the increasingly tense chess match between china and the united states for economic and military influence in the and most strategically uncertain part of the world the which excluded was intended to give those 11 nations more leverage in that strained match by providing them with a viable economic alternative and its defeat is an unalloyed triumph for the country that j trump castigated repeatedly over trade in comments just before meeting his who laboriously negotiated the made no reference to its near certain burial is always a useful occasion for us to get together and examine how we can make sure that creating more more opportunity and greater prosperity for all of our said wonderful to see all of you and i look forward to a

undertones much of has for decades quietly accepted security guarantees while also running large trade surpluses with the united turning them into prosperous manufacturing powerhouses but china is now the largest trading partner for most of the while at the same time making territorial claims against many of its neighbors the neighbors fear they could soon face a stark choice among pride and accede to security or lose access to vast market question is whether pulls back from and makes it easier for china to force countries in the region to make a choice between china and the united said a senior fellow at the institution when it comes to the shift in policy is likely to be among the most pronounced in the new administration born in in the middle of the pacific and raised partly in since his earliest days as pushed as his best opportunity for growth other than efforts to end two wars begun by his principal foreign policy goal was to shift the attention and military resources away from an aging and an unproductive rivalry with and toward the region it is a goal he partly shared with president w whose administration began the negotiations for the partnership saw the pact as a bulwark against rising strategic ambitions has spent much of the last 10 days putting a brave face on the crushing blow that surprising electoral victory represented to his legacy hours after the results became he told the country and his own weeping staff that all actually on one on he suggested republicans would find replacing his health care law difficult and in visits on and to and he told panicked that trump would preserve the alliance but the meetings this at the trade will very likely have a more funereal feel more than on any other and trump have diametrically opposing views on trade and trump has won even white house aides have admitted to their bitter defeat about the current but we believe what we believe about the value of trade and the importance of the region to the united said j a deputy national security adviser the allegiances are starting to shift after election just three days before arrival foreign said the country still hoped the pacific pact would someday become a reality but given the changing his government also opened talks this autumn with to join the trade the regional comprehensive economic partnership trump is not so interested in requiring economic integration and trade why not have other countries follow this asked song a longtime trade specialist who is the deputy director of the center for studies at university in shanghai since the

relationship with the united states instead of replacing it with ties to china move no doubt that the focus will to the prime minister of japan told his parliament on met with trump on since trade negotiators from and 12 other nations have been meeting several times a year to stitch together the regional comprehensive economic partnership and with those efforts are almost certain to accelerate

j trump made coal a centerpiece of his holding rousing rallies with miners in hard who he said had been neglected under eight years of the administration the strategy paid helping him score crucial wins in and coal may prove a different sort of symbol that of the challenges that the will face delivering on his many promises to restore struggling sectors of the economy the united states coal industry and the jobs that support it have been in decline for decades as a result of environmental automation in mining and slowdowns in manufacturing industries that burned coal for power and these no matter who is coal is at the mercy of market economics no 1 rival is natural gas which could become an even more potent competitor under the incoming administration the probable easing of restrictions on pipeline building and loosening of rules on gas exploration and production would mean more natural gas reaching the market despite recent price has been drifting downward for years but the price of natural gas has fallen even more sharply think the trump presidency will have a material impact on bringing coal miners back to said a coal analyst at trading a leading energy industry research firm may eliminate the regulatory referring to the environmental rules that have cast a shadow over i have a hard time seeing a surge in coal long decline predates president arrival in the white house in 2009 the collapse of the steel industry in late 20th century reduced demand for the metallurgical coal that is mined most prominently in in utilities have been slow to build new power plants in recent decades because of concerns over the burning of the other type of coal thermal coal that is used for power plants and is mined across the country trump campaigned to help both kinds of coal recover but natural gas may prove unbeatable the hydraulic fracturing boom in shale fields that began a decade ago flooded the market with cheap natural gas that continues to erode market share as recently as early coal was the source of roughly half of the electricity generated in the united states now it is down to about 30 percent just a lot of gas in this and that is going to hold gas prices said chief executive of pioneer natural a major oil and natural gas who said he voted for trump the bleak outlook for coal may explain why some of the executives have been reluctant to comment on how the trump presidency may help their they may be wary of raising false hopes among their workers and many may be reluctant to repeat past industry arguments that climate change was a hoax coal producers would rather have tax incentives to support environmental improvements for as a way to ensure viability even beyond a trump administration exuberance has to be said vice president for government and public affairs at cloud peak a major western coal producer view should be cautious beyond the declining demand for there has been an even more fundamental factor behind the shift in coal mining which peaked decades ago as with those in many jobs in mining have fallen victim to automation shears can now shave coal from underground seams work that formerly required hundreds of miners surface which has been increasing in recent has also replaced many workers with heavy machinery as a there are now just over 50 , 000 jobs in the coal mining down from a peak of more than 250 , 000 in 1980 most of the losses have come in mines which produce coal for making steel and electricity because they are deeper and more expensive to operate but automation is hitting employment in mines across the country industry is simply not going to produce the number of jobs that were historically available in the coal said c a law professor at west who focuses on coal issues a few years ago coal executives hoped exports which represent about 8 percent of national production would boom along with the economies of china and the developing world but exports peaked in 2012 since slower economic growth in the developing along with climate and pollution have depressed demand for coal the same considerations have prompted international development banks and large investment companies like chase and bank of to pull back on financing new plants a trend that is unlikely to change under trump the trump administration could help the coal industry somewhat by unwinding president clean power which was designed to replace utility plants with those using natural gas and renewable energy sources but the effects of the plan so far may be hard to reverse the tighter air pollution which are still under challenge in forced utilities to choose between revamping aging power plants to make them or switching to natural gas or green sources like wind and solar utilities across the country typically decided to switch last as a 94 power plants were closed across the and this year 40 more are expected to close by the end of it is most unlikely that trump could do anything to bring those plants back the older power plants that burned eastern coal have been basically torn put in some of them said j the former vice president for operations at a subsidiary of energy that was sold to another operator last year other marginal measures the trump administration might be able to take on industry executives include rolling back the rules that protect streams from surface mining and easing those for leases and royalties on coal mined on federal lands industry executives say that to extend the life of at least some of the 400 or so power plants still in use in the united the trump administration and lawmakers in congress could work with them on initiatives acknowledging that climate change is an issue even if trump does of cloud peak energy wants federal incentives for utilities to refit existing
populists have scrambled to outdo one another in celebrating j trump as an president who shares many of their attitudes less thrilled are the in and the problem is v already has one of most conservative which took office a year ago and top leaders have eagerly cast election as the latest and most crucial chapter in a global shift away from liberal democracy but they also see a worrisome the chummy noises trump has made toward the president even as the government may share many of conservative attitudes and nationalist polish leaders are restrained by a almost visceral distrust of him memories of domination during the soviet era are still raw and has been one of the most hawkish members of the union on taking a hard line toward the polish predicament is yet another reminder of how thoroughly the trump victory has scrambled the geopolitics of his campaign remarks undercutting and suggesting that the united states could possibly walk away from the alarmed leaders in the and in even after trump softened his remarks most of and the rest of will now wait and see whether the victory of who apparently has an affinity for is an opportunity for or an existential threat prime minister of who had already made friendly gestures toward sees opportunity many poles still see risks can do is keep increasing its military keep a low profile and just wait for to show his true said a political analyst and historian who supports the governing law and justice party it take too for polish leaders have a strategy to praise victory as a continuation of their own focus on areas of agreement with the new president and play as much as disagreements over things like how to deal with prime joined other leaders in declaring victory a validation of the rise of a more nationalistic and muscular form of government with a strong executive and resurgent patriotism certain era in world politics an era when politics focused on elites and dealing with issues of the she said won despite the liberal but at the same was quick to add that his country still expected the united states to abide by its commitments and to proceed with plans to deploy including thousands of this spring along the eastern flank of even some members of own republican party do not agree on the best way to approach whether to continue international as or to seize the moment to develop a closer relationship that ends as fears and the geographically closer to have insisted on maintaining pressure on parliament voted almost unanimously with just one abstention to maintain economic sanctions as punishment for annexation of and aggression in eastern for instance on key along with president pledged to renew those sanctions but more leaders have indicated they might agree to end the sanctions presidents who were elected just this month in and had talked during their campaigns about doing just while political leaders and analysts in and elsewhere expect trump to move quickly to negotiate a new with they suspect also wants to move not only to end the sanctions that are squeezing his economy but to head off that planned spring deployment of troops polish officials have preferred to express confidence despite the troubling the new president in the end will abide by and union commitments think we can be confident that policy toward and thus also our relations will not that at least they will not become said after a brief phone conversation with trump this past week maybe we will be able to strengthen them even polish leaders have focused on the more welcome statements trump has like his promise to try to change rules that force poles to get visas to visit the united long a sore point and they have steadfastly defended trump from criticism in more liberal corners of as a the government which has chafed under international criticism that its moves to marginalize the constitutional court amounted to an undemocratic attack on the rule of law hopes that victory will create an atmosphere in which it can resolve that crisis more to liking problem is not that there is a perception that is under immediate threat from said head of the section at the center for eastern studies in an independent but research group problem is rather this uncertainty caused by the mixed signals that have come out of the trump w assured a gathering of voters that the trump administration would abide by its treaty including going to the military aid of any member state that is attacked but then newt also acting as a trump remarked that if he were president he would not necessarily go to the aid of which he described as essentially a suburb of st sending a shiver down the spine of many eastern leaders and the candidate himself alternated between telling that would stand behind its ally and making comments about outlived its usefulness optimists point out that pretty much every recent president went into office hoping to refresh relations with only to see those efforts stall w bush and also announced a policy of rapprochement with said peter the director of the political capital a research group in in the none of them polish officials and analysts saying they hope to cement strong relations with the trump administration stressing shared concerns like immigration and national sovereignty and hope trump does not surrender too in the short in his desire for a deal with make a deal with and then expect it to keep the terms of the said the political analyst never a real partnership with it will take everything the is willing to and then just keep on testing the new the underlying polish officials and analysts is that the j trump of the campaign praising belittling bashing trade treaties will be different from the j trump in the oval office any weakening of the alliance would have a huge impact
here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment 1 this is what unqualified looks like never expected to win and never planned to govern he just loved the adulation he got from spreading his brand of hate now we have a completely unprepared administration trying desperately to do in 7 weeks what it should have been preparing for over the last 18 months the disaster begins 2 it seems that billy bush has been one of the few to be held accountable for his words and participation in the onslaught of racism and misogyny in the campaign and now appointments all others are ascending to the highest offices in the land as a teacher i am already seeing the repercussions of having individuals in high office have no consequences for their bigoted remarks when a student in my diverse classroom does not understand why it is hurtful to yell the in the middle of class i can blame our leaders the misogyny will continue if we do not hold people accountable 3 someone who understands the threat that poses to the west avoid the mistakes of and other countries where the dominating instincts of the most dangerous religion have been allowed to flourish 4 i find it really ironic that all the groups that think they have a mandate to enforce are so intolerant of controversial views and people that run counter to their own maybe the moral and ethical standards of are not that repugnant in the like trump who has said some unfortunate as has that he if political correctness gets pushed to the business and progress grinds to a halt in fear of legal accusations that become paralyzing how many lives have to be ruined by such enforced and what about the controversial manipulators on the other side like who will hold them to 5 infrastructure child tax paid maternity leave and dismantling trade sounds a bit like some of platform slice and dice identity politics are all well and good in the it is all about the economy and too many of our fellow citizens are hurting wake and return to the or continue to lose 6 this sad news hurts like the loss of a family member clarity and moderate tone brought so much to the frantic scene this is the worst possible moment to lose her special gift for analyzing politics and bringing contending parties together in a civil conversation 7 i am considering many grad schools in the for my master course next fall before the i only looked at the the the requirements and the fee and campus life i really have to think about the safety as an i expect anyone to stop me in the street and tell me to get back to china i am not so although i was so sure about some schools in and i have to sit down once and closely look at the and hope that they are not too red this election changed my mind about 8 for a you are a white male somewhere in who just lost his job at a factory your mortgage is in your car is being and you wonder whether be able to find a much less one that pays a decent wage you have no particular animosity towards but you constantly hear the message that as a straight you are the paragon of privilege and that the hardships in your life are irrelevant or made up you feel so privileged are your struggles and fears really so different from those of the minority easy to see why that person voted for the candidate who acknowledged his fears and against the candidate who dismissed his concerns because he was not a minority 9 less patient with sexism and talking down and more likely to stand up for others the day after the all of the young women in my office dressed in head to toe black no one no one knew that the other women would be dressed but we all were sending a conscious message of and it was comforting to see and feel that kind of solidarity 10 this is a what locker room talk should be

there to keep watch those conservatives who insisted that electing j trump president would be a grievous mistake a group that included radio prominent columnists and some of the most savvy political operators in the country are now saying they see an upside to four years of a trump white house but even as they find small those who counted themselves part of the trump opposition are wondering what their place will be for the next four years in a republican party they can hardly recognize and they have begun to ponder what it all means for a conservative movement they thought they understood better said the radio host who became a vocal opponent of during the republican primaries he was describing how he had arrived at peace with the election he he realized that he had not done so at all kind of have to a lot of what you thought about the shape of he said not just that that you fundamentally misread what what is so disorienting for many conservatives is that the trump victory was the culmination of the unruly populist upwelling in first manifested in the tea party that traditional republicans thought they could eventually absorb those forces have overtaken them one by one first claiming their house majority then their john a and then an entire field of presidential candidates now it may claim their party some on team are already boasting how they plan to break with decades of conservative orthodoxy on government spending and pursue a huge infrastructure spending package that sounds more than conservatives are going to go k senior counselor and chief gleefully told the reporter in an interview published negative interest rates throughout the the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything get them all jacked said who has aimed almost as much fire at what he regards as establishment republicans as he has at democrats will be as exciting as the greater than the some conservatives say they could surely live with a few of the proposals of they find like a big spending especially if they come with sweeteners like tax breaks or spending cuts in other areas the easiest way to forge many are is to disassociate the man from the policy will do everything i can to help said senator republican of south who has refused on numerous other occasions to help including voting for him or attending the republican national convention graham told reporters on capitol

transition team encouraged on several fronts by the possibility of the republican congress working with the new said for citing the prospect of repealing some of president energy policies along with the affordable care act but as with any period of acceptance comes in different ways some find catharsis in writing others console themselves in data that show they really were not all that wrong then there are those who still talk as if they are in they have good days and bad days goes said bill the weekly standard editor and leading who has written columns about his coming to terms with trump any given said in an he feels a range of competing sentiments sort of somewhere between but and but he using modified versions of famous quote about how he approached negotiating with the soviets on the subject of it is hard not to talk to conservatives today about trump and not have them wistfully invoke their said he feared people were drawing parallels to trump that risk setting the wrong standards for success revolution that he beat jimmy carter in he said that i love that the revolution was that he governed successfully for eight years and won the cold others are concerned that the conservative movement missed an opportunity to appeal to a younger and more diverse group of voters and they wonder how it will do so with someone as divisive as trump atop the republican party a conservative radio host in and prominent pointed to the tens of thousands of voters in and states trump barely won who voted in other races but did not cast a vote for evidently because they could not bring themselves to vote for him not lightning in a he making the point that trump repelled so many voters that he almost lost like you showed up for work and they said this is your last paycheck and

still struggles with did this who are your what do they actually

democrats and republicans in this fiercely contested political battleground have regularly resorted to creative legal maneuvers and changes in their efforts to wring every last vote from the nearly seven million voters but even by that the hairbreadth race for governor is plowing litigious and acrimonious ground scrambling to save the incumbent pat republicans said they were pursuing protests in about half of north 100 alleging that fraud and technical troubles had pushed the democratic attorney general to a statewide lead of more than 6 , 500 votes but county elections including one here in turned back some of the challenges on the legal and political jockeying raised the specter of a and it could ultimately climax in a political wild using a state law to contest the election in the general assembly supposed to have an inauguration on a republican said we going to have a i is what most people are going to start wondering pretty the race this year was among the most bitterly contested campaigns in the country the state was a prime battleground in the presidential and it has been fractured by debates about and abortion republicans largely prevailed here on election j trump won north by more than three percentage and senator burr was by a larger margin but struggled the aftermath has become a protracted spectacle campaign said this week that there were instances of votes being cast by dead felons or individuals who voted more than a spokesman for ford replied that the governor had a new standard for such arguments helped transform what might have been perfunctory meetings of elections regulators into crucial sessions that stirred frustration on both sides in a democratic officials held a gathering with sworn an lawyer and detailed discussions about the mechanics of elections is not a situation where politics enters into j a republican who is the chairman of the county elections sternly told the crowded hearing room to widespread laughter and skepticism but to the delight of the critics who filled the the elections board unanimously spurned a challenge that the north republican general had filed according to preliminary cooper won the county by nearly 90 , 000 or about 59 percentage points county will not certify its count until at least are a lot of protests out there going to specific issues that are 15 more votes here and stark said by the time you move a lot of votes if not resolved at the it will end up at the state and the state board will have to sort it all as other county elections boards rejected challenges from allies on the critics complained of baseless protests that they believed were intended to discredit north political climate small in poorly researched and often a lawyer for the southern coalition for social said of the republican challenges ms who was monitoring proceedings in nearby wake which includes the state said some challenges brought by supporters had been easily rebuffed through a few minutes of research a spokesman for the said that the campaign expected people who brought the unsuccessful challenges to appeal to the state board of which comprises three republicans and two democrats county elections boards are made up of two republicans and one democrat the wrangling plays out in a state that has often been the epicenter of the national debate about voter identification requirements and changes to elections rules when north democrats controlled the state government in recent they sought to cement their franchise by enacting a string of laws that made it easier to register and aiming in part to recruit more black voters combined with enforcement of the federal voting rights the effect was by turnout among who are overwhelmingly soared to 68 5 up from about 42 percent in 2000 but when republicans gained absolute control over the executive and legislative branches after the 2012 they set about undoing the framework democrats had built after the united states supreme court struck down a crucial part of the voting rights state legislators pared early imposed a photo id requirement and ended registration a federal appeals court ruled against much of that law in concluding it had targeted black voters with surgical that decision faces an uncertain future before a supreme court poised to have a justice nominated by trump but the immediate question in north is how long will dispute the results and whether he might ultimately ask the general assembly to consider the election under state the legislature could order a new election it can determine which candidate received the highest number of it may declare a winner the law asserts that the decision in such a contest is by the courts said talk about legislative involvement to be but not going to

something is deeply wrong when the reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as fantasy news to claim that he has endorsed a presidential and then be through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright because they are easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people when might call their work or admit that in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be and that is and maybe to deal with for many and especially opponents of j the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president talked passionately about it on it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every and is at risk of being not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on websites were prevalent in this election were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright image posted by individuals and shared by and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan page operators for a magazine article this it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional it contained much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a posted on a website and promoted on a page copied from another site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on the father of a slain who had spoken out against j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a sinister its insinuating mention of in proximity to mentions of and its misleading and strategic mention of amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this clearly designed to function well within economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up as a broad media offensive especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of and by the candidate himself as the campaign criticism of trump was instantly projected back at his or at the critics themselves puppet no puppet the this tactic was used on the language of social which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new but it was newly effective it matter that its targets knew that it was a a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they but realized that nobody could make them listen as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news as widely understood and has already begun to encompass not just fabricated but a wider swath of traditional media on and elsewhere fox fake news misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in fake news the entirety of fake news this wide formulation of will be applied back to the traditional news which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things even when they are may try to address the narrow version of the the clearly fabricated posts has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside anyway another narrow response from could be to assert editorial control over external forces tried to a very limited with trending topics members of the editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a upon reaching some high threshold of or a upon reaching some cumulative could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the for example but where would that leave the rest of the answered and and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a news environment in which almost everything there before remained the main difference being that it would have all been not fake is a place where people construct and project identities to family and peers it is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities it is a system built on ranking and vetting and and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely and where conflict is resolved with isolation that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy for it has been a source of constant fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the economy more than most of the organizations that are identifying them their removal will be an improvement the outrage at their mere and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the will have been justified

political opponents pressed him on the claims during the trump doubled saying he would eventually reopen trump university something i could have settled many trump said during a debate in could settle it right now for very little but i want to do it out of he people that took the course all signed most many many signed report cards saying it was it was it was but the position of trump and his legal

many in the middle east reacted with a mix of suspicion and scorn on to j appointments of aides with hostile views toward from and and and a range of people already skeptical about trump said their doubts were only reinforced by announcements that senior security positions in his administration would be filled with figures like gen t known for his outspoken antipathy toward chose as his national security advisor we must not shy away from comparing his rhetoric to that of the joey a well known said on twitter he echoed the trepidation about general twitter post that of is struggling to understand what ascent means for them and their expressed hope that he will confront militant extremists far more aggressively than the administration has done yet others fear that views and his reliance cabinet appointees who have expressed views will be exploited as a recruiting tool by state operatives and other violent militants suspicions toward and ratifies the said a senior research fellow at the international center for the study of radicalization and political violence at college in are always looking for evidence of this conspiracy against he said general elevation in particular deeply in where modern history has been profoundly shaped by the decisions of officials and citizens alike are weighing harsh words against his promise to defeat terrorism some seemed less offended by comments linking terrorism to than liberals have endured years of being used to justify mass and some see trump as a in calling out or a certain brand of it as the problem say they believe trump will take a harder line on the power that many see as the incubator of the extreme form of that forms a basis of the ideology victory of trump is the beginning of the end of extremist and said an lawmaker and the former national security adviser in vow to defeat terrorism many say they have hope that decisive power will be marshaled to eradicate the the extremist group also known as which has brutalized parts of and and plotted attacks on the west have no concerns about the policy of trump because he is against said the spokesman for prime minister of think we are facing one and that is fighting i do not think there are fears or concerns about a new on spoke by phone with trump for the first and a statement released by the prime office said the two leaders affirmed their cooperation against the state trump told are essential partners to us and you will find strong and deep but invective against during the and his apparent intent to put those feelings into policy with his represented a deep betrayal to the many who worked as translators alongside the military in and have dreamed of immigrating to the united states under a special visa program that will now be in jeopardy six years have i was still hoping to get a call at any moment that would represent the fulfillment of the promise they made to said who worked as an interpreter for the military in province for five years he said seeing trump win the given me a clear image that dream has totally some local leaders in areas of that have known firsthand the brutality expressed alarm that an government seen as virulently would become a rallying cry for recruiters is concern about the policy of trump toward the because is not just any said a member of the provincial council in province is a powerful and we are concerned that any extreme policy toward will help extreme movements by polarizing thousands of the youths and turning them into time bombs by recruiting

the stock turbulent response to the election of j trump first then up presents an interesting was the election result good or bad for right it appears that they have made peace with the prospect of a trump presidency the 500 a index of stocks closed last week 1 5 percent higher than its level but this is a striking reversal from the initial judgment throughout the stocks rose whenever campaign developments made it less likely that trump would be elected consider the four events that shifted the race most dramatically stocks rose sharply after the first presidential one that most people thought trump lost stocks rose again after the release of the video of sexually explicit boasts when the announced that it was looking into a new cache of electoral stock but stocks fell and when the clarified that there nothing new in these stocks rose on the increased prospect of a trump loss each of these market responses suggests that investors believed that stocks would be worth much less under president trump i documented this pattern in a and also in a research paper in which a and i studied these data more carefully we concluded that the market was acting as if it were pricing in a substantial perhaps as large as 12 percent if this was then a surprise trump win should have led stocks to and fall sharply just how sharply depends how much markets had already priced in the possibility of a trump and our best guess was that it would lead stocks to fall by 8 to 10 percent markets followed that script at least at first as the votes were tallied through the it became clear that trump was on track to win the election by the live forecast gave him a better than 95 percent chance of as did traders in political prediction markets as traders in overnight markets responded and stocks plummeted when the decline in 500 futures hit 5 it triggered the circuit breakers at the mercantile exchange foreign stock indexes were also cratering while markets had yet to fall by as much as we had they appeared to be on their way but then an unexpected second act began the futures market and traders who by now had had some time to digest the reality of a trump presidency reversed course over the next four stock futures recovered around of their earlier losses by the time major markets in the united states opened the next morning for regular stocks were almost back to levels stocks rose again on each of the following two days what explains this some commentators have suggested that markets rallied in response to relatively conventional victory speech his emphasis on infrastructure in might have boosted growth expectations but the speech began just before 3 three hours after the market turnaround the speech was simply a rehashing of previously announced policies a major infrastructure push might be good for but hard to believe that what was said at 3 changed the odds of its implementation the size of the stimulus which would most likely be partly countered by a fed tightening is not large enough to explain a major market movement another possibility is that markets were responding to news that republicans looked likely to hold the house and senate but according to the live that was clearly a sure thing by 10 while the market turnaround occurred hours later others have suggested that the market rallied because the election reduced and markets hate uncertainty but this is a case where our casual intuitions can be misleading the election did resolve one but in a way that increased overall uncertainty the markets went from facing the mere possibility that the riskier candidate would be to the certainty that he would be that risk and uncertainty which typically leads stock prices to fall perhaps markets were responding to some other source of good news about the scoured news feeds from election night for other events that might have moved and find anything when conventional explanations time to look for something more unorthodox thinks what happened is analogous to polling error overnight futures markets are populated by a relatively small number of traders who are attempting to predict how the broader market will respond the next day just as polling errors arise when pollsters survey more democrats or republicans than there are in the broader overnight markets can send faulty signals when they reflect more bears or bulls than the broader market in his the market turnaround really gathered steam when the financial markets opened for regular trading at around 2 and it continued with greater force as more of the traders awoke to discover that trump had won and stocks were cheap a story suggesting that worth listening to the signals from overnight because they get it right on average but it also suggests interpreting signals with greater caution than we because an imperfect of broader market sentiment my own view is that last stock market gyrations reflect a more fundamental market failure call it a failure of imagination investors simply failed to imagine how they might feel when they woke up to trump psychologists have documented what they call a focusing illusion the behavioral economist who studies the psychology of has described it as the idea that in life is as important as you think it while you are thinking about in one classic subjects who were asked whether people would be happier in than the focused on the salient differences the winter weather which led them to conclude that were happier perhaps investors made a similar mistake when comparing life in with life in focusing on salient differences such as the temperament of each while ignoring the raft of other factors that would shape their portfolios perhaps the reality of waking up to a new president broke this narrow leading investors to look beyond their narrow to their broader confidence in the strength of

top diplomat in lives in an elegant stone house first built by a missionary in a short walk from the historic old city but he is not an ambassador and the mission is a not an embassy for those distinctions have rankled many the united along with the rest of the has kept its primary diplomatic footprint not in but in the commercial and cultural hub of tel to avoid seeming to take sides in the fraught and argument over who really has the right to control this ancient city until now maybe j trump vowed during his campaign that he would relocate the mission after taking office that in itself is nothing for candidates running for president have promised to move the embassy to and for candidates who actually became president have opted against doing so but just as trump broke all the rules of some of his supporters say no amount of by the state department will change his mind an orthodox lawyer who is advising trump on told army radio after the election that the was to do because he was man who keeps his many and are buzzing about the prospect where would the embassy would it straddle the line between west which is predominantly and east which is predominantly would it touch off street protests in cities or a backlash among allies like and is a emotional and real said a former ambassador to the united states and president of the institute matters to many because it would indicate that the united states actually recognizes as which now it effectively does which is why object so strenuously to such a move is a sign that going to side with said a scholar at the gulf

the united nations recommended that the city be declared a meaning an international rather than incorporated into either the or the states then being contemplated on the land between the river and the sea but in the war that followed its declaration of statehood in captured the western portion of the city while seized the east took control of east in its 1967 war with its neighbors and annexed

to recognize the annexation and kept their embassies in or near tel the last two countries with embassies in and el moved out a decade ago bill and w bush both promised during their presidential campaigns to move the embassy to both later backed away from those convinced by middle east experts that doing so would prejudge negotiations for a final settlement between and in congress passed a law declaring to be capital and requiring the embassy be moved there by 1999 or else the state department building budget would be cut in half but the law included a provision allowing presidents to waive its requirement for six months if they determined it was in the national interest so every six bush and eventually president signed such fearing a violent response in the world if the embassy moved president who reversed his campaign promise did so because he decided not to take the said b a longtime middle east envoy who advised multiple including has historically been an issue that provoked great passions often as a result of false claims that did trigger whether such advice might sway trump is unclear despite another trump adviser on the middle told the that trump would move the embassy he later clarified that he meant a at since no one could imagine a consensus including at this point a former middle east adviser to said trump should follow through because even if east is eventually ceded to the as the capital of their own no plausible settlement would deny west to is simply no reason not to put a embassy he said the issue remains so delicate that the administration went all the way to the supreme court to block a law passed by congress allowing parents of children born in to list as their birthplace on their passports when came to in for the funeral of the former president and prime the white house initially released a transcript of his eulogy that listed as the location of his remarks a few hours it issued a transcript that literally crossed out the

excel because these stocks are traded assets and all traders can contribute to the overall prediction if traders feel stock prices are low relative to future they will bid up if they feel prices are they will sell and drive down prices in this the final price represents a collective prediction by the entire market an increase in stock prices therefore signals an expected increase in future profits the movement in stock prices has a direct shareholders are immediately wealthier anyone holding a retirement portfolio knows the feeling of reading stock price movements through the narrow lens of how well you can retire this does not benefit all people in the economy some shares are held by citizens of other and the shares held in this country are not equitably held but at the a surge in stock prices equals more wealth for the citizenry but rising stock prices can spell good news for other even many of those who do not own stocks can expect a brighter future this is because when companies consumers frequently also do well this notion can be somewhat counterintuitive after we often reflexively assume that when businesses make more they do so at our that by overcharging us in a

is also presumably producing joy for consumers this example also makes clear when the stock market can be a poor scoreboard for the economy sometimes companies can profit without improving or possibly even by worsening them for part of the stock surge after the election most likely occurred because of a widely held belief that a trump administration would slash regulations that may be good for some bottom but is that good for everyone it depends do those regulations hinder only products that were profitable and good for or do they also hinder products that are bad for take the case of wells which was recently found to have created millions of accounts in names without their knowledge these accounts were profitable for wells but surely not good for consumers the extent of this behavior was uncovered because of the work of a regulatory the consumer financial protection bureau election increases the possibility that the bureau will be shut down or that its powers will be curtailed but if this prospect raises the value of bank stocks because it makes it more likely that behavior like wells can hardly cause for celebration and not good news for the economy in whether a rise in stock prices is good or bad for depends on whether the increase in profits arises because companies are serving consumers or because they are profiting at expense there is a final factor to the capacity of

run for president as an independent as they sought an alternative to trump while he was receptive to the he ultimately decided against running thoughtfulness and patriotism and for that the modesty showed as he reflected on this decision make me more convinced than ever that he would have made a truly admirable and also a good the editor of the conservative weekly wrote at the time general is widely respected in the military community and could bring with him a staff of civilian experts he was the head of the united states central which oversees all military operations in the middle from 2010 to 2013 but crossed swords with president over his push for a more aggressive presence in the gulf under federal a former military official must be out of uniform for seven years to become

as chairman of the democratic senatorial campaign committee for the 2018 cycle van was our first choice for chairman because of his his work ethic and his said in a statement map is tough for but i have no doubt that van is up to the tough democrats gained a mere two senate seats on election day new and and will be defending a daunting 23 seats in as well as two held by independents who caucus with them king of and sanders of and roughly half of those states were won by trump in democrats have one real senator dean heller of and maybe two with flake of if things go south for the new

barring some unexpected none of the refugees held in detention camps on the pacific islands of and are likely to be resettled in the united states before j trump takes and officials said this week the election of whose harsh talk about immigration and was central to his leaves in doubt the deal the two countries recently struck to move some of the hundreds of people who were banished to the camps by after being intercepted at sea trying to reach its shores many of the detainees are the issue is a contentious and emotional one in whose government has pledged never to accept a migrant who tries to come to the country by boat the stated purpose of the pacific in which such people are housed indefinitely on offshore is to discourage human who often pack migrants into rickety boats for the some of which have ended in mass drownings but conditions on those islands are dire on a united nations envoy visiting said that daily life for detainees on was inhumane and degrading human rights groups have reached similar conclusions about conditions on both islands the government said that it had reached a agreement in which the united states would take in hundreds of the detainees but just days after the announcement of the an secretary of the immigration told an senate panel that it seemed unlikely that any detainees would be resettled by inauguration day in the united states on in a written response to the united states state department said that the screening process to determine whether refugees were eligible to enter the united states was taking as long as 18 to 24 months to complete safety and security of the people is our top the state department said it said refugees were subject to the highest level of security checks of any category of traveler to the united involving the department of homeland the national center and the trump has not commented on the deal as a presidential he called for a temporary ban on all though his campaign later said that the ban would apply only to migrants from one of his mark executive director of the center for immigration which favors more restrictive immigration was quoted in news reports as saying that the deal was likely to be on once trump took office the united nations said on that conditions for detainees on were grim health issues are with stress anxiety and depression being among the most common said at a news conference in the describing what he found on a recent visit to refugees and asylum seekers are on a constant diet of sleeping tablets and children suffered from nightmares and he said said policy was punitive sends a message to the people he said to me this is not a justification to mandatory detention is a violation of human rights the united nations has endorsed the plan to send about 1 , 600 detainees to the united states the camps were opened in 2012 island is holding 823 men about 410 women and mostly in family are held on and would be given the first option to resettle in the united states under the new agreement about 400 others in seeking some medical treatment must return to or island before applying to go to the united states only those who have been granted refugee status by the united nations will be eligible to go to the united the government has said prime minister of and the state department have said the deal would not affect the total number of refugees accepted by the united states each year said the deal was the result of months of but he offered little reassurance that it would be honored under trump deal with one administration at a said similar concerns were raised during the hearing on one asked the immigration whether the government was sure that the deal would be given negative statements about refugees and about 10 percent of the detainees are from while others are from and have an agreement struck between the two governments should other contingencies or other eventualities that is a matter that the government will have to deal with at that said
it was a golden year for w a mad dash that would take him to 11 countries on four and by the time 2006 was earn him million a princely sum compared with the he claimed to have in when he went through a divorce with salaries from a law firm and a consulting and most of all million from 108 speeches he delivered to audiences around the the lucrative year of 2006 will along with the rest of career

often related to business deals he was or even standing agreements he had like one with backers of the dissident political party known as the which until 2012 was considered a foreign terrorist organization by the state department they offer a road map of sorts to the kinds of potential conflict of interest questions that are already emerging as name is floated as a possible trump cabinet particularly given that trump repeatedly mocked his democratic for the many speeches she and her husband gave after they left public office she she made million giving speeches to wall street banks and other special interests in less than two years secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the trump said in she and bill made million giving speeches to and foreign governments in the

rules about keeping his remarks as a contract to which organizations that invited him to speak had to agree makes clear stipulated that his remarks could not be nor could press or other media of the remarks be allowed without his explicit permission he also had some elaborate including that if he traveled by private it be a iv or a plane that costs about for a trip within the united states some members of the which will hold hearings and vote on his nomination if trump selects are already saying they want to learn more about work in the years since he left city hall concerned generally about conflicts of interest on the part of prospective members of the in every senator democrat of said when asked about business ventures since he left office that concern is well justified in terms of the backgrounds of some of the potential nominees that have been in an interview this defended his activities since he left saying he had been open about his dealings with private companies and foreign

j trump embarked on one of the rituals of the presidency on meeting in new with the prime minister of as he continued his fitful adjustment to the protocols of diplomacy am convinced trump is a leader in whom i can have great said after the meeting at trump tower he described the encounter as the visit with came after 32 congratulatory phone calls from foreign leaders in the nine days since trump won the election none seem to have adhered to established diplomatic in which the state department choreographs the sequence of the calls and provides policy guidance and translating services on the

routed through the state as is according to a department official aides did not respond to questions about whether the had used his own interpreter in the meeting with and calls with other or whether

couple of general said in a telephone interview by how personable he and by his intellectual curiosity about national security events most presidential candidates have an knowledge of national security issues but he asked excellent general declined to discuss the advice he had given trump but he said the new greatest challenge would be to maintain leadership in a world in which radical militancy was threatening to metastasize into a and hostile powers like china and were seeking regional dominance during the trump called into question the network of security alliances that the united states had maintained since world war saying the partners in and were not paying their fair share for the umbrella of protection few allies were as rattled by campaign statements as japan at one he suggested that japan and south consider acquiring nuclear weapons to protect themselves in the days leading to officials from the foreign and trade ministries were urging to take a tough line with trump on the value of the partnership a huge trade deal that trump opposes and the defense which trump has said japan must contribute more money according to j a former official in the bush administration with close ties to japan but appeared to reject that preferring to focus on cultivating a personal relationship with trump some japan experts speculated that was concerned about getting off on the right foot with trump because when the leader traveled to new in for the united nations general assembly he met with who was then the favorite in the presidential but not trump prime minister has done very well with strongmen like and said referring to prime minister of and the president question the side still cannot understand is what a trump administration will actually do on

interesting juxtaposition of the the show announces that the current season will be its and who creates fake news stories on the tells the sites were picked up by trump supporters all the time i think trump is in the white house because of the reality show about the family of and its became a spectacular hit for after its debut in march then a spectacular headache in late 2013 when the made remarks in a interview that were widely seen as offensive to gay people at that point the show was averaging nine million viewers a an amazing number for a reality but the controversy cost it cachet among some and ratings have fallen considerably since overexposure no doubt also played a role in the decline members of the clan became celebrities and started turning up all over the and the producers churned out too many episodes too quickly even viewers who still loved the and their homespun antics may have been tiring of the whole premise during season 11 the family announced that the series would end with the finale in bother making a joke about the shelving the series so they could join j administration social media was flooded with them by morning that could happen there are certainly enough to fill every cabinet and the central was a supporter of trump but this is more likely just an example of a show that has run out of gas not without leaving a however the series helped solidify the idea that distinguishing between real and truth and really important i spent a day with the in west in the summer of between the first and second seasons the series was still building but even at that early the readily acknowledged that their real at all hardly rare most reality shows are staged or at least steered toward a preplanned of course but the were unusual in that they freely admitted it is the phrase they used the episodes simply follow the around in their daily the producers would often sketch out the parameters of a situation and have the family live it what made the show work so well was that the fitting the eastern image of were in fact savvy media excellent improvisers and telegenic as heck and they seemed to intuit that although many of the episodes were obvious no one would care sensed that viewers would happily embrace the reality that they even if it was a manipulated or outright invented version of reality and in we have seen this flexible definition of real carry into the political arena as horner fabricated news articles streamed into receptive minds through feeds and such were a worrisome phenomenon in the presidential and they continue to be being called this was named oxford 2016 international word of the politicians have only recently figured out how to exploit it the and other dynasties have been doing it for years
on the is a clumsily made attack on the coal industry in west but it benefits considerably from the events of the past two weeks the film jumps around chronologically and thematically in a way that dilutes its but it still provides plenty of cause to question the wisdom of j stated intentions of reviving coal mining and reducing environmental and other regulations the by and traces the unpleasant history of coal in west including obvious black marks like the 2010 explosion at a energy company in which 29 people and less obvious ones like vanishing pension and health care benefits coal companies have carried out a sort of mass the film using their status as the only significant employer around to generate support even among the workers they are exploiting and exposing to hazardous conditions most interesting in light of campaign pledge to increase the number of coal industry jobs is a segment that suggests expanded coal production would not generate a significant number of jobs because mining methods now in use are not as labor intensive as underground mining was the industry also has a long legacy of environmental even with federal regulation a lawyer who has represented clients suing coal uses a war analogy war is the one that coal has waged on west for the last 150 he says as the camera pans a desolate landscape believe a you go find a battleground as and scarred as the mountaintops of southern west you go find a place where more explosives are set off in a month anywhere on the film may be but if nothing it is a reminder that the equals equation is a serious oversimplification

committed to the security guarantees that have underpinned system of collective defense and peace in since 1949 but the states remain on trump demonstrated a mercurial streak during the and they are

how trump could unify a bitterly divided provide jobs to many of the millions of disaffected workers who voted for and lift the stock market and tax rolls all he needs to do is what he presumably does build something and i mean a few miles of asphalt or a paint job on a rusting bridge build something something can be proud of something that will repay the investment many times over for generations to come build the equivalent of the golden gate the the tunnel or the timberline lodge or given passion for the another state park black course the first public golf course to host the prestigious united states open all of these are public works projects that are still in use can anyone name even one infrastructure project from president billion recovery and reinvestment i think so in fairness to republicans in congress bitterly opposed his public works spending and he lamented there were too few projects that stop franklin his public works administration and works progress using combinations of public and private solicited proposals from states and hired millions of workers and eventually built 78 , 000 650 , 000 miles of 700 miles of airport 13 , 000 playgrounds and 125 ,

sociology professor at state university and author of the books solving the economic crisis through civic and extreme but not so much the numbers people remember today people just know there was an alphabet soup of he said they see and remember are the the bay national airport or the baseball stadium in living on that legacy repealing lowering taxes for businesses and mostly wealthy overhauling the immigration system and privatizing what congressional republicans have cited as their top legislative priorities would be divisive in a nation bitterly split along partisan and geographic lines but nearly everyone agrees that has grossly neglected its infrastructure even as the rest of the notably has raced ahead airports are like from a trump said at university during the first presidential debate land at la you land at you land at you land at and you come in from and and you see these incredible you come in from you see these incredible and you land become a who could also called for a big increase in infrastructure spending single best thing the federal government can do to promote economic growth is to repair and build the transportation the railroads and said roger an emeritus

has pledged trillion over 10 but no one i spoke to thought that was enough doubling that would be more said and campaign proposal was limited to infrastructure projects that could pay for themselves out of user which seems like a shortsighted approach most economists say the best way to finance a big public works particularly given low interest would be for the government to borrow most of the money from investors pulling off something on the scale of the public works programs would be no small feat recent federal infrastructure including reconstruction after hurricanes and as well as the stimulus hardly inspire confidence a professor of history at said he doubted trump could replicate achievements had a coherent if not always a consistent way to address the depression and the economic

campaign promises are easy governing is hard it is a truism that j trump and his team will soon learn and a fascinating example has emerged since the courtesy of global currency markets it is a study in the kind of complex that trump rarely grappled with during his campaign but will face many times a day in the oval office a centerpiece of campaign was the united trade deficits he pledged to eliminate them and create a resurgence in manufacturing he has also pledged tax infrastructure spending and deregulation that set of policies has led markets to expect speedier economic growth and thus higher interest rates in coming years in is driving the value of the dollar higher since election the dollar is up 3 6 percent against an index of six other major currencies the value of the peso has fallen 11 percent against the a remarkable swing for the united trading partner you need to be an economist to see what that a pricier dollar makes it harder for manufacturers to compete it gives an advantage to companies that locate operations and it all else being tend to make the trade deficit higher rather than lower this is not to suggest that the shift in the currency so far is a major disaster for manufacturers and other exporters those that ship their goods to will feel the brunt of there was a bigger rise in the dollar in 2014 and 2015 that damaged export sectors even more but imagine that trump follows through on the policy mix hinted at so a combination of loose fiscal policy more spending on defense and and tax and tighter monetary policy federal reserve raising interest rates faster than had seemed likely before the at that the dollar could move decisively creating a tension that the president and his advisers would have to resolve one way or the other as a rule of said a senior fellow at the institute for international a 10 percent rise in the dollar would be expected to increase the current account deficit broader concept than trade but closely by 1 to 1 5 percent of in the ensuing two to three years in that pledge to eliminate the billion united states trade deficit would have just become billion to billion harder this is the kind of dilemma presidents face all the time the oval office debate might go something like the commerce secretary this strong dollar is just killing our they compete with this kind of the treasury who is in charge of the a necessary our economy is booming so much that global investors just get enough of united states when there are these kinds of the president has to decide and when a president tries to find a solution that answers both there are always complex ripples for appoint fed officials who will cut interest might temporarily let you have both a booming domestic economy and a competitive export but would mean an increase in inflation which will make both the bond market and many retired living on fixed incomes unhappy the tension between currency policy and trade policy is just one example promises to repeal while keeping some of its most popular features would be hard to carry out in practice virtually every issue in tax diplomacy and regulatory policy features similar complex none of this is to say that these tensions are or that trump overcome his lack of a policy background to arrive at good solutions but he will almost certainly find out that great is a not an answer
millions of suffer from alcoholism or addiction to legal and illegal but only a fraction are being according to a report released on by the surgeon general one in seven people in the united states is expected to develop a substance use disorder at some the report said but as of only one in 10 will receive treatment the report is the first from a surgeon general to address substance use disorders and the wider range of health problems related to alcohol and drugs it calls among other a cultural change in understanding that addiction is a brain not a character flaw time to change how we view h the surgeon said in releasing the report as a moral failing but as a chronic illness that must be treated with urgency and compassion the way we address this crisis is a test for the report is intended to try to prompt the policy makers and health care professionals to better address these issues those who work in the fields of addiction and recovery liken it to the landmark surgeon general reports of the and that said smoking caused lung cancer and led congress in 1965 to require health warnings on cigarette packs but it is not clear that this report will be nearly as influential for at least one senator is calling it a deaths caused by prescription heroin and overdoses are growing exponentially every yet this report fails to provide any detailed road map for how best to curb opioid senator j democrat of said in a statement the magnitude of the opioid he a far more detailed in the report comes at the tail end of the which pleaded unsuccessfully with congress this year for billion to fight the opioid epidemic congress instead set aside a move that a disappointed president said was better than nothing and it comes as the incoming j prepares to appoint his own surgeon general and has his own ideas about how to combat the epidemic trump has said that he will everything we to get to but his chief proposal is to build a wall on the border with the he said in new last would keep out drug dealers and keep out heroin poisoning our even if a wall kept some heroin out of the united it would not necessarily solve the problem while many are dying of overdoses of many more are dying from opioid painkillers legally prescribed within the united states and in some deaths from synthetic like which are coming from are overtaking deaths from heroin on a conference was asked how plans to roll back the affordable care act might affect his call to action on substance abuse issue of addiction affects everyone regardless of political ethnicity or socioeconomic he adding that the effort to combat the drug epidemic has been bipartisan urgency to address addiction is only said he vowed to continue his work to how talking about addiction and get people to step forward and ask for the new report said that 78 people die every day in the united states from opioid a number that has nearly quadrupled since 1999 it estimated that the annual economic toll related to alcohol is billion and that the toll related to drugs is billion the majority of people who misuse substances do not develop a use the report said but roughly one in seven 14 6 percent of the population are expected to develop such a disorder at some point only about 10 percent of people with a substance use disorder receive any type of specialty the report said and while more than 40 percent of people with such a disorder also have a mental health fewer than half receive treatment for either from 40 percent to 70 percent of a risk for developing a substance use disorder is the report but many environmental factors like how old he or she is when first drinking or trying drugs can influence the risk people who first drink alcohol before age 15 are four times more likely to become addicted at some time in their lives than are those who have their first drink at age 20 or the report said nearly 70 percent of those who try an illicit drug before the age of 13 develop a substance use disorder within seven the report compared with 27 percent of those who first try an illicit drug after the age of 17
j victory could well push the party system toward a clash between an overwhelmingly white ethnic party and a cosmopolitan coalition of minority groups and whites despite the unexpected trump lost the popular vote in an election that in some respects closely resembled victory over mitt in 2012 an ordinary end to a very abnormal campaign the power of party identification held approximately 90 percent of republicans in camp campaign may set in motion a process that reorients politics toward the cosmopolitanism versus nationalism divide that he reconfiguring our party system and shaping our politics for decades to come the power of social identity suggests that such a dynamic could be difficult to stop once set in motion in recent the democrats and republicans have battled along a axis of conflict that emphasizes disagreement over the size and scope of government rather than divisive disputes about racial identity during the 2008 and 2012 presidential for john and ran against domestic policy proposals on issues like health care and the economy after the republican party hoped to continue along this path and expand its appeal to young minorities and women but as the political scientists miller and norm candidates and parties sometimes in flanking moves so as to enlist coalitions of disaffected by changing positions on social issues that cut across party they seek to attract voters who are only loosely attached to the other party trump seems to have pulled off one of these maneuvers in shifting from traditional conservatism to a kind of nationalism though the move cost him votes among he attracted support among the larger group of whites without a college degree substantial minority of whom had backed in pulling in just enough votes in the rust belt to tip the election despite all the attention paid to economic anxiety as the basis for the evidence to date is more consistent with his brand of identity politics being the most important cause of this shift in voting patterns from 2012 of course economic anxiety and group animus are not mutually approach has the potential to transform the party system the success of his campaign may encourage other republicans to adopt his model he has shown that the penalty for deviating from orthodox policies is minimal and that an style can have significant electoral advantages though presidents cannot impose their will on most of domestic they can help define the issues on the political agenda in the choices that he trump may play down conflict over the size and scope of government and shift the political debate toward questions of national immigration and culture few republicans are likely to want to cross trump and his energized supporters given the threat of a potential primary challenge in 2018 for decision to name as his chief strategist the head of a website described in an article in the conservative national review as catering to small but vocal fringe of white and though the move lacked recent no republicans in congress which made the issue into a partisan dispute with democrats trump has also stirred emotions by promising to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants by the fate of a tax cut normally the top domestic policy priority has received less attention the party will almost certainly pursue success is likely to provoke a response from democrats that could accelerate this shift they face an outraged liberal base that is likely to reject conciliatory messages intended to win back votes among the white working class the party might instead double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and white voters who were the main target of campaign the strategy failed in but the incentive to try again is clear democrats came closer to winning several sun belt states where minority and white populations are like and than they did some traditional strongholds with higher numbers of like and a focus on cosmopolitanism might make electoral sense for democrats given the changing demographics of the but it could further weaken their appeal to whites without college dividing the electorate by race and class even more nothing about this process is of course republicans may yet succeed in steering trump toward a traditional agenda of tax cuts and deregulation but the effects he could have on party system could be of far more lasting consequence than almost any policy he might propose

lurking behind the turmoil and the jockeying for advantage in j effort to assemble a national security team lies the more fundamental question of how he will address the immediate and complex challenges he inherits upon taking office trump has never articulated any detailed foreign policy vision beyond the vague slogan the diverse and shifting cast of potential appointees under consideration for top administration jobs has only highlighted the deep splits among conservatives about how the new administration should confront threats involving north and among and how it should manage relations with allies in and trump said in a march interview with the new describing for the first time what the phrase meant to him have been mocked and ripped off for many years by people that were from his personnel appointments to his first major meeting with a foreign leader it came in new with prime minister of japan trump faces a series of decisions that will begin to flesh out his approach to the world and provide some clue as to how he might respond to whatever crises confront him as commander in chief does mean he will use military and to wipe out emerging from rogue nuclear states to terrorist before they can do harm to the united or does it mean he calls troops back building them into a retaliatory force that can lash out if the nation is at moments during the he suggested both approaches he said he would the from areas of and he criticized president for pulling troops out too soon but he is also the man who rejected and is it always the united states that gets right in the middle of he some we cannot be the policeman of the no one knows what response to expect from a man who said he prided himself on following his instincts and has little patience for careful legalisms of his predecessor but while presidents the challenges do not here are some places and issues where will first take trump called the agreement reached with in intended to constrain from building nuclear of the most incompetent deals of any kind ever and he promised to fix it because the deal is an executive not a the new president has great latitude to alter or scrap it but two can play that the are deeply unhappy with the arguing that they never got the relief from sanctions that they were promised any effort to reopen the bargaining will also give military officers and conservatives a chance to alter the pact or threaten to resume their race for nuclear capability to the deal was not only but also badly negotiated he said of secretary of state john and his negotiating team trump said he would have left the negotiating doubled down on and never agreed to give back billions of money that belonged to and was frozen in financial institutions but when he struggled to name any part of the deal he would have walked out of the negotiations to alter with some he finally settled on a common that after 15 will be free to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium in any quantity in decision about what to do with the deal will be an early test of his willingness to act unilaterally the nations that joined the united states in the negotiations and china not only support the but are rushing to take economic advantage of it by building commercial ties with if trump wanted to abandon the deal or reimpose they would almost certainly refuse to go along the hold a few too in they shipped 98 percent of their nuclear fuel out of the disabled a plutonium reactor and took thousands of which enrich out of service if the deal were to be declared they would be free to their nuclear infrastructure and rebuild their now frozen until 2030 by administration it would take about a year for them to produce enough new material for a weapon longer to produce the weapon itself one option for advocated by many is to simply reimpose sanctions on for including its activities in and its continued support of terrorism the would say that violates the spirit of the agreement and leadership has already threatened that such action would nullify it it is hard to say which has sounded more confrontational in recent years about north the which has regularly warned of a to any north use of its expanding nuclear or the who spent much of the bush years plotting ways to make the regime collapse but if there is likely to be an early test of reaction to north is probably it the nation has accelerated its nuclear and its arsenal is it could have 20 to 50 weapons during term in his security trump will be hearing the latest estimates for how long it will take the north to build a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the public figure is five years or though some intelligence officials believe it could happen significantly sooner trump has at various times described north young as even while expressing grudging admiration for toughness so the early choice will be should trump confront the north with more missile defenses and perhaps a naval blockade to stop all trade that does not go across the perhaps that is what trump meant when he said that should use our economic power to have them should he reopen negotiations with a nation that has made clear that its nuclear arsenal is perhaps that is what trump was suggesting when he said he was willing to meet one on one with over a hamburger as yet another should he pull back forces in the pacific and let the and the deal with the he suggested just that in a interview with the new saying that if countries did not pay their fair share for he was prepared to tell you will be defending trump made before and after the
congress should exercise greater scrutiny over trade and investment practices between the united states and china in order to prevent china from taking advantage of the economic a congressional commission said in a report released on in its long list of the commission advised congress to authorize a government panel that reviews foreign takeover deals to bar companies from acquiring or gaining of companies it also said congress should ask a government watchdog agency to write a report on whether outsourcing of manufacturing to china leading to the hollowing out of the defense industrial in the commission suggested ways in which congress could better bring cases against china each the economic and security review commission releases a report to congress with recommendations based on months of research the commission aims to make suggestions after examining investment and national security issues between the two nations its recommendations are not binding the report this year took a critical look at the relationship between the united states and china for implying that the countries are not competing on a level playing field it follows a populist airing of grievances over the downsides of free trade and a economy in western nations this year that helped lead to the election last week of j trump as the next united states president and to the vote by in to leave the union in its recent public has emphasized the tight economic ties between the two major trading partners and said the countries would benefit more from working together during his trump said he would bring manufacturing jobs back to middle and consider imposing a 45 percent tariff on as well as labeling china a currency manipulator some economists have said a trade war with china would harm the united states economy and lead to a recession in after prodding from some the government accountability a watchdog said that it would examine whether reviews of foreign purchases should include a stricter look at more types of foreign investments and be broadened to define more industries as important to the economy the review process is done by the committee on foreign investment in the united or which approves most of the foreign purchases that it examines the report released on said it is that panel that congress should authorize to reject purchases by enterprises such companies are the main drivers of economy the new report said congress should also create an office in the international trade administration to identify and bring and countervailing duty cases countervailing duties are imposed on goods to offset the fact that the goods may have been made with the help of subsidies besides trade and the report covers topics like security global footprint and the united to in one the authors criticize what they see as meager government efforts to block intelligence collection by china the administration has expressed concern over what it sees as hacking from china in recent years government response to the threat from intelligence collection has suffered from the lack of an coordinated effort within the intelligence the report said efforts to counter intelligence collection operations have manifested largely as a series of espionage prosecutions rather than a it added administration has taken steps to improve among government agencies and defense but these measures could not the significant threats to these
prime minister of japan is planning to sit down with j trump in new on in what would be the first meeting with a foreign leader since his election wants to find out how serious trump was during his campaign when he repeatedly criticized japan on trade issues and for not paying more of the cost of its own defense and since the establishment was expecting to win the wants to assure trump that he is willing and eager to work with him the prime minister is concerned about commitment to protecting japan the united states is most important and is legally obligated to defend it against attack there are around 50 , 000 troops stationed in a powerful deterrent against the rising threat of north and an increasingly assertive china during the trump suggested he might withdraw troops not without resistance from members of officials at the state diplomats and military advisers the united alliance has been in place since the end of world war and has a lot of backing on both sides of the pacific ocean maybe there are signs that japan might be willing to pay or do but many experts contend troops are not only defending japan but the united own interests in the pentagon is budgeted to spend about billion to support troops and bases on and elsewhere around japan this year japan is set to spend billion to support the in addition to at least billion on related including compensation for the communities that host the bases and funds for relocating troops under its which was written by occupying forces after world war japan can keep an army for defensive purposes but has said he wants to revise the constitution and expand the military in his government requested the latest in a series of increases in military spending japan has committed to the nuclear nonproliferation and will probably remind trump of that on the campaign trump decried the cost of providing a nuclear umbrella to allies such as japan and south that do not have their own nuclear arms in trump told the new times that he was open to those countries building their own nuclear but on twitter this week he denied having said so has reaffirmed his commitment not to develop atomic weapons any move to do so would face severe public opposition in the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack he has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the partnership or as it is known though japan was the last of a dozen pacific rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact trump repeatedly criticized the during the presidential campaign made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to close the deal and get manufacturers access to export markets in the united states and elsewhere the trade partnership could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as a counterweight to the superpower acknowledged after victory that the partnership was in a difficult but his government still plans to have parliament ratify the and he has not given up on selling it to trump may also seek to soften angry campaign in which he accused japan of crushing the united states on and manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage trump says for free trade in but wants a for the united states what that for remains a mystery

in a justice department prosecutor from stopped by to see the united states attorney in at the time the j said he had heard a shocking a federal judge had called a prominent white lawyer disgrace to his for representing black clients sessions according to he in testimony before congress in and others painted an unflattering portrait of who would go on to become a senator from and according to numerous sources close to j transition is a potential nominee for attorney general or secretary of defense testified that sessions had referred to the civil liberties union and the as for to force civil rights down the throats of one prosecutor testified that sessions had called him and joked that he thought that the until i found out they smoked sessions denied calling the lawyer but acknowledged or did not dispute the substance of the other remarks the bitter testimony sank his nomination by president to be a federal district court judge and foreshadowed the questions that sessions could face at another set of senate confirmation hearings if trump nominates him for a cabinet position after nearly 20 years in the now has more allies and would face a clearer road to confirmation than he did as a young judicial nominee and as the first senator to endorse presidential he has a special status as an early supporter who became an important surrogate and close adviser but for trump a sessions nomination to a critical position at the justice or defense department still presents risks trump faced criticism over his derogatory remarks about and his support from racist groups throughout his and for his appointment of a nationalist media executive to a top white house position since his election a sessions nomination raises the possibility that a trump administration will open with racially charged hearings a spokesman for sessions did not respond to a request for comment but on senator a south republican who opposed enthusiastically endorsed sessions for a major job in the trump administration think sessions has earned the right to serve trump in the highest he told reporters as attorney sessions would be responsible for upholding civil rights laws as secretary of he would oversee one of the most ethnically diverse institutions in the 25 percent of the military is or as one of the most conservative members of the sessions has been a reliable voice for strict immigration reduced spending and measures he is generally well liked among colleagues in both and took a political risk endorsing trump shortly after the south primary his views on immigration and trade are aligned with the message that trump conveyed during the race sessions has frequently traveled with trump and was said at one point to be under consideration as the nominee sessions has long considered it a personal triumph that he was elected to the senate and became a member of the judiciary committee after that same panel rejected his nomination to the bench two republicans joined democrats in opposing his nomination one of those senator specter of later said his vote had been a mistake a fact that sessions likes to point out but 1986 hearings were unusually both for the era and for the position he was seeking the sessions stretched for hours as justice department officials were called to testify about their views on race sessions said his comment about the was meant as a joke and said it was so preposterous especially since he was in the middle of prosecuting a case involving the group that he thought nobody could take it seriously he was less clear about his remarks about civil rights groups asked whether he ever said the hates white people or was commie group and a pinko sessions said he could not recall specifically saying that am loose with my tongue on and i may have said something similar to that or could be interpreted to he testified he went on to praise the for its work for racial equality in the south he said he never called the group or the but said that they take positions that are considered they hurt they lose credibility and many people do think that some of those positions they take are against the national interests of the united he said he was referring to liberal immigration policies and support for the socialist government in at the justice department lawyers regard officials as partners in the fight for equal rights alone do not guarantee eradicate hate or advance the top civil rights told the group in do people like you do organizations like the the also played a key role in fighting to integrate the military the percentage of in the military now 17 percent has grown steadily since president harry s signed an order in 1948 that ended segregation in the armed forces sessions also did not dispute recollection of their conversation about the white lawyer he said he remembered the but not precisely what he said guess i will not disagree with sessions i do not know why i cannot imagine why i would make that an h testified that sessions referred to him as after an argument with a sessions admonished me to careful what you say to white figures testified sessions denied saying that and was adamant that he had never called figures sessions had his including an d have watched this young man since he started practicing law in judge wrote is fair and compassionate for all his fellow in a phone interview on said it was a that sessions might lead the justice department as for the he racial insensitivity might not be as manifest in such a but i feel good about it if i were a black

heart of whether violated united states law governing foreign became a focal point of the investigation and the ensuing settlement negotiations the bank argued that the hiring of employees was routine

the people briefed on the matter said the people formalized the hiring into what it called the sons and daughters program the bank even went so far as to create spreadsheets that tracked its hires to specific clients and the ability to convert these hires into business deals in reaching the is expected to accept the findings and conclusions of the investigators a spokesman for declined to as did a spokesman for the justice criminal division in and the united states office in the securities and exchange commission and the federal which handled the civil regulatory aspects of the declined to

article in the times three years it added to a growing list of regulatory including the billion trading scandal and a billion settlement with the justice department over the sale of mortgage securities in the years before the 2008 financial crisis the china settlement will now put to rest one of the last big regulatory headaches for the bank some of the senior bankers suspected of carrying out the hiring have since left just as the agreement signals the final chapter in the pursuit of wrongdoing on wall street that effort garnered settlements and splashy but no criminal prosecutions of top wall street executives after the financial crisis an absence that has drawn much criticism and public debate the foreign bribery case against is no different the united states office in and the justice criminal division in are expected to impose a roughly million penalty on the bank but will not charge any of the bankers who doled out the jobs the will assess the largest

negotiated a rare agreement j surprise victory in the presidential election last week could disrupt the public perception that banks are treated leniently a media executive appointed as chief white house lamented in 2014 that one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank associated with the 2008 crisis presidency also could be a turning point in how banks and other corporations do business in china on the campaign trump called china a and threatened to impose tariffs on but as he has shifted his tone and promised that the two nations would have of the strongest no matter the relationship going the justice department is expected to continue enforcing the foreign corrupt practices act the 1977 law that underpins the case against and that might mean more cases against big banks operating in china the case would represent one of the first major crackdowns on a big bank for violations of this but and other banks have also hinted that they face investigations into their hiring practices in china those investigations may but the case provides a template for prosecutors and regulators to bring these sorts of which once seemed lawyers urged prosecutors not to

wall street banks are still too big to and the hundreds of thousands of pages of regulations created in the eight years since the crisis are not adequate protection against another financial says of the federal reserve bank of a republican who has run the fed for about a delivered an unusually blunt and sweeping indictment of financial regulation in a speech before the economic club of new on comparing banking to the nuclear power said regulators needed to take even more drastic steps to bolster capital levels at the big banks because the risk of another financial calamity outweighed the costs of increased regulation if it had come even a few weeks proposal might have been seen as a provocative but ultimately fruitless idea the stuff that makes for a lively discussion of financial regulation over coffee and scrambled eggs in a upper east side but one that goes nowhere in the real world but is introducing his idea in a political abyss of where even the most banking lobbyists admit they have little idea what policies j trump will ultimately adopt trump has vowed to dismantle the 2010 overhaul of banking regulation but has provided few details on what regulations would replace it is waiting and watching to see what he said chief executive of the financial services in an interview on republicans blame the law which created the consumer financial protection among other measures for restricting lending and for hampering economic growth but at the same the republican party platform calls for breaking up the large banks by restoring the new which required a separation of investment from commercial banking proposal called the plan would most likely pressure banks to break apart because the high cost of holding so much capital would mean it would no longer make sense to stay so large such a breakup has not happened naturally since the financial crisis while some big banks have gotten a great deal of lending and activity is still concentrated in hands of a few wall street banks and with that continued concentration comes risk of another he said by the financial regulation since 2008 has reduced the chances of another government banking bailout to only 67 percent from 84 percent before the crisis his proposal would reduce that risk to 9 he by requiring banks to hold much more capital than the current levels want people to have a false sense of security that we have solved said during the breakfast discussion on in reaching his conclusion about the chances of future banking analyzed data from the international monetary fund on previous banking bailouts and capitalization levels of different banking systems he acknowledged that this was an many in the banking industry dismissed the plan as a nonstarter those looking to accelerate economic growth and job tripling bank capital levels already double from levels will make it much harder to meet those a spokeswoman for the financial services a trade said in a statement about proposal later on in representative republican from who is chairman of the house financial services said he had been in constant with the team handing the transition about his plan to overhaul choice act would revamp the oversight of the consumer protection agency and impose harder penalties on bankers who break the law republicans say the bill would free lending from onerous and arbitrary rules and would spur economic growth something that appears to be an overarching goal for the on the plan would seem to be a tough sell to the coming trump administration he calculates that requiring banks to boost their capital to truly safe levels would carry steep economic costs added safety said the total cost of plan would equal 41 percent of gross domestic product though much lower than the economic costs of a financial crisis at the very said his plan was a straightforward attempt at measuring whether the financial legislation has made the banking system safer and his conclusion is it is not quite safe despite assurances from the industry and its regulators that the banking system has never been better capitalized he said the plan would require mega banks with billion or more in assets to issue common equity of 23 5 up from 13 percent required under current rules he would also not allow them to count debt as part of that cushion because he said history showed it was not a foolproof buffer to losses a former banker who ran for governor in in said he had not been contacted by the trump transition team about his plan is known for grabbing the spotlight with unusual ideas he spent time on the streets of posing as a homeless person during his run for governor he said that congress and the administration were not willing to truly end big to because they feared that the economy was too unstable in the immediate aftermath of the crisis during the mortgage banks like and bank of needed billions of dollars of rescue money from taxpayers because they did not have enough capital to cover enormous losses at the was working in the treasury department and was an architect of that helping to develop the troubled asset relief or tarp said he traced some of the current political anger and polarization to how the government responded to the financial crisis which allowed large banks to survive while thousands of struggled to keep their homes and find new jobs bailouts violated a core belief that has been handed down from generation to generation in our society that if you take a risk you bear the rewards and consequences of that he said had to tear that up during the crisis because the biggest banks were going to fail and bring down the economy and when you violate the core beliefs of society it does lead to anger and a feeling that this
over the past president v of has received two starkly different messages about hacking into computer networks from the current and future presidents of the united you and not even sure it was you the white house confirmed in a statement on that eight days before the presidential the united states the government directly regarding malicious that was state it sent the message over a rarely used a connecting the nuclear risk reduction centers in both which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major the warning only the latest after verbal cautions by president his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by the post the warnings to against further hacking into polling or registration or any further effort to affect the outcome of the are being hailed by the administration as a success in deterrence after they a year and a half of hacking activity seemed to or and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on election day but more than a few experts in deterring take a more skeptical view they say the had already achieved their main to demonstrate how they could disrupt the electoral process with the leak of hacked including from the democratic national committee and campaign john d suffered nothing worse than a they note no no counter no embarrassing revelations engineered by the united states and he now has the satisfaction of dealing with j who during the campaign praised promised to build a more productive relationship with and maintained there was no evidence that the were behind the hacking anything wrong happens they like blame the trump said in an 10 debate with know if the doing the hacking maybe there is no trump contended that the allegations of activity were intended to for advocating a new relationship with he frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the suggesting the hacking was a fabrication the leaks of emails worked largely to his embarrassing democratic leaders like representative of who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the democratic national committee larger strategic message is that the united states and need to cooperate on a range of issues but for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of foreign policy and gives the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until trump is inaugurated on 20 it is also raising the question of whether the white house pushed back hard enough when intelligence agencies concluded on 7 that officials could have authorized these a a computer expert at the center for strategic and international studies in dismissed the claim that it had deterred hacking seems a little bold to claim this is a success for since the deterred from doing he said hacking work was mostly complete the issue now is whether they will be deterred in the and the guessing is they will not strong private warnings enough to constitute in the appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than north did for its attack on pictures entertainment in 2014 that attack melted down about 70 percent of computers and servers at its wreaking considerable and embarrassed many executives it was in response to the release of a that imagined a plot to kill the north leader after the the united states issued more sanctions against north and encouraged china to limit the all of which runs through switching centers many experts had expected the white house to follow a similar path with the white house concluded that the and the unstated suggestion that the united states had the power to reach inside networks and see the origin of might suffice it is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against before departure from but that seems less and less likely the 31 warning did not deal with the hacking of the democratic national committee or which r clapper the director of national had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the leadership it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process and the fear it was originating from though it stopped short of saying it was a attack

as negotiators meet in morocco to hammer out details of the landmark global climate change accord reached in almost a year the independent international energy agency warned that the nearly deal was too weak to meet its avowed temperature target the annual world energy outlook stated that reaching the targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was and that meeting those targets would slow climate change yet the estimates also showed that the result of those reductions was not likely to keep the temperature increase beyond preindustrial levels 2 degrees as hoped the authors meeting the national commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions would still allow temperatures to rise 2 7 degrees by 2100 meeting the most ambitious temperature goal discussed at the conference would be next to the report transformation required for a reasonable chance of remaining within the temperature goal of 1 5 degrees is a shifting mix of energy sources that favors renewable energy and more efficient energy use are putting those targets within reach the annual report of the international energy based in noted that renewable energy was with more capacity added in 2015 than for oil and nuclear power combined fossil fuels will have a substantial role to play in the global energy mix for many years to come especially natural which is rapidly displacing coal era of fossil fuels is far from being even if the pledges are fully said executive director of the agency he the share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix is about 81 if goals are the share will drop only to 74 percent by 2040 this is in part because even though renewable energy sources are finding their way into electricity oil is still an important source of power for transportation and petrochemical production there are winners and losers within fossil said the biggest winner worldwide in the projections is natural and the biggest loser is coal the largest coal producer and has been pulling back and appears to have reached the peak of its coal use in 2013 declined to discuss the effect on the projections of the election of j who has called climate change a and pledged to abandon the deal and to promote a revival of coal are a technical said come and go around the and this is a perfectly normal he said the group would be watching the actual policies and actions that emerge from the trump since changes may have global once the policies do will include in future said the report predicted that by 80 percent of the new energy generated to meet global demand would come from natural gas and renewable sources like solar and wind power a push to use energy more efficiently is expected to help in the fight against climate citing predictions that world energy use is expected to rise more slowly than in the even in the face of continued economic growth an analyst with the institute for energy economics and financial a progressive research organization based in said that the decline of coal and the explosion in renewable energy provided a simple who exit fossil fuels and embrace solar and wind will reap financial rewards and avoid stranded is a term applied to fossil fuel reserves such as coal and natural gas that are still in the in many scenarios of addressing climate companies would not be able to exploit their reserves oil companies like have disputed the issue the new report states that unless governments work hard to address the issue for a smooth and orderly transition away from fossil is a risk that major losses will be
as the technology industry came to grips in the last week with the reality of a presidential election that did not go its many in silicon valley landed on the idea that widespread misinformation spread was a primary factor in the outcome on both and altered their advertising policies to explicitly prohibit sites that traffic in fake news from making money off lies very likely a worthwhile even if it comes too late the has loosened our collective grasp on the and efforts to fight that dismaying trend are obviously worth pursuing yet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news in the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the with billions of people glued to and other popular social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events the election of j trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society they have subsumed and gutted mainstream media they have undone traditional political advantages like and access to advertising and they are destabilizing and replacing institutions and established ways of doing including political transnational organizations and unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia most because these services allow people to communicate with one another more they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among groups these ad hoc social movements range widely in from white supremacists in the united states to in to in the middle east to the hacker collectives of eastern and but each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable resulting in sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms now have billions of people on the and most of them are not that happy with the status said the president of the a research firm that forecasts global risks think their local government is authoritarian they think on the wrong side of the establishment aggrieved by identity politics and a middle many factors accounted for economic anxiety in the industrial an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national and some mix of latent xenophobia and sexism across the electorate but as even trump acknowledged in an interview with aired social media played a determining role in the race in the the concerns of supporters might have been and his candidacy would almost certainly have foundered after he was universally written off by just about every mainstream and he faced disadvantages in organization and access to traditional political expertise yet by putting out a message that resonated with people trump hacked through every established political order this new people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their said it for social i see trump for people who like an predictable this is the scariest thing about not that it may be full of lies problem that could potentially be but that its scope gives it real power to change history in unpredictable ways but where we are time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the forces that their boosters long promised they would be and to be rather than by the huge social changes they could uncork this should come as no surprise in a we are now living through a kind of version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media over much of the last we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world there was the green revolution in and the spring in the middle east and north in the united we saw the occupy wall street movement and the protests social networks also played a role in electoral politics first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of dean in and then in the election of the first president in 2008 yet now those movements look like the prelude to a crackup in the global order in this organizing on played a major role in the push to get the country to leave the union in the a firebrand mayor who was vastly outspent by managed to marshal a huge army of supporters to help him win the presidency the state has used social networks to recruit from around the world to fight in and as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas and in the united both a socialist who ran for president as a and who was once reviled by most members of the party he now relied on movements to shatter the political status quo why is this all happening clay a professor at new university who has studied the effects of social suggested a few reasons one is the ubiquity of which has reached a truly epic scale last month the company reported that about 1 8 billion people now log on to the service every month because social networks feed off the various permutations of interactions among they become strikingly more powerful as they grow with about a quarter of the population now on the possibilities are staggering the technology gets when the crazy social effects get said one of those social effects is what calls the of the a term coined by the researcher p to describe the range of subjects that the mainstream media deems publicly acceptable to discuss from about the early until the very recent it was usually considered unwise for politicians to court views deemed by most of society to be out of the things like overt calls to racial bias were of like the but the shifted that window was kept at bay because of pluralistic said person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the about immigrants or was willing to say white were more than other kinds of they know how many others shared their thanks to the now each person
it would be easy to miss the mosque in a temporary building with a concrete floor and corrugated roof but it is impossible to miss the constellation of six loudspeakers atop a giant metal structure resembling the tower five times a starting well before these loudspeakers broadcast the call to prayer in a city of and near international and therein lies one more friction point in a country full of them one expression of faith is noise and government is planning a crackdown a proposal backed by prime minister and initially endorsed this week by his ministers would authorize the government to ban the use of loudspeakers by mosques and other houses of worship across for many on both sides of the sectarian few questions could prove more provocative than whether the muezzin should be muzzled call to prayer is a symbol of said the imam of the one of several that have been controversial here is something existed for 1 , 426 he said that he could hear bells from a church in town and that residents drove around the city every couple of months broadcasting from loudspeakers on their vehicles call of every if you get rid of bother he added and yet it does among those bothered is who is and announced last month that the city would broadcast the a central prayer that begins o to counter the call the first of five daily prayers begins before noted col a member of parliament who introduced the new ban goal of the law is to prevent sleep from being he said have no desire to harm the prayer of the the fight over the muezzin underscores a fundamental societal challenge for beyond its conflict with living in or the occupied west bank about 20 percent of citizens are and cities like where about a third of the nearly 73 , 000 residents are perennially struggle to find a comfortable balance the conflict has also grown in which is divided between largely and communities the proposed approved on by ministers and sent to has drawn denunciations from and the authority in a sign of the complexity of the it drew surprise opposition on from health who temporarily blocked parliamentary debate and sent the issue back to the ministers because it might also affect the use of sirens to announce the beginning of the sabbath a leader of the members of the or said was inflaming sentiments the muezzin law passes the i call on the public in to rise i call for a civil popular he told a television outlet must be called to protect to defend the calls from the of the fund a nonprofit organization that promotes coexistence between and said the proposal conflicted with recent drive to increase investment in communities to reduce gaps in educational and economic opportunities see those two conflicting trends yet which basically tells me that the establishment still made up its mind in regard to its he said do we want from the do we want to really integrate it and include it as an integrated part of the text of the proposed ban on mosque loudspeakers says that of thousands of in parts of habitually and daily from loud and unreasonable noise that is caused by the call of muezzin from colonel said it could be narrowed to apply only to sleeping hours has said he is trying to balance competing interests is committed to freedom for all but is also responsible for protecting citizens from he said this week in which traces its history to the days of frustration over the mosques has grown as more residents have moved in since the evacuation of settlements in a decade ago there is already a noise law on the but advocates of the new legislation said it was not applied to the muezzin someone is having a karaoke party with loudspeakers at night and you call the they will come and take down the said a member of the city council if you call about the they under existing the police must test the level of the call to prayer or of any noise to see if it exceeded the limit the new law would simply ban loudspeakers at the call to prayer was broadcast on at and the tension over the loudspeakers was easy to detect in a visit to a clothes and jewelry market a few blocks away several shoppers and salespeople said that they did not mind the call during daylight but that the earliest one invariably woke them up some described trying to muffle the noise with curtains or often to little effect who moved to about five years said the call made it hard for her and her daughter to sleep through the night say they do but not so she said who was selling was more pointed do it intentionally loud in order to bother he said a few feet a group of vendors said the proposal to limit the muezzin was a slap in the face to them they noted that the call to prayer had been sounded in since long before came to power hate for said 22 are people who are against said the

congressional republicans are settling in for what they hope is a long run in the but j trump want them to get too comfortable going to put on term which a lot of people happy but putting on term trump said in an interview with that aired on doing a lot of things to clean up the if one thing could put trump on a collision course with his new allies on capitol it is his embrace of proposals such as term limits and tougher restrictions on allowing lawmakers and top aides to become lobbyists in the lucrative world of influence peddling members of congress like to talk about returning power to the but many would prefer not to vote to limit their own tenure or future employment opportunities bringing up term limits is seen by some as raining on their parade senator republican of and the majority made that quite clear last week when he said the senate outlook for term limits was severely limited would say we have term limits told reporters called elections and it will not be on the agenda in the highlighting of his call for term limits it is no 1 on his list of priorities to up the corruption and special interest collusion in revives an initiative that has been dormant in for years after republicans rode it to the house takeover in 1994 but then failed to make it happen trump found a surprising kindred spirit on term limits on when president seemed to endorse the concept think we want to see new voices and new ideas said at a news conference part of the reason why i think term limits are a really useful aides said later that might have been referring more to the limit on presidential and his view that set the right precedent by leaving after two terms but his words could certainly be extended to congress proponents of term limits say position has put new energy behind the campaign to adopt a constitutional amendment restricting house members to three terms and senators to two terms other part of the pressure is going to come from the said nick the executive director of the group term limits they know term limits is an issue on the they will make it very difficult for congress to ignore i think congress is going to be forced to vote on term limits have always been popular with voters and got a surge of momentum in the the bums political atmosphere of the early leading multiple states to adopt them for their legislatures through ballot initiatives and other means as part of the with in republicans led by representative newt of promised the legislature and a vote on term limits to replace career politicians with citizen the mantra helped them topple speaker s of a staunch opponent of term via a who promised to serve just six years he later violated that that term limits vote did come in march 1995 and won a majority but fell more than 60 votes short of the majority necessary to advance a constitutional amendment forty many of them committee and subcommittee joined democratic opponents in defeating the proposal the amendment again fell short a year later opponents argued and argue that arbitrary term limits would rob congress of the institutional knowledge and expertise needed to conduct business and that voters had regular opportunities to end the service of their lawmakers they talk about how gerrymandering and the advantages of incumbency make it hard to defeat sitting lawmakers whether the proposal can go anywhere this year will depend on how serious trump and his advisers are about pushing it against the wishes of congressional or whether it was just part of his message to stir up frustrated voters at this it is impossible to but it was a primary element of his call to the that appeared to resonate with the public and term limits are just one issue conservatives also are raising the alarm about a move by house republicans to restore congressional earmarks special spending as long as they are directed to a government agency rather than a private a source of corruption in the past some lawmakers have argued that restoring the ability of individual lawmakers to earmark money would make it easier to pass spending but critics are moving quickly to quash any effort to bring them back with the earmark proposal on the verge of being adopted by republicans on speaker d called off the fearing it would send a bad signal so soon after the election he promised a review of the idea and a vote early next year like other outsiders before trump will discover that draining the swamp is much easier said than done
normal it happened in the transition had delays in hiring w the former new mayor and a leading contender to be j secretary of on the uncertain start to the white house transition
in the leader settled into a seat at center in for a gala performance of ninth symphony but before the third movement was told to leave the order had come from the w the mayor of new at the time and though the administration referred to the ejection as embarrassment to everyone associated with mayor was unmoved calling a terrorist and a he said the next would not invite to anyplace i new city mayors do not typically conduct foreign but who aides to j trump said was the leading contender to become the secretary of has never let an issue like political jurisdiction stand in his way in his eight years as practiced his own local form of international calling for tolerance after the terrorist attacks on the world trade center on sept but also refusing to dine with and threatening to kick the united nations out of the city over unpaid parking summonses after leaving learned more about foreign gaining experience as an international a security consultant and a candidate for the presidency in while honing his positions as a kind of he has been a staunch supporter of deeply suspicious of and a proponent of aggressive military posture his experience as a former federal prosecutor and as mayor has helped shape some of his but it was his experience dealing with the sept 11 attacks that has had the most profound effect on his through it basic approach has been much the peace can be achieved by showing and diplomacy is sometimes best conducted by being undiplomatic in diplomacy you want to set not just go in saying no matter what going to be said an international affairs professor at who worked with several of campaigns the particularly under john he referring to the current secretary of often seen compromise and bending as a first principle i think would replace forays into foreign affairs as mayor were often meant for a local audience many of the for embraced his snub of as for crusade against diplomatic parking new as a are easily enraged by anything related to parking their cars given the racial and ethnic was a vigorous supporter of open a position that could complicate his potential service under trump in he gave a speech at the school of government at in which he spoke glowingly about his who came to the united states from and condemned by the movement in calling it of our most serious public after the sept 11 view of the world became dominated by terrorism at least at by a vision of the future based on inclusiveness and unity a month after the he spoke at the united waxing poetic about new racial and religious multiplicity a city of immigrants unlike any other within a nation of he adding that has been our greatest source of it was primarily on the strength of that bipartite vision tolerance and toughness that left office and entered the private pitching himself as an international fixer who could revamp police as he was hired to do in or eradicate as he suggested in a speech in el needed to be done there his speeches and private contracts earned him millions of and have now drawn criticism for their potential conflicts of among them a deal by his security advise the oil company in a united states ally that supported some movements when ran for president in he was mocked by his opponents for to the terrorist attacks on new as vice president r famously said during his own 2008 presidential there were only three things that ever seemed to mention in a a and but the specter of terrorism continued to inform in his own unsuccessful white house run and this as he advocated for trump on a trip to in while he was competing in the republican he said he supported president w decisions to invade and though he criticized how the wars had been waged a vociferous critic of the nuclear deal the united states signed with last has long harbored concerns about that intentions even as the united states was at war in he said that could pose a greater danger is maybe in many ways or is certainly dangerous than he said at a meeting in 2007 during his presidential campaign think this is an area in which clarity is enormously important had wars because of lack of had great misunderstandings that have led to violence because of lack of clarity if if you elect me as president of the united this will be very clear to i will not allow them under any circumstances to become a nuclear power they are too though has no formal foreign policy bona he has traveled the world meeting dignitaries and advising foreign governments at least on a private jet he borrowed from trump probably traveled to and more often in the last five and a years than any of the people who are running for he said in 2007 had the responsibilities of safety and security on my shoulders for much of the last 20 or 25 years actually dealt with terrorism actually dealt with it but part of what that experience has taught him is even for a diplomacy has its limits at the republican national convention this he gave speech in support of trump during which it became clear that the already muscular stance on foreign policy he held eight years ago had only hardened after eight years of the administration must not be afraid to define our enemy it is extremist said know who you he added to applause coming to get

for restless conservatives were told to wait wait until the republicans controlled the house wait until they had the senate as well wait until they occupied the white house they have all three and one of the biggest unknowns facing j trump is how long they will wait for him as trump begins putting together a the ideological purists of the hard suspicious that his campaign pledge to upend will give way to business as are already watching warily as he makes his initial personnel and policy choices am advising trump to the conservative radio host savage said this week if he loses his base on the first going to happen in the first for even decision to appoint k a champion of the nationalist and populist movement that helped fuel his was not enough they still attacked his choice of a career party as chief of staff some on the right are already publicly pressuring trump to keep republicans they deem too ideologically soft out of his a process evident on in a battle over who will choose and lead the new foreign policy and national security teams as trump adjusts to his role as head of the republican party an institution that he and many of his followers criticized as too disconnected from its base the must reconcile a sprawling and the ideological crosscurrents it with the demands of an impatient group of conservatives in congress and beyond who are less inclined than ever to compromise on their principles going to have to either eat their eat trump or get used to said rich editor of national review and an influential conservative commentator nothing else that ever trump starts with an advantage he is not tainted as a member of the political elite the populist right wants to take down but to achieve his boldest campaign a professed master deal has to find a way to get his agenda past a house speaker he does not fully d and the conservatives in congress who do not share his views on issues including trade and increased government spending on infrastructure trump has to reconcile the conflicting factions of his while giving voters what they said they wanted most from a new change in the way works the tensions are already visible in the transition planning on the departure of mike a former republican congressman aligned with the more traditional conservative signaled how the players within orbit are exerting influence no sci do what your customer said representative a republican himself an insurgent conservative who won a primary two years ago to end the career of the republican majority leader at the said he believed trump could afford to be aggressive because people elected him bring the fight to as someone who displays little ideological consistency and has a long history of backing away from his toughest trump has priorities that remain fuzzy one of his first likely acts as would pit him against many of the conservatives in his a trillion infrastructure plan and he is already sowing confusion about his commitment to dismantling the affordable care act after saying late last week that he would like to retain certain like the provision that lets young adults stay on their plan going to be the problem said the former republican national committee chairman who has helped informally advise trump the people who pulled him over the finish watching to you empower us to help you drain the or are you just going to add more swamp the conservatives who found a hero in trump through his brand of populism are not likely to be placated by and conciliations are and we need to make sure that there are qualified people around said chief executive of heritage action for a conservative policy group said he was encouraged by what he had heard so far from trump republican party is a party gotten by repeating said it speaking to where a lot of are trump he know in short order how that all works what could be especially dangerous for trump is the combustible nature of the populist politics he inflamed and its especially in its tea to turn on its own it is a movement that always seems in search of a fight is the and this is the laura a conservative radio told her audience the other day is your victory take a little time to savor and then got to gear up because there are a lot of battles to fight whether those battles are the same as those trump wants is another issue altogether how trump meets the expectations of his base on the subject of illegal immigration will be one of his biggest tests no other issue animated it more but trump has sent conflicting signals about whether he intends to follow through on the great he vowed to erect along the border with backing away from that perhaps the promise of his would no doubt induce anger and anxiety among some though others seem willing to grant him some leeway he talked about technology and how we need a barrier between the two said representative r republican of who campaigned across the country for trump and speaks to his team regularly of it is virtual some of it is trump will also have to contend with public opinion in determining how hard to push he is poised to enter office with the dubious distinction of being seen as

to it seemed like the perfect decades of animosity between the united states and were peeling opening a final frontier in the to a business school gave up a career in private equity to break into the travel market he started a company that organizes trips for to legally visit a business made possible because president has broadened travel to the island and expanded licenses for to do business there so what happens wonders on the campaign j trump threatened to roll back the sweeping dtente with lambasting the made to its communist government and raising the possibility that one of signature foreign policy initiatives could be stripped away am still trying to think about what this means for my business that i spent literally the last two years working setting up something that was going to be perfect for an open said we go back to the old i know if i have a business a huge hundreds of thousands of people have taken advantage of decisions to loosen travel and other restrictions on

more hotels are set to open rents private and airlines is about to start direct flights to for and the critical question remains whether a real estate mogul and hotel will be a businessman at heart and allow measures to continue or if he will instead keep a vow he made and scale back everything from diplomatic relations to the unlimited rum and cigars recently allowed from such a move by trump

other been vague on the issue during the primary he repeatedly said he thought restoring diplomatic relations with was but added that the united states and the people did not get enough in return but as the election trump grew less equivocal in he told that he would continue having diplomatic relations with but he said he would want better deals than trump took a harder line in this fall of the concessions has granted the regime were done through executive which means the next president can reverse and that i will do unless the regime meets our trump said at a campaign event in my demands our vice mike pence reaffirmed that stance on saying trump would repeal executive orders unless there was political and religious asked by a reporter if his comments meant he would break off diplomatic relations with trump suggested that he and said he probably would not appoint an ambassador to agreement president signed is a very weak he said get nothing the people of get and i would do whatever is necessary to get a good l a lawyer who specializes in united trade said trump seemed to believe that had struck a single deal with when in reality there are several agreements that range from direct mail to managing oil spills trump could pick through them one by one to eliminate the ones he dislikes and keep others but muse said the government could be financially liable if it pulled out the rug from under companies that had acted in good faith enhanced travel that has introduced would be the most tragic thing trump might but i think he muse said has invested a lifetime in resorts and hotel and a global enterprise it seems what else could trump change travel rules tourism to is still illegal under the but president bill was the first to allow excursions that allow travelers to go if the trip for for educational or religious purposes president w bush scrapped and then expanded them so that travelers no longer needed to get special permission first under a could visit once

from the the central enigma was j trump how did this celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so who were the supporting him and when i started my unusual assignment of covering the presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent for an news organization one of the first things i did was to invite questions from international readers the bulk of them revolved around whose unorthodox romp through the republican primaries propelled him to the nomination and ultimately to the presidency going back through my journey across there were many clues to rising although not all were easy to read i drank with trump supporters in bars and casinos i approached them at rodeos i chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies the broad topography of trump country in many easy to trace it is a place of anger and gripped by a feverish sentiment people wanted change and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life yet other factors were at in this unruly factors that sometimes made it hard to see talk social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country it always clear which elements were powering the as the movement called and which were being buoyed along one of my first stops was a decimated coal town in west it had a sports which offered beer for on and a biker bar it was patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke both were filled with trump little surprise since he had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the environmental regulations and cheap natural gas in i also saw how message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core republican constituency in conversations after church on many glossed over the three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease like trump told stern in it was hard to but perhaps that was the that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this one in which outrageous might offer a route to success around that apple released its seventh iteration of the that glossy black totem of progress inscribed on the back of every are the words in assembled in as if is a separate country and how many in trump country saw it that instead of being part of the they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas one thing that like many and other had long seen as distinguishing the united states was its restless optimism and innate traded on pessimism his great embodied a vision that aimed to restore pride in the military and but also scapegoated minorities and at most of the faces in the crowd were white people flew confederate flags they spoke impatiently about prejudice toward was openly a factory owner in told me that children in which has the largest percentage of had stayed home from school in droves on sept 11 because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks the atmosphere at trump rallies was permissive if someone said something offensive or there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted yet in another confounding a significant minority of trump supporters were minorities themselves i met people who defied neat a black woman in her who worked at a record label in a driver in las a doorman in at a rally in the final week in a rust belt state that would prove central to i saw how the candidate connected with crowd when he it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his listening for the smallest murmur of which he would seize upon and amplify it reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians seen during my years based in what was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating maybe these were just the loyalists polls suggested that trump was behind in many places critical to electoral college victory political including dismissed the notion that trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters like the hunt for the lost tribes of the was how a consultant who had worked for the 2012 republican mitt put it early on you paddle your canoe far enough up the and bang your drum hard they will come to the riverbank but just not but when i mentioned the polls showing trump lagging to his they snorted derisively everyone they knew was voting trump children some were former democrats others were people who voted for decades the they were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow at the i discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the echo chamber that became so powerful in this election but in broad the trump supporters were right in key their votes were by pollsters the winning margin in many like was and the failure of democrats to mobilize turnout was also a major factor the driver who took me from a trump rally to the was a case in he was an a registered and he did not intend to vote of them look any good to he said benefited also from the antipathy so many people felt toward his this was another theme in the questions that poured in from international why did so many seem to hate her so the answer had many fatigue from her decades in public unfinished business from her time in power in the distaste for how she had handled his sexual outrage over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and her taking in huge sums for speeches to wall street unfiltered sexism

not definitive until he was in his hotel room that night in in an interview the next and in a series of chats on the trod declining to offer any direct criticism of trump he and his aides plan to welcome the trump appointees who will soon run the state hoping to build relationships with them persuade them to keep some of diplomatic deals but also made clear that when he leaves office he will

trump made little more than pronouncements on climate and the details of the policies remain largely unknown but he has described climate science as a hoax perpetrated by the to undermine the and his

family had taken in her disabled as an act of not bigamy but the headlines branded her and called her career was evicted from her home and forced to withdraw her daughter from school the cartoonist literally drew her as the devil and the conventional wisdom that women would support each other turned on its head the suffragist support that had boosted candidacy fractured a columnist for the commercial wrote that while certain men may vote for a candidate who is somewhat less than a female candidate must present as paragon of if she hoped to the feminine vote of the country in support of her political in the theory that women would vote together in the interest of their gender soared and crashed once again this was supposed to be the election where women formed a coalition to block

another who implied that a female journalist was on her period when he like her who said his female opponent look it was supposed to be the election in which women rejected the candidate who hates women in favor of the candidate who is one although won women last week exit polls showed that 54 percent of women voted for her she also lost women the vote was drawn and quartered by geography and 94 percent of black women voted for while 53 percent of white women voted for j 53 percent of married women voted for 62 percent of white women who attend college too over initial polls suggest that female voters were slightly less likely to vote for the democrat than they were in 2012 and the most offensive thing mitt ever said about women was that he had consulted binders full of their in order to hire them to his staff the idea of a is both a lofty dream and an ugly little myth been in circulation before women could legally cast a ballot in a proponent of suffrage argued in the new times that women more of the virtues of good and than men do and in b claimed that when women earned the right to collectively seize the moral high ground female voters to do away with vice and to prevent

said he supported suffrage only because he knew it would not challenge the status quo there was danger that women might overthrow anything he might be a reason to prevent their last on election female supporters traveled to the new cemetery where b is buried they wore yellow roses and affixed their stickers to her tombstone in an act of feminist tribute but the suffragists who fought for a right to vote were invested in enfranchising a particular kind of woman their pitch for political consciousness was rooted not in the collective experience of but in an image of white feminine virtue many white suffragists pointedly ignored the women of color in the movement a white socialite turned gave herself the title of and led an of women from new to in 1913 when a group of southern men confronted her to ask if she favored suffrage for black she telling them that the must solve their own and when a group of black women tried to join her march in she refused to acknowledge their existence they took up the back of the line for a few hundred feet before falling away in a white woman at a meeting of the woman suffrage association complained that new had become for the trash of all and argued that suffrage ought to be carefully restricted to keep undesirable women out of the ballot box what it means to give it to all she said criminal and pauper men have there are thousands of female operatives in tobacco factories and similar fields of there are probably two million women in this country who are but little uplifted above the plane of here was a woman who was denied one of her most basic rights and yet she was content to argue that she should get the vote only once it was safely denied to most other women after she was already empowered through her proximity to white men if lower immigrant women could that soft power could be compromised some women were so satisfied with that arrangement that they rejected suffrage outright in an anonymous woman wrote to the new

this election year has often felt like one enormous swarm of poll vote forecasts and nonstop statistical analysis and coverage has provided little relief how key was the vote to j did young voters shy away from what about all this number crunching led the two of us a and a polling editor to wonder what might be missed when we try to explain entire groups as being or if we write that rural voters were especially likely to back are there assumptions that we might be but that actually hold true for many rural if we say that millennial voters were unlikely to support are we getting the full the video above is our attempt to unpack just a few of these terms we hope it will serve as an invitation to keep and to look at the headlines we see reporting exit poll statistics as only telling part of the story
models are the statistician box once said this year was no exception on a model built by j campaign gave him an 8 percent chance of has reported at that point in the the model gave him the same chances by election his odds were but trump was still not favored to win near the end of the a model built by the republican national committee showed him losing over all and in states like and according to politico won each of those so did trump simply beat the or were the odds wrong all one of the reasons assessing models is so tricky is that difficult to know for sure only over the long run that a model can be judged to be well calibrated what we can is check to see how fragile our model was to different assumptions what we said on the last day of the based on we said had about an 85 percent chance of winning and trump 15 or slightly less than a shot the final result of far from what we thought was the single most likely and our live forecast was quick to adjust as votes began coming in but final electoral count most likely 306 to once the race in has been called is well within the range of what we said was plausible the chart below shows which outcomes we thought were most likely were we too at various points during the the editor of called the model to react to new polls we preferred analysis suggested that very few voters changed their minds and that the impact of most campaign events was small given the amount of uncertainty in the a model should not overreact to a single poll released three months before election day but in her blamed letters from the b delivered to congress 11 and two days before election day and campaign models moved sharply in the last few as did our own so what if we had used only the final 10 days of would we have given trump higher we would but not by much if we had used only the final 10 days of we would have given about an 80 percent chance of only slightly lower than what we actually said and still far above 50 percent even shorter windows give similar results no window of polls that would have pushed trump to be the favorite what if we had assumed and would all shift in addition to whether older polls are one of the biggest differences between models involved the question of how much the states move together does a polling miss in one state tell you much about a polling miss in other the technical word for this is correlation if the states are more the possible distribution of outcomes gets wider if the states move the distribution gets narrower our model kept this parameter at a middle the states were neither perfectly correlated nor perfectly independent even at its most making the states move together more flattens the distribution and makes a win from trump more but at best he would have been just a 24 percent favorite what if fit our model somehow knowing the results of it probably would not have changed much the state polls missed by larger margins in 2016 than they had in recent but the results completely unexpected it feels like an even larger miss because the polls missed by enough in enough swing states to give the election to the trailing candidate via the electoral college national polling performed better than a lot of people is increasing her lead in the popular vote by the day it may take months for analysts to determine why state polls were far off in the and northeast modern polling faces including the decreasing use of landlines and the increasing difficulty in finding people willing to but we can expect the polling industry to work to adapt what would we do what would we think next time about a state like dozens of polls showed with a most above four points none showed trump ahead in our polling database of presidential polls since we found 248 examples in which a candidate led in every poll of a state conducted in the final 150 days of the including 49 where the margin was within 10 points states with only one the trailing candidate won in only two cases three if you count others were north in 1980 and south in 1992 in each every poll showed the democrat and the republican candidate won the even among races won by less than 10 a win rate of 94 percent about the same as the 93 percent chance we gave in models are box some are was the upshot forecast we think a quantitative forecast can help people to take a step back from obsessing over the latest daily poll release by averaging polls together and arriving at a probabilistic the aim is to help people take a more nuanced view of the one that is less driven by whatever the latest polling number happens to and instead summarizes all of the available with the context of history but we humans are bad at understanding uncertainty reactions to victory suggest despite our we failed at explaining that an 85 percent chance is not a 100 percent chance if we did it all we would probably emphasize uncertainty in a more visceral rather than using a simple statement of an analogy to a event like an field goal or a shaded margin of error by more effectively communicating the uncertainty in the hope to give our readers a more useful indicator of the state of the race one that is built on data rather than anecdote and conjecture
the expansion of a central pillar of the affordable care faces immense uncertainty next with j trump and top republicans in congress embracing proposals that could leave millions of poorer without health insurance and jeopardize a major element of president legacy but influential figures in surprising quarters of the new administration might balk at a broad rollback of favoring new conditions for access to the government insurance program for the poor but not wholesale cutbacks mike the vice is proud of the expansion he engineered as governor of one of 31 states that expanded eligibility under the affordable care act the program has conservative features that emphasize and require beneficiaries to make monthly contributions to savings accounts earmarked for health care another trump gov of new hails the expansion of in his saying more than half a million people are receiving and better health the federal government pays the full cost for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016 and at least 90 percent of the costs in later years under the health law it is hard to overstate the importance of which insures 77 million pays for more than half of all births in some covers about of nursing home residents and provides treatment for many people addicted to spending on by the federal government and states exceeds billion a year of the 20 million people who have gained coverage under the affordable care officials 12 million are insured by with few of the problems that have plagued the new insurance or marketplaces but change is coming in his campaign trump said congress must repeal the affordable care act and give each state a lump sum of federal money a block grant for congress passed legislation in to repeal the health law and roll back its expansion vetoed the but speaker d of has vowed to put similar legislation on a republican desk without even waiting for the trump administration is almost certain to give states more leeway to run their programs as they federal and state officials say a number of states have already proposed and work requirements for people on in an effort to protect the administration has limited the use of and has not allowed work requirements but state officials say that such changes are likely to be allowed in some form in a trump administration the director of the department of human said that with the election of she saw real chance for states to take back a bit of control over and other safety net who stepped down in after 10 years as the director of predicted that will be greater receptivity in the new administration to state proposals that were shut down by the the top federal official from 2009 to said it was entirely possible that a trump administration would different about the vehicle

were united states citizens and residents of the state the requirements undermine efficiency and quality of the administration said new will have a republican governor for the first time in 12 years and could submit similar proposals to the trump administration in the administration approved a waiver allowing to charge premiums to people with incomes above the poverty level a year for a family of but federal officials refused to allow work requirements or a time limit on and they said the state could not charge premiums to people below the poverty level the administration also rejected request for a waiver to charge premiums and suspend coverage for people who failed to pay a policy it said would jeopardize coverage for more than 125 , 000 people in where more than 400 , 000 people have gained coverage because of the expansion of gov an outspoken republican critic of the health is seeking federal approval for a waiver allowing work premiums and negotiations over a proposed block

the harvest had just begun when agents from the immigration and naturalization service stormed across the onion fields of in sweeping up 21 immigrants who were trudging behind tractors without legal authorization to work in the united pulling onions out of the ground for 75 cents per bag the fallout was unexpected senator republican of wrote to the immigration complaining of its and inappropriate enforcement against farmers who are simply trying to get their products from the field to the representative blasted the immigration and immigration enforcement shortly after the onion growers in 19 counties were granted a temporary amnesty to keep their workers as long as their paperwork looked legitimate welcome to reality last j trump was elected president based on a straightforward promise to make the united states great again he aimed his message primarily at tens of millions of white who feel left behind in the growing economic undercut by the advancement of minorities and competition from illegal immigrants at home and cheap workers in other countries this trump is being forced to acknowledge that his straightforward solutions in much less straightforward than he promised they would be the big and beautiful wall might look more like a fence most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants be summarily he backing off a line from stump speeches earlier in the campaign perhaps only two or three million just the bad guys that number is in the ballpark of deportations in the administration undocumented immigrants who are not he are trump has not yet clarified his promises on but most experts say it will be very hard to simply walk away from and impose a 45 percent tariff against imports from china an age of global supply said of the school of government at cannot take a chain saw to trade agreements and not end up cutting your foot sure but where does that leave to the political scientist at the apparent shift in position is unsurprising politicians follow the interests of average he they hew to the interests of the rich instincts on economic policy seem to have fallen by the wayside over the course of the told me the need to work with republicans in congress will probably reinforce that in his book published this offered a snapshot of voter preferences in before the onset of the financial crisis on the bottom of the income most voters supported policies to provide jobs and equalize incomes but at the most opposed them the picture was reversed when voters were asked about cuts to government spending the rich were much more supportive than the poor and what did voters after a brief flurry of fiscal stimulus to stop the economy from careening into the they got a round of automatic budget cuts called the sequester the transformation of populist agenda into a rather more orthodox list of republican goals may well follow the same script his proposal for huge tax cuts which would reduce federal revenue by as much as trillion over a according to the nonpartisan tax policy center would shower favors mostly on even as he backs away from mass trump is now talking about echoing the house who wants to weave his goal of replacing health care for the elderly with vouchers to buy private insurance into the campaign promise to overhaul the affordable care act is going to happen is said a political scientist what will want to do is quite while trump has pitched deregulation notably the repeal of president clean power plan as an engine for job growth in the rust he is also set to deliver enormous gains to wall street by undoing core provisions of the which was established to hem in the financial sector and prevent a repeat of the crisis of 2008 there is definitely a silver lining if trump is really letting go of the most extreme elements of his agenda the economic and social dislocation that would be caused by deporting 5 percent of workers would be immense may not be the best agreement in the china certainly cheats but igniting trade wars with the biggest trading partners would not improve the livelihoods of working class but the only real sliver of good news for is in proposal for infrastructure spending on a yet unspecified but surely huge scale but how will base respond if that program is financed largely by temporarily cutting corporate taxes to 10 percent or so to encourage businesses with profits parked abroad to bring them and would it be enough to restore prosperity to the working for political analysts on the left have been perplexed by who give their vote to a republican party whose motivating principle revolves around delivering tax cuts to the rich this time they delivered their vote to a republican who promised to directly address their plight he has already come up short oxford under its most upbeat assumptions a big tax cut and infrastructure spending delivering a lot of economic stimulus while new trade barriers are limited foresees growth picking up for a while before falling back to the rate of roughly 2 percent a year that the united states has been living with for the last seven years if trump pursues oxford economics predicts the economy will plunge into recession under either the frustrated voters who cast their vote for trump are likely to remain as frustrated as stuck with insufficient education in a world of low growth and diminishing opportunity maybe they will figure out that most of the industrial jobs they lost are gone for that protectionism bring them and that the main driver of their plight is technological change deporting a couple of million in and engaging in a some prominent trade spats may let off some political steam but otherwise it help the critical question then is not so much how supporters will respond politically but how trump will react to their inevitable disappointment who is generally sympathetic to the notion

victory that took him by his team was improvising the most basic traditions of assuming power that included working without official state department briefing materials in his first conversations with foreign leaders two officials who had been handling national security for the former representative mike rogers of and a lobbyist who consults with corporations and foreign were fired both were part of what officials described as a purge orchestrated by and close adviser the dismissals followed the abrupt firing on of gov of new who was replaced as chief of the transition by vice mike pence a transition official was systematically dismissing people like rogers who had ties with as a federal had sent father to jail prominent allies were in the meantime scrambling to figure out how and when to contact trump at they have been patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little according to a western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations president of was the first to reach trump for such a call last followed by prime minister of not long afterward but that was about 24 hours before prime minister may of got through a striking break from diplomatic practice given the close alliance between the united states and despite the haphazard nature of early calls with world his advisers said the transition team was not suffering unusual setbacks they argued that they were hard at work behind the scenes dealing with the same troubles that incoming presidents have faced for decades and trump himself fired back at critics with a twitter message he sent about 10 organized process taking place as i decide on cabinet and many other he wrote am the only one who knows who the finalists the process is said w the former new who emerged on as the leading contender to be secretary of state happened in the transition had delays in hiring who made his comments in a telephone is a hard thing to do transitions always have glitches this is an enormously complex there were some reports within the transition of one member of the transition team said that at least one reason rogers had fallen out of favor among advisers was as chairman of the house intelligence he had overseen a report about the 2012 attacks on the diplomatic compound in which concluded that the administration had not intentionally misled the public about the events there that report echoed the findings of numerous other government investigations into the episode the conclusions were at odds with the campaign position of who repeatedly blamed his democratic opponent and the secretary of state during the for the resulting deaths of four a a former state department official who had criticized trump during the campaign but said after his election that he would keep an open mind about advising said on twitter that he had changed his opinion after speaking to the transition he he had my stay he screaming will be a conservative republican who served under president

transition difficulties may reflect the fact that who has no governing experience or network and campaigned as an agent of does not have a long list of establishment figures from the bush era to tap his allies suggested that might ultimately prove positive for trump if he was able to assemble a functioning team that would bring new perspectives to his administration for advice on building national security his inner circle has been relying on three hawkish current and former representative republican of who is chairman of the house intelligence peter a former republican congressman and former chairman of the intelligence and frank a pentagon official during the administration and a founder of the center for security policy has long advanced baseless conspiracy including that

so just when we thought that 2016 get any more it with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned greetings from the land of duck and not sure quite sunk in but foods and subterranean real estate are in demand and sounds like a hunting club so where shall we a little weary of the conversations get right to what do you think will happen trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog will chase squirrels the world will go on glad to hear taking it well he stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future been since i came to at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable i made a things are looking better already both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think we in all that much demand and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side looking at a president trump and a house and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to w who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion but was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in and sure here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to is spinal turn it up to 11 give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed we part company here my perception of was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that left behind the old congress now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the house gym secretly a lot of them are actually but i take your point and another recommendation i would make to president make friends everyplace that was the magic golf with the same people every week since i have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so see what he comes up with i know a big fan his agenda and agenda really do congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe plan includes a health care replacement plan for it will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered i realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing this is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big but move on obviously cranky how any other how about the early the republican establishment seems to have as white house chief of staff but is going to be chief strategist which could mean anything to me is the kind of guy democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a republican white house but is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the trump crowd who do you think will really have the it looks like both will be influential after watching the i find pair of appointments too surprising they signal

you were to look at our game board of all the possible outcomes of the this one even on the that was how mark t chief executive of the large health insurer described the election of j trump as the next president he was speaking with me last on stage at the new annual playing for the long term started with a fresh piece of paper yesterday we had no idea how to approach said business executives across the nation and the world have been whipping out fresh pieces of paper to map how election and republican control of the white senate and house which may make notorious gridlock a memory will reshape economic policy the stock market has taking many prognosticators by in anticipation of the seismic changes trump has a repeal or refashioning of the affordable care a dismantling of the regulations for wall a substantial haircut for corporate and personal income tax and a major infrastructure spending among other things while the new conventional wisdom may be that the nation is about to see comprehensive the truth is that it is likely to be more incremental than across the board for the wall street reform and consumer protection act while you would think much of the finance industry would salivate at the chance to rid itself of the its view is more nuanced most companies have made large investments and changes in their business practices to comply with the law so hard to see how even the opponents in the industry would press for the full repeal that trump said he would pursue omelet has been that toothpaste is out of the c the chief executive of said at the conference want regulation to be repealed in he added you want to be good for you have to have policies that would be good for economic more likely than a administration will try to eliminate the components he has criticized most a trump administration could try to weaken the consumer financial protection the watchdog agency created by which republicans for example probably be a research analyst at capital alpha partners in wrote in a note to clients would be horrible politics and optics to get rid of an agency that was established to protect the little predicted that the trump administration would be able to push through a switch that critics of the agency have long lobbied a shift in control of the consumer bureau from a single director to a bipartisan commission trump might also focus on changing a rule for small banks that grow to more than billion in assets such growth catapults a bank into a new regulatory one that comes with much stricter scrutiny and more elaborate reporting requirements this rule has been criticized by the banking industry as an impediment to growth and competition as for the return of something trump has talked about bet on it republican call for a return to a division of commercial and investment banking be taken wrote was part of a campaign document big banks are useful as a populist and trump may continue to use them in that way but neither he or his top aides are interested in piecemeal change may also be true of pledge to undo which was one of his bedrock campaign promises of will be a repeal and i think the repeal will be at a minimum in nearly impossible for the law to be replaced with the flip of a switch going to happen in the next he said have people signed we have to honor that through 2017 have to work quickly to have something for said that whatever replacement plan might the government was not going to just stop insuring the 20 million or so people who are covered under the affordable care act put them out on the street without he said his expectation is that advantage will be expanded the backpedaling on the pledge has already trump has said in the past several days that he intends to make sure that health insurers will not be able to turn away people with and that people under the age of 26 will still be able to have coverage under their plans about the latter trump said he would much try and keep in an interview with of that aired the said that the measure but very much something going to try and of the biggest question is how trump is going to create a new manufacturing class in he has suggested that he is going to renegotiate trade increase tariffs on goods and deport illegal immigrants both for security he and because they take jobs from how those ambitions ultimately play out is guess one issue that trump has seemingly avoided is that of how new technologies are steadily taking jobs jobs that are routine are going to be replaced by the chairman of the parent company of said at the conference a truth that may be at odds with ambitions had an optimistic outlook about how technology already provides unappreciated benefits jobs are infinitely safer today because robots do the dangerous he said take that for despite all of the among surprised about the outcome of the there was a sense of optimism or at least a sense of hope that pervaded their words all know a lot about trump the campaigner now we have to find out about the trump who needs to get things said will start to think not about getting elected but about what his legacy is going to he continued assume you go into that office and you think about your place in history and things going to see how it goes before i become

just a few blocks down avenue from the white house sits the trump international one of the newest luxury additions to j real estate and perhaps the most visible symbol of the ethical quandary he now confronts the trump international operates out of the old post office which the federal government owns that means trump will be appointing the head of the general services which manages the while his children will be running a hotel that has tens of millions of dollars in ties with the agency he also will oversee the national labor relations board while it decides union disputes involving any of his hotels a week before the the board ruled against hotel in a case in las the layers of potential conflicts he faces are in many ways as complex as his business adding a heightened degree of difficulty for trump one of the wealthiest men to ever occupy the white house in separating his official duties from his private business affairs further complicating matters are decision to name his children to his transition and what is likely to be their informal advisory role in his administration his daughter trump joined an official transition meeting on the day before gov of new jersey was removed from his post leading the effort trump has said he will eliminate ethical concerns by turning the management of his company over to his an arrangement he has referred to as a blind trust but ethics lawyers both republicans and democrats say it is far from blind because he would have knowledge of the assets in the trust and be in contact with the people running making it unlike a conventional blind trust controlled entirely by an independent party say that his children running his businesses is the equivalent of a blind trust there is simply no credibility in that said t a lawyer and republican who has worked on the presidential campaigns of john rand and rick the public elected him knowing he has these but unless he deals with this properly there will just be a steady trickle of these and it could be a drag on his as part of his bid for the white released information about his financial which include more than a dozen hotels and golf commercial real estate including trump tower and 40 wall street in new and marketing deals in the united states and abroad but it is unclear how much information was not in part because he declined to release even a summary

stock holdings into a blind trust after he was elected vice and jimmy carter turned his peanut farm over to a blind trust after he was elected as trump will be exempt from a federal ethics rule that prohibits government employees and members of congress from taking actions that could benefit their financial interests but the president still must comply with a law that requires annual financial disclosures of his assets the first will not be due until may although president filed one voluntarily during his first year in office experts said that even if trump was exempt from some federal

j promise to deport two million to three million immigrants who have committed crimes suggested that he would dramatically step up removals of both people in the united states illegally and those with legal status if carried the plan potentially would require raids by a vastly larger federal immigration force to hunt down these immigrants and send them out of the country addressing the issue in an interview broadcast on the program trump adopted a softer tone on immigrants than he did during his when he called many of them rapists and criminals he instead referred to them as saying they would be dealt with only after the border had been secured and criminals deported but by placing the number of people he aims to turn out of the country as high as three trump raised questions about which immigrants he planned to target for deportation and how he could achieve removals at that scale he wants to deport two to three million got to rely on tactics that will divide communities and create fear throughout the said the senior director of international migration policy at the center for migration studies of new would have to conduct a or raids or tactics such as to reach the numbers he wants to reach it would create a police in which they would have to be aggressively looking for the details are crucial to understanding the approach of a who centered his campaign on a promise to build a border wall and deport lawbreakers on president said he would urge trump to consider leaving in place his executive actions that have shielded from deportation immigrants brought to the united states illegally as children asked on whether he would seek to deport and millions of undocumented trump said his priority would be to remove that are criminal and have criminal we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records gang drug we have a lot of these probably two it could be even three million we are getting them out of our country or we are going to trump said getting them out of our here the administration has estimated that 1 9 million criminal are in the united states that number includes people who hold green cards for legal permanent residency and those who have temporary visas it also includes people who have been convicted of nonviolent crimes such as not just those found guilty of felonies or violence certainly have that many to said m director of policy studies at the center for immigration a group that supports reduced immigration but even if numbers are correct and many immigration activists dispute them it is not clear trump could carry out those deportations quickly without violating due process in many convicts would have to go through immigration courts before they could be deported those courts are overwhelmed with huge so obtaining deportation orders from judges can take many months if not many years thousands of immigrants are serving jail sentences that under current law cannot be curtailed according to official as of only about 183 , 000 immigrants had been convicted of crimes and also had deportation orders so they could be detained and removed quickly approach would in some ways be a continuation of policies has pursued to focus immigration enforcement on convicted criminals in his administration issued guidelines instructing agents to make criminals the highest priorities for their operations in according to immigration and customs enforcement the majority of the 235 , 413 people deported 59 percent were convicted while 41 percent were removed for immigration violations the administration we have already managed to calibrate our policy with heavy emphasis on criminal said the director of the new university school of law office of the migration policy a nonpartisan research group since has presided over the deportation of about 2 5 million prompting sharp criticism from advocacy groups he did so in part to build political support for a broad revision of immigration laws that would have provided a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally under a program known as secure the administration used digital fingerprints shared by local law enforcement departments to find and deport immigrants who had committed crimes immigration and customs enforcement also partnered with local authorities to prioritize the arrest and detention of criminal aliens both measures helped drive deportations to roughly 400 , 000 per year during first term multiplying that number by many times would almost certainly require a program like secure communities and employing vastly more immigration as well as using more aggressive tactics to find and remove immigrants who may have broken the according to of the center for migration studies of new if trump seeks to revive programs of close cooperation between local police and federal immigration he is likely to encounter legal challenges and resistance from dozens of cities and counties that have curtailed or rejected cooperation trump has said he would cut off federal funding for cities that refuse to help federal agents detain unauthorized immigrants during his he highlighted terrible crimes by immigrants he said had escaped detection because of protective policies at a news conference in on mayor a sought to ease fears of deportation and harassment as he reiterated status as a sanctuary city for immigrants is

global investors have rendered their verdict on j trump as sell government bonds and pile into stocks that will benefit the most from a resurgent united states economy from to the united government bonds are undergoing a sharp as investors large sovereign wealth funds and hedge as well as the accounts of retirees restructure investment portfolios to try to capture the fruits of what they expect

gone to positive in just a it has gone to 0 35 percent from negative 0 15 percent and the swiss is now on the cusp of paying investors to borrow money after close to two years of trading in negative interest rate territory if the trend it will signify a jarring philosophical shift from the view put forward by many prominent like the former treasury secretary h that the global economy is destined to stagnate for some time under a regime of low zero interest rates and deflation a series of earlier signals pointed to a move away from bonds in the weeks before the including higher wages in the united states and signs of increased inflation in but what has resonated deeply with countless investors who have been camping out in government bonds for years now is promise to have the federal government take responsibility for stimulating the economy in the form of infrastructure investments and tax cuts away from global central banks does not surprise me that the markets have reacted this said chief investment strategist for asset management in new is a very and we have not had that in a after the financial crisis unleashed an unprecedented wave of activism on the part of global central investors the world over followed the lead of central bankers and loaded up on government bonds until it has been a with global growth governments divided and political risk omnipresent the numbers tell the story according to j p central banks and financial institutions in developed markets are sitting on trillion in or 49 percent of the market for these securities that figure is up from 40 percent in and it highlights the extent to which worries about deflation and stagnation and have resulted in a nonstop bull market for government bonds most and many policy makers as have become fed up with this stagnation trade and they have been calling for lower taxes and more government spending not just in the united states but also in and japan have been frustrated with the limits of

that this new is playing out investors are betting that a pickup in government spending will push up the price of basic building commodities like the price of which was up 20 percent in the last month bank stocks have also gotten a lift because investors believe they will face less regulatory pressures and cash in on higher interest which help their lending margins even the stock price of for has

of higher interest rates and a strong dollar which is exactly what the markets are factoring in right now a inflationary surge could also force the federal reserve to be overly aggressive in raising a dynamic that no investor wants to see the of for a trump administration will be to ensure that fiscal stimulus proponents do not get a totally free hand in addition to pushing for a building cut taxes radically and increase military expenditures that could result in a yawning budget deficit and inflation spiraling out of control for such a dire situation is far from the minds of investors who prefer to see in trump an antidote to nearly a decade of low low interest rates and intense regulatory all of which pushed them into the safety and security of government bonds some even suggest that

is a sense that the cultural and political elite are contemptuous of ordinary that endeared him to who never felt he received the respect he deserved for building such a large political movement that of the as has explains why most of the media and political class missed the rise of trump disgust with the politics of the mainstream republican party burns just as hot if not hotter his animus toward

other consular offices issued requests for to report harassment or as anger stirred by has turned into racial threats and violence in parts of the government has already expressed a willingness to renegotiate parts of the north free trade agreement but to statement seemed a missed opportunity to address the injury that many still feel by stance and the broad concerns about his threats regarding trade between the two nations an opposition senator representing the state of said that after enduring hostile discourse for a year and a deserved a more robust response from their president was a very light response to a very dangerous he said as trump prepared to take he needs to establish its position regarding the united states wall with clarity and are left with a politically light position that say he said settle for a statement that spoke with in in anticipation of a possible trump submitted bills that would strengthen hand the which have languished in the would allow the government to penalize investments in should trump follow through on his promises to tax or block remittances by in the united states to finance his proposed border wall the legislation would also make it explicitly illegal for the federal government to finance anything that could be interpreted as a border and it stipulated that if the united states decided to pull out of as trump has the legislature would review the dozens of agreements and treaties that govern the bilateral relationship in the government is in a difficult place some say their leaders must be careful not to antagonize the new president of the united states with their own incendiary given the economic importance holds in is worrying and frightening to know that the loud guy holding a stick in his saying he is coming to get to beat you is actually in power to do so said a lawyer business have begun the process of normalizing presidency though most executives have adopted a they are continuing with business as usual the rhetoric is very different from the actual business of said the head of the largest business consortium in and the chief executive of which runs movie theaters across the you have to face the reality of governing you have to look much deeper into the to see whether what you are proposing makes buys million worth of goods from the united states every year to run his from popcorn and nacho cheese to audio equipment if free trade were those purchases might be made from other he said few thought a trump presidency was possible now most are banking on a stark difference between

president said on that he had urged j trump to reach out to minority women and others who were alienated by his during the first news conference since trump won the election in a stunning upset that has imperiled legacy are certain things that make for good sound bites but always translate into good and something that i think that he and his team will wrestle said in the white house briefing room did say to as said that because of the nature of the campaigns and the bitterness and the ferocity of the that really important to send some signals of and to reach out to minority or or others that were concerned about the tenor of the and i think something that he will want to also said he thought that trump was entering office with fewer set policy ideas than other think he is said think ultimately he is who during the campaign called trump temperamentally unfit and dangerously unqualified to be has since said his priority is to lead an orderly transition of power to help trump succeed for the good of the country he sidestepped a question about actions since his including his selection on of k a media mogul whose has promoted white racist and as his chief white house strategist and senior counselor copping i think fair to say that it would not be appropriate for me to on personnel said the president remarked last week that comments and behavior had been more statesmanlike since the saying that he had been by the change in tone since the has used twitter to complain about protests against him and object to the way the new times has covered him elevation of who was a top adviser to the has drawn scathing criticism from democrats and some republicans who warn that the is placing a divisive figure with fringe views deep inside the west wing white house officials say has not changed his view of trump since the campaign this when he condemned trump as a bigot who had cozied up to white supremacists and could not be trusted with the nuclear codes but has told the public that he believes the will of the voters should be respected during a meeting on in the oval the president tutored who has no government policy or elective on a wide range of domestic and foreign policy matters he will have to deal with on his first day in office held the news conference just before departing for a trip to and his final scheduled trip abroad as president where he expected to face questions from anxious allies for assured the allies that trump would not win the white house he said on he will tell allies that they should not fear for the future of under a trump presidency in the oval office conversation on trump a great interest in maintaining our core strategic and so one of the messages i will be able to deliver is his commitment to and the
j election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news the banks and the government trump and his allies often describe that system with one globalism it is a word that conjures many none of them shuttered unchecked immigration and a distant cabal believers controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a for and conspiracy theorists is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united said the editor of a published by the southern poverty law center is the globalism is often used as a synonym for the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far the term encapsulates a conspiratorial based on xenophobia and according to mark a researcher at the league a host on the media site rebel explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for in a video she posted in she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president former president w bush and the united nations who value false flag of and immigration from the third almost always sneer down their nose at disdain national laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third she added want open cheap labor and to benefit their business and political and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve the website run by k newly appointed chief white house frequently attacked globalism and during tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than a radio host who commands an audience of millions through his media empire he has been called most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary by the southern poverty law center among his the sandy hook school massacre in was a hoax and the sept 11 terror attacks were an inside job posted his own definition of globalism to in 2014 in his trademark he described it as a digital control engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it total form of the who has enthusiastically supported hailed the republican as a historical figure who appeared on his show last has in turn heaped praise upon reputation is trump said will not let you down you will be very i hope and i think be speaking a so what is trump talking about when he talks about his hope provided a definition in an email before the election last groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold when it replaced communism as an idea that was an danger to the said they have also referred to it as the new world and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly in part because many of foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to said members of the far right became fixated on prominent like the businessman and philanthropist those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a 1991 speech by saying it was the dawn of a world his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot was very easy for especially because he was the one who said to take that ball and run with said that point the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy the multiple meanings have made it a powerful political and and his frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the from the mainstream to the said the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at state professor called globalism defining folklore and narrative for the racist but said it had also a convenient to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be globalism was an important theme in the final weeks of for when he told a rally in in that his opponent for the had sat at the heart of a conspiracy with international bankers plot the destruction of the league criticized the speech for classic conspiratorial talk has continued after the election trump referred to a plot against him again last when he complained on twitter that protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters a trump ally and host on fox business later accused of many on the far right have celebrated election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy last claimed on that trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon ms the trump did not reply to an email seeking comment late night then pivoted to what he thought was most the coming destruction of globalists that hijacked the primarily the news media and international business people soon they would be destroyed once and for he suggested is battling back to restore humanity and to break the he said not gonna be any dtente we know and just here to let you know
this year will be the hottest on with global temperatures breaking the previous set in scientists with the world meteorological organization announced on the announcement is no surprise to climate scientists experts at had already projected that 2016 would be a third year of record heat and the record will not be definitive until early next year but the latest estimate of heat comes as world leaders gather in for the annual united nations talks on limiting the impact of climate change the meeting is taking place in an atmosphere of alarm j trump has called climate change a perpetrated by the has vowed to dismantle the environmental protection agency almost every and has named of the competitive enterprise who has deep oil industry to head his transition team preliminary data shows that global temperatures are approximately 1 2 degrees degrees above levels the landmark climate deal reached by 195 nations near last commits them to holding the increase in temperature to 2 degrees or 3 6 degrees the point at which the world would be locked into irreversible and potentially devastating environmental changes trump has vowed to withdraw from the climate deal it has entered into legal force meaning that countries like the united states cannot legally withdraw for four years but there are many actions the trump administration could take to limit the execution of the agreement that prospect has already stirred alarm among the largest and even a warning from china the meteorological organization found that global temperatures from to were about 0 88 degrees degrees above the average for the years from 1961 to a period the organization uses as a baseline temperatures spiked early this year because of the weather phenomenon known as el which exacerbated coral reef which is caused by water that is too and a rise in sea levels data for indicate that they are at a sufficiently high level for 2016 to remain on track for the title of hottest year on the organization said that would mean that 16 of the 17 hottest years on record have been in the 21st century the other one was 1998 the organization also found that concentrations of major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continue to increase to record that arctic sea ice remained at very low and that there was melting of the ice sheet the secretary general of the noted temperatures above the average of 6 to 7 degrees to 12 6 degrees and at least 3 degrees degrees above the average in many parts of and northwest are used to measuring temperature records in fractions of a and so this is he said of climate the occurrence and impact of extreme events has risen in a heat waves and flooding are becoming more regular sea level rise has increased exposure to storm surges associated with tropical the statement did not mention trump or the united states except to note that hurricane in was the deadliest weather event this claiming at least 546 lives and injuring 438 mostly in the
referring to not new or democrats these labor democrats are conservative people to begin so said the president newly minted chief of speaking about a state like had long eluded the republican party so he said in that is appointed by j trump on to the position in the white first appeared in the new times on sept 2008 leaders confronted by resistance to the headline read the article discusses attempts by union members to court democratic votes during president first presidential campaign and acknowledges certain hurdles they issues of gun rights and race the times sought out then chairman of the republican to offer his opinion which appears toward the end of the proves eerily prescient given narrow victory over in was the first time since 1984 that has voted in favor of a republican presidential the article also offers some insight into who in 2008 like fellow voters this year in lamented the loss of jobs in the proved anything but prescient bigger problem is that has a sort of show pony denying that race would play a factor in the election speeches and the classic double speak and being a great that kind of thing play well in five weeks carried with a margin
last i posed a provocative question on a financial services discussion if the expected overhaul of financial regulations do we still need to worry about planning for the failure of big financial including derivatives that is one of many questions that have been raised by the recent election and the call to repeal the the financial regulations passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis part of those regulations concerned rules for running if not derivatives trades through a clearinghouse or central but a blueprint for what to do if the clearinghouse itself runs into financial trouble and needs saving has been a point of much discussion among those interested in financial regulation answers to these questions are hard to come because although many members of the dominant political party have called for such a the movement that elected the new president is at least in part based on hostility to the which presumably includes the big wall street banks that are largely the focus of at times during the j trump suggested he would reinstate the old rules as part of repealing these were the new deal in force until the late that kept depository banks separate from investment banks and insurance companies a change like that addresses only a part of the broader scope of the overhaul for what do we do about or for some have suggested moving all of what is now covered by the orderly liquidation the federal deposit insurance new insolvency system for big to into the broader bankruptcy system that might but often it is also suggested that these big bank cases should be put in front of district court rather than bankruptcy court judges who serve because the cases are apt to be so politically fraught that would seem to lose most of the benefits of the current bankruptcy which operates as well as it does because of the approach that most of the bankruptcy judges bring to cases district court judges are generalists and spend little of their time thinking about insolvency and reinstating will not address derivatives are we going to go back to the of as my opening question does the repeal of mean abandoning the move toward transparency in these including the use of central clearinghouses and the required posting of collateral to back up these there are a host of questions here for are we also going back to the old system of consumer protection in the financial we will probably have to wait a good while for as the new administration is apt to focus on the more politically charged issues of repealing the prior health immigration and environmental regulations and there is also the matter of the supreme court and the many other judicial vacancies left by the decision to halt judicial confirmations in the it means several more years of uncertainty for the financial industry somewhat just as the industry was finally adapting to the new regulatory that permanence has been thrown into doubt

prime announced participation in the program to resettle central refugees from a camp after attending president summit on refugees in from a surprise in at his little attention has been given to the details of this new policy or about the camp itself this is particularly notable with reiterated immigration policy not to settle any illegal maritime arrivals many of the central refugees will have crossed their borders via overland critics might concentrate on whether this announcement was price of entry to the summit or even speculate it is part of a agenda to woo power player it is important to unpack and understand what this new decision means tangibly for the migrants and us in ban on asylum seekers to us says immigration head read what do we know about the camp in what is the humanitarian migration what are they fleeing and after what does this mean for humanitarian program in have been fleeing serious gang violence in the northern triangle of central el and for is the second most dangerous country to live after as gang members target young boys to destroy businesses and abuse girls and women murder rate is the highest in the world at 90 4 homicides per 100 , 000 in according to the office of drugs and crime the average is 6 2 armed gang members are destroying local businesses the police or law enforcement does not deliver criminal justice no rule of law is in proper place highly corrupt governments fail to protect its violence is not strictly covered by the 1951 refugee convention migrants fleeing from gang violence fear their safety back home but they do not face persecution corrupt officials involved in violence can justify the failure to protect their therefore it is indirect state persecution by critics in the us also said granting migrants a refugee status was a redefinition of a refugee but the administration acknowledged the urgency of this humanitarian crisis where innocent children were targeted by gang has detrimental side effects economic and malfunctioning public including hospitals and are indirect consequences of the state failure to guarantee public safety and personal severe droughts have worsened the conditions in central even there was hurricane in 2016 the flows of humanitarian migrants fleeing from poverty and natural disasters are likely to continue and grow women and children are particularly vulnerable unaccompanied minors and mothers with children have been crossing borders to the us and this the administration announced it would work with the and to process refugees from central on top of the program opened in 2015 at the regional the among nine countries in north and central concluded a series of comprehensive recommendations in to address the plight of people fleeing violence in el and action the government of entered into a protection transfer arrangement with the and the to receive applicants most in need of immediate protection after by the us government in their countries of refugees from the northern triangle of central to the there were 1 , 830 new applications registered in in which was a increase from 2014 among 890 were from the a increase from the previous migrants are in are roman catholic and another are protestant in el are catholic and are protestant in el abortion is subject to jail terms even when pregnancy is caused by rape and the pregnant woman is under age same in are is an innovative emergency resettlement mechanism that can process up to 200 individuals at heightened risk it has undergone its initial pilot phase first beneficiaries come from el and are being relocated to the us discussions are under way with potential additional transit and destination countries this includes over integration and public main reason central refugees want to go to the us is that the richest country in their region where they already have families and friends to rely on they find and survival tips through these social networks which is an important pull factor for migrants for this even is not easy for them to integrate may be an attractive place for central but far away from their countries of origin across the pacific where they may not necessarily have the networks to support them for smooth transition and successful they need community and businesses to offer jobs for their and successful integration governments alone support newly arriving migrants who may end up relying on government subsidies they need community support and over refugee deal is tough for people who have little resilience left read of raises another serious concern for those across central has been as a pandemic disease by the world health which causes birth defects in babies born to mothers with the virus cases were reported in 20 countries in central including the northern triangle the prevalence of gang violence and the absence of proper public health systems in the region make it difficult for health professionals to reach patients and eradicate the disease if the virus spreads further in the migration flows would it means for questioned by journalists at the summit in new denied that there was a deal with the us taking refugees from and island after two the government announced a new us deal to transfer some of the detainees from and to the us difficult not to think of it as a swap deal not a 1 1 refugee swap but a bundle swap we still know in the with trump winning the election and implementing the deal no the faith of refugees in both camps looks quite bleak he may think not a fair deal to swap refugees from with minors from is renegotiating with calling the deal a of speculating unknown details of the deal over vulnerable populations across the we need to think about the consequences of this policy decision in the regional context what we do know is as of they are 1 , 269 including 45 in and new guinea who are mostly genuine refugees they be settled

appearing on that most revered of presidential forums called trump released a video this week describing his plans to great again for and i mean learned not to believe magnanimous but others really want told on that we should give trump opportunity to develop the positive objectives that he may and told an audience in that he wants be respectful of the office and give the an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every forgive because about to pop off have you lost all sense of you and talk as if we have no idea who trump is or what he has been saying for months on end but trump has made it abundantly clear opportunistic words of inclusion notwithstanding that his administration will be loyal to the fringes of the united leaving even the republican establishment running behind announced cabinet choices simply leave no room for imagining a gentler at the helm of the those of us concerned about the fate of the undocumented or the environment or reproductive rights see much reason to worry with the selection of mike and general t to inner circle list reads like a roll call to the dick fan among many other troubling all these men also share a deep antipathy to views are as scary and they are well known pick for national security adviser has called a and stated that is a political that behind this notion of it being a that is not talking about the that republicans frequently invoke but about asked about current republican national committee chair and designated chief of staff told news that are some aspects of the faith that are very i realize that was a scholar of or perhaps even a a renewer of the faith according to popular comes to revive the practice of for following generations or maybe he just said an ignorant thing that would sound bigoted if it were about another religion but today sounds like comments are troubling rather than enabling establishment republicans as a moderating influence on the the trump administration is pulling the traditional down its own giving less extreme republicans about as much voice in this new administration as chair actually worse at least the chair had the good sense to stay quiet my worry extends beyond the realm of what this administration says and reaches into what it will do building a wall on the border is a near physical impossibility the immediate deportation of millions of people is much harder to execute than it sounds but the that can and most likely will secretary of state another hardliner who is in the running for homeland security recently met with trump and was photographed holding his strategic plan for first 365 openly in his hands nobody give this man the nuclear plain for the world to see was the of an useless program of the bush administration officially called and more commonly known as i remember vividly the panic and confusion among the of new city when special registration was first enacted in 2002 this which required visa holding men from 24 countries and north to register with the was a massive failure even the own auditor found the program to be ineffective and a huge waste of resources the cost to taxpayers was more than a year and the program alienated around the world from the united states families were torn apart because of special and the brilliant program netted a grand total of zero terrorism registration was useful only as a tool to disrupt average lives and to spend a lot of money needlessly it served no security function and trump is considering reviving it we can assume because it will make this government like doing on the backs of ordinary then this justifying a registry on fox trump surrogate positively invoked internment as a legal precedent for the program that heinous comparison led the new times to publish an by a law professor reassuring us even if the legal decision authorizing internment has never been we be worried because the judiciary now sees the legal justification for internment as constitutional that whole exercise is nuts the question is not about the constitutionality of internment the question is why the hell are we talking about internment are we seriously working through the legal likelihood or unlikelihood of holding large numbers of completely innocent people in detention racial hysteria led us down that road once to say that panic lead us down a similarly treacherous with or without a 1944 legal precedent beginning to feel like one major terrorist attack from martial law in this and the new administration even taken office yet a fiction in the us that is frequently promoted by the likes of fox news and that had a major impact on this election the notion is that in our multicultural white get theirs while every minority and special interest group gets extra privileges the idea cultivates a mood of bitterness and even if fundamentally untrue many honestly believe that are getting special privileges that some accept will lead to the imposition of sharia law in this country but this is ludicrous want special privileges we just want to be treated the same way that everyone else is treated going to get special registration hardly a fair need more than assurances from trump that thinking about the whole country when he invokes we need to know that equality under the law will be guaranteed under his administration in what we really need to be doing is proving to all that everyone deserves to be treated equally while acknowledging all of our and that the kind of equality that makes for a stronger until that day every one of us needs to be popping off while we because if we there may come a time when popping off is not just useless but illegal pop everywhere you whenever you can pop all

in late trump sat down for a town interview with the candidate at the time was still crisscrossing himself on abortion rights should planned parenthood be was roe v wade settled and made several attempts to pin him you say abortion is a crime or abortion is you have to deal with it under said abortion be do you believe in punishment for yes or as a several trump answer is that there has to be some form of denunciations came almost as fast as retraction later in the trump issued a statement saying that a woman should never be punished for an abortion only her doctor but before he could reverse a cry went up almost in unison from reproductive rights some women are already being punished for having abortions nearly 44 years after the supreme court ruled that women in the united states have a right to a legal abortions are still a significant phenomenon as the guardian reported on every there are potentially thousands of women in the us who attempt to end their pregnancies by themselves some even or these women are operating in murky legal territory only seven states have some law that makes it explicitly illegal for a woman to attempt her own and in most states and at the federal the law says nothing at all but that stopped individual prosecutors from going after women who or in the united a woman who attempts to induce her own abortion may potentially be running afoul of any one of 40 different laws including those against child or drug or practicing medicine without a license according to the abortion legal a project associated with law and this is not settled law

she ordered an abortion drug for her pregnant daughter states have similar laws requiring abortion drugs to be administered by a licensed very much on individual prosecutors to make these said the head of the national advocates for pregnant women which has intervened in some of these cases on behalf of the women charged does not seem like the national right to life or some other group was

with the head of the reproductive freedom recently encountered a woman whose friend had sent herself to the hospital four times by drinking a home abortion cocktail of turpentine and sugar during her most recent doctors threatened to call the police if she tried this said we zoom out on this i do think that there are a number of things going on hospital workers or social workers may be horrified and feel personally said a researcher with these decisions are made on such a local a trump presidency will not necessarily result in an explosion of prosecutions but some predicted it could represent an expansion of the restrictions that cause women to take matters into their own hands in the first place is something that one could reasonably predict in an environment where abortion becomes even or even more inaccessible than it has said the executive director of the national network of abortion has promised to appoint judges to the supreme court with a potential view toward overturning roe v

bringing those problems with us bringing drugs bringing crime rapists and i are good ever a monument is erected to the trump then surely these words shades of will be carved into the marble along with coming out of her bucks a and would bring back a hell of a lot worse than in true demagogic trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many temperate hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled years and years of internalized from a culture that kept insisting on tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these and to be free of freed from this code that was jamming us

conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to the town drunk on the old was

fragmentation of the of and and that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy

for both parties to accept a mutually advantageous trading republicans might happily exchange the monarchy and the commonwealth for a seat in and i think we might feel right at home i do not see any reason why calls the demonstrators a broad coalition of union and environmental in addition to millions who signed an petition to stop the trade express valid concerns without leaks we the citizens would still not know what was written in the treaty only after the continued protest did the negotiators adopt minute changes where is the our read it and everything was in who in the or parliaments understood what was written democracy argument does not hold only the parliament dared to speak out against the deal if everyone in the were chances are a majority would reject the officialdom must think how it needs to convince citizens of the benefits of free what are the benefits for or the common people in the trade deals impoverish the great majority of which is one of the major reason for the ongoing migration major economies became rich without free trade only after their economies could compete internationally did they gradually open their markets the latest example is but so did the

the will of parliament on the basis of a very marginal referendum result on the economic front we have free traders who do not want a free market in even though makes up a significant part of most are just the latest examples of a trend it has been my impression that since the late the western world has been slipping back into a new dark where decisions are made more and more on the basis of

about the rather than hiding behind the that the people have like too many politicians and commentators was it or did really say should ignore the electorate and vote to it seems democracy is only good enough if it suits her particular brand of politics and the rest of the electorate should be led to the promised land whether they choose to go there or for the a after what seems like half a i relished a complete issue of the weekly that did not contain a single reference to trump or i know pay for it next but it was great while it thank thank you i have not read or listened to any news

to read about the rest of the world and nothing about my country thought it was deliberate until i read the life goes on outside the a bold move by the weekly of the then current us presidential

relations despite some softening of sanctions against this country faces an uncertain still subject to continuing sanctions why does tiny a country the us used as a playground and in whose politics

country defeated in the has made peace with but cannot reach a similar rapprochement with a country whose leadership and style of government the seem unable to say the wider gaps in even further suit

shifts are small but in the wrong direction and the survey indicates 6 million hold very or somewhat negative views of pollsters were in the field in and immediately after even commentators were talking about a revolt underway against the elites that was supposed to be transforming politics since become a finds little evidence of upheaval in this survey results attitudes are divided roughly along the same sort of lines as they are in all countries the ones who are going to be most disaffected are those who done as well in life as they would have he certainly not a mirror worrying findings in the 2016 remain more welcoming than almost any nation on earth to immigration the politics of that are unique to this country big issue overseas is border says we have in is rigid border

i just found out that i am four weeks cannot carry on with this pregnancy for numerous reasons and i want to have an abortion though it is an option for me in the united in it is not really an option because the to have it done is simply out of the question hoping you can advise me and are able to help i am absolutely read through her email once again and hovered her finger over the send button the message was addressed half a world away to women on a dutch group that mails abortion drugs to pregnant women who live in countries where abortion is outlawed lives in where abortion is restricted but legal making it one of the places where women on web refuses to mail the drugs thought she would try her luck she had lost her job to and in its place she had found only work her rent had gone up she was borrowing money for was no question that she afford to have a child the question was whether she could even afford an had an inkling that what she was asking for help performing her own abortion might not be fully legal but she was out of answers she hit send then she began to case the for other ways she could cause her own this scene feels out of place in that may be because there was a time in this history when thousands of and abortions prompted calls for the procedure to be legal after the us supreme court established a right to a legal in the 1973 decision roe v abortions were supposed to become a thing of the almost as soon as the court legalized opponents of abortion rights began to whittle them away congress began prohibiting poor women from using to cover abortions in 1976 the largest expansion in allowed insurers to continue to pick and choose the circumstances under which they would cover abortion and allowed states to ban the coverage altogether the two decisions have ensured that millions of women who have sought an abortion have had to pay for it out of pocket and a sweeping wave of laws has closed clinics in many cresting with an awesome force over the last five such a hostile it is no wonder that abortions are still a if largely hidden phenomenon one that even rights groups are only just beginning to grasp one study of abortion patients found that had tried at some point in their induce their own abortions without professional medical assistance another estimated that potentially of women have tried to or at least 100 , 000 kind of

from 2008 to as the economy worsened and a wave of new restrictions choked abortion access around the queries about abortion almost according to an economist who analyzes this crisis of reproductive rights now walks trump as trump has promised to restrict abortion even further he has vowed to nominate justices to the supreme court who might overturn roe v wade because the court is loath to

might happen to some women if roe v wade were overturned perhaps have to have to go to another he said he was asked trump see what we have to wait and see what happens history has already shown us what happens when women in the us access abortion so has the present day in 2015 women on the dutch received more than 600 emails from us women looking for a way to end their own pregnancies group

it their first phone call last on trump spoke to according to the the conversation was warm congratulated the us on his sweeping victory we exactly know how they addressed each but you imagine it might have been and leaders agreed that relations were as put it their two countries would now begin a new based on mutual respect and in the internal they would stay in touch and meet the said hours jets resumed their pounding of scene at some point in spring or summer 2017 difficult to picture you can see the cavalcade of minivans sweeping into the courtyard and parking up beneath a cathedral

when the novel came out in the us earlier this it had every likelihood of sinking without trace it was it was by a young unknown and its main selling point was gleeful contempt for the devices and technology platforms that are an essential part of all our daily lives says individuality like 500 million consumer electronics built by he says at one point to for a of became daily life in where the novel is set along with many of the artists and he found himself driven out by the forces of moved to where now set up his own small and wrote this book a scorching satire of how a few companies in silicon valley have come to dominate everything sink without found a readership thirsty for its acerbic got a rave review in the went to the top of the bestseller charts in and has now been published here by do you actually hate the particularly part of it that i find really contemptible the title is offered like the sneer of a into after just seen a of someone having sex with a chicken or something i hate parts of it i certainly think been enormously detrimental to society if going to be an a not going to come in the form of seem particularly down on not twitter per the undue amount of importance that very serious people put on twitter to is infuriating a social network that makes everyone sound like a and then very serious people take it way too seriously and not how to run a society not how to effect of the curious aspects of the 21st century was the great that and were best exercised on technological platforms owned by corporations dedicated to making as much money as and yet not exempt from your novel is available as an yes we live in a very dark moment where if you want to be part of any extended conversation beyond a handful of you do have to sign on to some things are very unpalatable every era has its unanswerable so maybe the thing to which is what i did in the is to just acknowledge the inherent hypocrisy of all of it though maybe an easy of the things that comes up time and again is the undercurrents of misogyny and racism that seem to have been enabled or unleashed by technology do you think something fundamental about do think it has to be acknowledged that this technology which seems to be really good at enabling misogyny and abuse of women was created in rooms where there were no women the people who seem to be the recipients of the most abuse look like the people who were simply not in the room when all of this stuff was being created if the book does it acknowledges seems like a particularly interesting moment to think about that in terms of where at now would trump have been possible without the course not look who benefits from all the endless newspaper inches about how the oppressed peoples of the world are going to be liberated by technology just been on book tour to a lot of battleground states where i spent a lot of time 10 years ago and if you want to look what looks do a before and after of the with a in between so devastated was it always a wonderful place to probably but was it sort of like a road of ruination and no and i think the has been really good at aiding that certainly in destroying your book made me think that we simply even had the language to the until now that been no outside to the no place to oppose it think the outside is actually i mean publishing in the most platonic sense of the rather than the squalid industry that we have i think that books actually can be anything response to the has been completely but if going to be an a not going to come in the form of claim writers have chosen to ignore the dominant story of the 21st century and have instead rolled over and embraced twitter as a marketing device do you think just been a complete dereliction of from but if you see the literary novels that have been coming out even in the last two or three very few of them have much of a connection to anything now how many of the literary novels published by the four major companies in the us have much to do with a world after which trump wins the have they published even a single i think of need to talk about the of white men read pretty scathing about some of the technology companies you say that the idea that and twitter contributed to the spring is like saying the revolution was sponsored by went to in about four weeks after fell and no one mentioned or twitter what they were talking about was and how they have any at the same i was living in where there were employees who seemed to believe they were bringing enlightenment and freedom to the oppressed masses of the evicting families lived in the same place for 60 years just absurd to think that a social like a happening 7 , 000 or 8 , 000 miles away was being and generated by some stuff some nerds put out on a had to make legal changes to the which done with the device of writing fix where redacted passages such as those about page and how did that come want to delete the text per

they do it whereas there really was a conspiracy it really did new review on on
in the republican party will take control of the us government for the first time since 2005 the switch from being the party of opposition to being the governing party is never easy and the deep

for which he had campaigned so viciously trump lost the popular vote by a significant margin and democrats also got more votes for both houses of congress this lack of popular support puts even more pressure on republicans to craft policies that a majority of can lies the problem party is led not by practical politicians but by ideologues this was not always the case republicans embraced the idea

the us election campaign was a bitter battle that left the country divided while recent figures show of the electorate backed trump and backed won the popular of eligible voters vote at guardian did a for and received just over 100 with saying they regretted not and saying they regret it others were unsure if they had made a the democrats who replied to many said they would have voted if name had been on the ballot republican voters thought trump was not fully qualified for the job many of those who responded said they wanted change and that the electoral college and voting system no longer worked of the us electorate cast their vote for here are a selection of always voted republican but could not stomach twitter a protest against appointments am a republican and have always voted for my but not this year i put mitt name down on the a candidate who running what put me off about trump was the fact he has no clue how to run a country i also dislike the way he treats women and everyone around him he is a charlatan i even think he is a good business person and definitely not smart i think he ever expected to be it was as much a surprise to him as everyone else there is no way he is going to build a wall along the southern us border it would not make because it would not be impenetrable anyone from knows that trump just spewed rubbish and people believed it it matter what he said people ate it up i think he ever expected to get elected it was as much a surprise to him as everyone i bring myself to vote for if there was another democratic candidate i might have voted for their party for the first time ever the problem with is that people stomach her lies and while no one knows what to expect with we know with and are tired of would have got me to vote is quite simple i wanted a candidate to say things that made sense talk about helping everyone and not excluding people nothing too far left and nothing too far right presidents who are able to reach across the aisle and compromise get things done whether democrat or republican i do not have any regrets about not voting my conscience would not allow me to vote for either candidate is a red state so i knew trump would win anyway new regret not i never thought trump would would have voted for but i i thought she would win the white house i feel heartbroken for those disenfranchised who voted for not because of his divisive but in spite of it is a genius but she once to be an ineffectual communicator she could not reach those desperate to put food back on their table i used to drive past the trump signs in my town and dismiss the homeowner as a but my own liberal elitism has blown up in my face they are not they are people with a different experience to and that has swayed how they hope we will begin to understand how trump not their led them to this position but i am scared to death for our for those among us who are in need of care most of for those who cast their vote for trump they thought he was their last chance for prosperity for these the past was greater than the present they remember a time when and their entire extended had jobs when every storefront in their town had a thriving local business there was a stark disparity of views in this and why was the result so because when the liberal establishment of this country drove by trump they had the same response as i from vote for because is a blue so why twitter despise trump and disappoints even though quite and on many issues i would have voted for sanders if i had the chance i am more of an anarchist and not a fan of the us political system at all i wanted to but i know that my vote for as is a blue so why as on the it would have been difficult for me to receive my am not apathetic far from it but the electoral college eliminates the chance for me to make a difference my state is and my vote make it any more blue than it already is my republican vote was also effaced by a sea of blue in according to the electoral college system but she mind her had the last laugh this time i do have regrets now about not voting i am and afraid i fear for the future of my home country and the world i fear for the safety of anyone who is not a white heterosexual male in the united states i am once again embarrassed to be when i moved to in w bush was in and many responded to me negatively because of this i support but the president serves as the face of the and usually quite an ugly face to behold made it acceptable to be an in for eight years that was a bit of a relief now come another sorry excuse for a leader is taking need to take advantage of this historic moment to reevaluate our system in the broadest way possible getting rid of the electoral college system would ensure that every vote counts to get more involvement in the system we should allow voter registration and let former felons vote in every state to prevent the same people getting into power we also need to look at campaign finance reform time to replace the system with a one this would ensure greater representation of our diverse paving the way for real social from wanted over trump i wholly

restrict abortion access and even lead to overturning roe v the ruling that legalized abortion in the us who appears to have an incongruous understanding of how the supreme court had previously suggested this would happen the prospect of overturning roe v wade has set off alarm bells among health who are already fighting to hold the line against an avalanche of regulations meant to restrict

the scientifically unproven argument that after 20 fetuses can feel and it bans abortion before many women learn about severe fetal miller said that above all concerned about the culture a trump

invitation for states north and south have laws that would automatically ban abortion if the supreme court overturned roe eleven states would retain their all of which would take effect after the

in his first televised interview as trump gave a glimpse into his plans for deportations he suggested his administration would initially target 2 3 million undocumented immigrants for people who he branded drugs but even a cursory analysis of target number of deportations shows that he will have to deport far more than undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes the incoming trump administration will try to implement the harshest immigration regime in presidential with his closest advisers making clear they will seek to expedite these deportations and those deported are likely to include a far greater number of those who have lived in the us for years experts even those who are in the us on temporary visas or green us already deports vast numbers of undocumented immigrants during the first six years of his deported two and a half million under the guise of ridding the us of gang people who are hurting the rhetoric was somewhat misleading a new times investigation found that of those deported by the administration by 2013 had only minor criminal convictions or none at all this underlies the impossibility of there simply are not enough people who match his description as serious criminals to and many speculate the targets he wants to reach will mean not only dramatically broadening the scope of deportations to meet but also seriously curtail any oversight within the system important to point out that was actively trying to deport a record number of and even he hit two and a half million over two said grace a senior immigration researcher at human rights us program the idea of 2 to 3 whether or even within a couple of would require a system that really defies our imagination of what a fair system might in the absence of official the migration policy institute estimates about 820 , 000 of the roughly 11 million undocumented migrants living in are likely to have a criminal with only 300 , 000 projected to hold a felony conviction since the administration has actively targeted this cohort of individuals they have drastically reduced the number of interior deportations those involving apprehensions that occur away from the border and usually involve individuals who have lived in the us for years by activating a enforcement this program sees immigration and customs enforcement agents undocumented arrestees picked up by state or local law enforcement who are found to have serious gang affiliations or terror suspicions but even under this new ice data obtained under the freedom of information act by researchers at the university of and reported here for the first highlights that a tiny fraction of total deportations in 2014 involved individuals convicted of a violent while were deported with no recorded criminal history at all to get to 2 to 3 million will mean a dramatic rewriting of who or what is a get to 2 to 3 million will mean a dramatic rewriting of who or what is a and rewriting that definition in a way that involves acts most would not consider to be a said professor an immigration researcher at the university of riverside and author of framing immigrants would also mean considering not just undocumented but people here who are on temporary visas or green cards that have committed minor crimes like shoplifting or advisers have now acknowledged their net will need to widen and have started explaining that the administration will seek to deport not just convicted criminals but also those accused of a crime or gang affiliation as well as those charged with minor immigration such as illegal some have argued that new immigration regime could simply use the tools left over from the deportation machines created by both the bush and administrations but the sheer scale of project and the perceived desire to act quickly will probably require legislative action through congress to enhance and expand the effectiveness of these devices in trump pledged to restore the secure communities the precursor to the priority enforcement which was by both the bush and administration until 2014 the program allowed federal authorities to conduct less targeted sweeps of undocumented arrestees held by local and allowed ice agents to request that local jails detain suspects past their release date in order to allow more time to transfer them to federal detention facilities in the same trump also pledged to expand agreements between ice and local law which allow local police officers to carry out certain functions of immigration law enforcement directly ice reportedly credited these partnerships with identifying more than 400 , 000 removable between 2006 and according to but local law enforcement most notably the county office in were routinely criticized for discriminatory and as a result the administration substantially rolled back their use in 2012 promise to expand or reinstate both these programs is a strong indication the new administration will significantly intensify interior deportations but these removals have markedly declined since entered from 237 , 941 in 2009 to 69 , 478 last as the outgoing administration particularly in its second term focused on deportations at the many of which occur through an expedited removal process that requires no hearing in court this sharpening of the interior deportation machine will leave a number of institutions in the for said conservative analysts close to transition team the trump administration will probably focus on civil immigration proceedings in said president of the federation for immigration reform different kinds of changes that would be made in the court system will include dramatically adding to the number of immigration curtailing review hopefully making some changes to the board of immigration and really suggesting to congress that they limit the definition of said whose is listed as an extremist group by the southern poverty law center there is already a backlog of

has been a backlash against a prevailing wrote rod in the plenty of newspaper leading articles since the referendum have scorned liberalism for its supposed failures at this you may well think i am about to scorn the scorners i am do not share their distaste for liberalism like all good i seek to understand and not to decry and i think and assorted anonymous leader writers do raise concerns that we have tended to ignore it would appear that the fracturing of the as exemplified by and the erosion of the two main political notably is a failure to liberalism now there is common cause between the ideologues of the right and the majority of the working class in two previous one in last year and another in this i attempted to get to grips with the disconnect between the party at and its

working go with her all the but her polemic contains insights that are applicable to the development of the working class anyone who spent hours trudging from door to door on council estates in the early trying and failing to persuade residents to join a party and make as i will the sad truth of was apparent that large swathes of the working class did not have a socialist bone in their bodies it were they turned on by social democracy on the there was a clear lack of empathy for liberal political with overt racism and that more than a generation on from the many people were voting out of habit rather than conviction and many of voting the much derided cap large embracing the meritocratic spirit unleashed in the were eager to climb the social ladder if unable to accomplish it then they were happy to help their children up the not all of and arguably the were necessarily interested in adopting the ethos of the middle class their cultural values remained intact money counted more than keen to earn they were unconvinced that trade unions were much help was giving way to a change grasped by the sun from the onwards and totally misread by the daily there was also a significant section of the working class that was not interested at all in advancement some would not much interested in work famously described by as the they were rare and reluctant although i suspect many did vote in the referendum the party at national level was gradually for want of a better a growing number of its were no longer as working class as the people who voted for them tony electoral success stemmed

arrogance and smugness of the professional then moves on to another point that might well make feminists dignity is a big deal for and not feeling that they have it trump promises a world free of political correctness and a return to an earlier when men were men and women knew their the breadwinner role remains important because many men still measure masculinity by the size of the pay packet

a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the 45th president of the united states of for feminists desperate to see the first female the result was how could someone with such disregard for rights become trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is and by the end of the race 12 different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face form of for having before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes women by the experts and many predicted that lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their to exit of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in of by six percentage points by of black women and of voted for some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women so offended by misogyny that they voted for en mass we interviewed women across to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists what they a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own worker who lives in the much state of voted for trump she describes herself as socially financially independent and educated female i either friends or except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy truly thought video of as been having two and a i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own choices thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities thought it incredibly hypocritical to him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill is and helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this change my opinion about except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a including the presidency was not clear as to what her policies as president would except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe plans for job creation benefits including minority groups i also and have for a long to a more isolationist foreign not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or trump voter a mother of two boys who is currently not calls herself a feminist most but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of a mix of farmland and more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump some things i would be a feminist but it mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality the end of the day video of did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does matter in those senses because looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day all sinners and we all say things like this it uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal even husband had an affair at the end of the my sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media or maybe just simply paid by to make her criminal issues look not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race there is nothing other than whether they can run the country or a which naturally lends itself to traditional twitter republican nominee was knocked out of the presidential heather brown backed trump brown believes that under trump the us economy will prosper and the average will be able to succeed in areas where they are currently home work and finance she says that trump the misogynist reported to really just felt like they pushed a female

and the magazine was shunned by many who felt it went too ipso was freedom of expression means the freedom to offend read the slaughter of 11 employees by two gunmen was a moment of clarity for many it may have got lost in hypocrisy but was a defiant cry that freedom of speech just a pat expression the west takes for granted it is defining value in a there are no other freedoms without has never

democracy such views can be and exposed as but a political point of view should not be banned by the state except for the narrowest of speech is under threat we in the west like to think the threat comes mostly from despotic and that is true the first thing a despot does is to close down arrest academics and journalists it outlaws groups of people it protests and limits freedom of including the freedom of the press one of the many worrying things about campaign was his attacks on critical and his pledge to libel laws to make it easier to sue journalists if they make an group that champions

cultural left has taken up the rights agenda with energy and a sense of righteousness in recent years it has seeking not only to and pressure for change but to prevent views from being to shame those

since becoming the us trump has left some people worrying about their rights he has vowed to roll back on abortion freedoms and deport millions of illegal immigrants with criminal records he has also appointed who has been a as white house chief of the liberties being challenged were fought for and won in the the liberation for battled for abortion to be made legal happened in the in 1967 and the us in in the civil rights led by martin campaigned for racial equality and against how do those who stood up for these freedoms feel about we spoke to activists in the us and the about the and whether they believe what they battled for is now at risk we also asked their advice on dealing with political uncertainty and standing up for what you believe interview includes an assistant to martin who fought for the civil rights movement at he was sentenced to 34 years in prison for alongside nine other black men the conviction was later from am opposed to cynicism too much of that about the election i believe that there are more people in the us than there are those of the i worked with martin king and the southern leadership and later i worked with the national association for the advancement of colored people in the we struggled for voting civil rights and housing rights and we were but our success also brought a reaction how republican candidate got elected in he ran on a law and order campaign so fast forward to today and president election in 2008 in a a of martin king but after eight years it has brought a reaction every time you make progressive steps forward there is a reaction so i am not disillusioned by recent events i understand the counterbalance of not just in the us but also in the trump has both now an opportunity and a responsibility to lead rather than backwards i believe that there are more people in the us than there are those of the same in and but the problem is that people of have to exercise their participation in civic engagement we had a low voter turnout in us this year and when that happens it opens the door for a reaction rather than a more progressive move forward as i i am concerned but not disillusioned because i believe the forces of history will always move towards equality and freedom as we say in the is a constant struggle if you want freedom you have to always stand up for it and push for you cannot just relax twitter civil rights leader martin king with his and colleagues during a civil rights march were a period of social transformation but to make changes you also need to transform the consciousness of people and what we have to work at now i hate cynicism and too much of that about the election result we have to deal with what happened from a much more optimistic perspective in the when we shall we were not overcoming but we sang it because that was our hope and desire we must continue to do to show we are overcoming and setbacks there will always be setbacks and struggle the question is whether we are

that of are still racist that they all voted for while women have gained there is still a large group of men who are more comfortable with men in charge and issues such as access to abortions still create major sexist voting blocs for i believe that most actual rights that i fought for in the are believe that most actual rights that i fought for in the are but regulations will be sent back to

colleague on comment about was only a matter of time before government ministers started explaining that trump is a great really 2016 earlier i quoted from a speech given by lady deputy president of the supreme in she delivered the speech in last but it is only just getting attention now it is here on the supreme speech is about the supreme court and the constitution hale says there is a limit to what she can say on the article 50 because the supreme court will hear the but she does include this suggesting she thinks there is case for saying the government would have to repeal the entire communities not just pass a short to be able to trigger article 50 article 50 of the treaty of the union provides that member state may decide to withdraw from the union in accordance with its own constitutional a member state which decides to withdraw shall notify the council of its intention the council is then expected to negotiate and agree upon the arrangements for withdrawal with the member state these have to be agreed by the acting by a qualified and by the parliament the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question from the date of the entry into force of that agreement failing two years after the unless the council unanimously agrees to extend the period the issue is whether giving that notification falls within the prerogative powers of the crown in the conduct of foreign relations or whether it falls foul of the rule that the prerogative cannot be used in such a way as to frustrate or substantially undermine an act of the united kingdom parliament the argument is that the communities act 1972 grants rights to individuals and others which will automatically be lost if the treaties cease to apply such a it is can only be achieved by an act of parliament another question is whether it would be enough for a simple act of parliament to the government to give or whether it would have to be a comprehensive replacement for the 1972 government is planning to repeal the but after article 50 has been not her speech hale also says there is a case for saying the government does not need legislation to trigger article 50 it would probably be unwise to read too much into but a shock ruling from the supreme court saying the government had to repeal the before it could trigger article 50 and that would be a seismic shock would delay by or even years that is because repealing the will require complicated legislation and there is no chance of getting it through parliament by the end of deadline for triggering article 50 has put out a

it was editor of the new who the situation into a chilling following the us presidential election result speaking on he i listen to black describe i think hallucinating when i hear him described as not not not playing on white not arousing when described in a kind of as someone in absolute possession of policy as someone somehow in the acceptable range of i think hallucinating and i fear for our and i think unreasonable to do so i accept the results of our of course i do at the same i think played a distinct role in this and outrageous and it already you would think that mitt had concession speech buried the on the basis that the peaceful transfer of power a principle trump explicitly rejected before the election required that the nation give him open mind and the chance to was warmer are now all rooting for his success in uniting and leading the country the peaceful transition of power is one of the hallmarks of our democracy and over the next few we are going to show that to the world we have to remember that actually all on one logic is that democrats by true believers in not the right they seek to impeach or recount or rerun an election that principle sets off a chain of responses suggested by reason and if accepting leadership is the democratic then any patriot should line up behind him other leaders of democratic nations should offer him partnership and support the battle has been and the only next stage for a body politic is reconciliation twitter trump and have at white this situation is not normal if you prefer that in social media when women are lining up for contraception in a pragmatic farewell to their reproductive when the chief strategist is accused of enabling racism and when the signed legislation requiring women to hold and pay for funerals for miscarried when the has vowed to deport three million when he has at least 12 allegations of sexual misconduct outstanding against when he has announced a cabinet that includes his own three this looks nothing like a democracy it looks nothing like reconciliation it looks extreme and it in exactly as trump promised it would as he campaigned on a pledge to imprison his opponent his adversaries respond that he probably mean what he a position for which there is precisely no evidence their desire to has put them in the fantastical state of seeing the forthcoming presidency as they wish and not as it plainly is not frolicking in a golden lift with was a man of the same stamp all along the fact that his rhetoric was always so so so euphemistic by comparison with excuse it any more than corruption is excused compared with the the sums are always so paltry twitter snap out of and foreign telling leaders to out of the doom and calling trump a with whom we can do telling us to this is an that is look on the bright liberals the sheer fatuousness of the absence of any discernible or a backbone to put behind raises in me an sense of having been betrayed how was it possible for to

hopes to be the next beneficiary but it is may waiting anxiously by the phone to assure trump she would be his special it is also a single column inch devoted to wondering how this affects our negotiating position when you have a prime minister who will not raise a peep in of you are in a new world its data cannot be fed into old scoops and an engaged everything to know about news read is not the taking a rosy view of the trump it is asking for that view it is trying to fashion a joke out of the you rather your child had feminism or published under the vicious chairmanship of chief strategist i want to see the absurdity of but it is not funny ilk sees a woman on a quest for dignity and equality and wants to irradiate it out of her like living in a john is not anything the extremists and they do not they look for acceptable labels for themselves it is the mainstream that twists itself into conciliatory pretzel knots finding nicer words for such as try to find the fault within ask not whether a racist ask what made the racist so angry in the first place once we have found the right member of the liberal elite to pin it the hate maybe sound so this has a few there is straightforward the first stage of grief trump be that because that would simply be too bad there is a sense that the far right just ignore liberal it actively takes nourishment from our despair the us journalist writing the day after the described his conversation with his be careful if trump his supporters will feel very this was borne out by the spike in racist and sexist hate crimes in the

trump has inconsistent and sometimes views on a raft of nuclear weapons their role in national and international the nuclear threats posed by north and the consequences of their the inevitability and desirability of nuclear the necessity of spending over 30 years to the us and the importance of cutting deals with and others to regulate their is as yet largely unformed in this critical but some of his stated positions and views have the potential to wreak havoc on the international security order and put the country and the world in nuclear there is a promising side to fluid views they could offer ways to reduce nuclear risks and indications point to his cold war interest in arms his interest in achieving rapprochement with and his leanings to be some of these leanings are his attachment to reducing the cost of commitments to and allies while also extricating the us from risky entanglements abroad may well reduce the exposure to nuclear conflict but it may equally regional security and encourage allies to build their own nuclear arsenals instability and proliferation would only increase the odds of regional nuclear which could easily spread across the entire how foreign could test trump 's finger on the trigger read could lower the nuclear especially in relations he clearly wishes to establish a positive relationship with and he should be encouraged to do nuclear arms just as did with his soviet counterpart trump should seek a grand bilateral cuts to 1 , 000 total weapons 2013 proposal that remains on the table for to pick along with scrapping the missile in and that stand in the way of these bilateral pledging to refrain from using nuclear weapons first against each standing down their nuclear and establishing a joint early warning in order to reduce the risk of accidental nuclear of these especially missile are ingrained in republican a test of party purity but trump is no purist or ideologue he appears to have no fixed and seems willing to question premises hopefully he will resist hardliners populating his administration who may attempt to block him from extending an olive branch to the bear achieving a rapprochement with would go far toward defusing the tensions in that otherwise could too easily escalate to the level of real nuclear also needs to defuse the growing tensions with north over its expanding nuclear weapons which is on the verge of enabling its mercurial leader to lob nuclear missiles at south japan and portions of the united states sanctions have not curtailed this threat withdrawing the us nuclear umbrella from our allies will not help on the trump will need to reassure our anxious allies and engage north and china more deeply than ever to stop it if trump can overcome his leanings with an box approach that goes to the heart of the matter the deep insecurity of the north regime then his penchant for defying premises may yield real progress toward halting and reversing this imminent threat he will have the power to launch a nuclear strike at any time of his choosing with a single phone reduce nuclear danger in the middle trump will have to accept that his campaign pledge to tear up the nuclear deal and renegotiate a better deal would in fact not serve the us national or that of he should listen to the professional nuclear the senior generals and career officials who testify that the deal enhances security and averts the proliferation nightmare of enemies getting nukes in also needs to allay nuclear concerns at home as commander in he will have the power to launch a nuclear strike on his own at any time of his choosing with a single phone call if he gives the within minutes hundreds of us nuclear missiles would blast out of their underground silos ten minutes later hundreds more would leave their submarine tubes there would be no they would reach their target cities on the other side of the earth in 30 minutes or large chunk of the not to mention a large global is deeply concerned that trump will command the nuclear giving him the authority to launch a nuclear strike this responsibility requires extraordinary competence and diplomatic skill it requires the qualities of presidential leadership with the campaign behind the hope is that trump can prove himself a leader with a steady hand whom we can rely on to act with reason and restraint in times of on on via on on on on on this content
sometimes i think i have never seen anything as strong as that mean that i like and admire everything about her not here to argue about who she just to note what she did i watched her plow through opposition and attacks the like of which no other candidate has ever faced and still win the popular vote to defeat her it took an unholy cabal far beyond what faced when he was the campaign of swimming with the tide of disgust about the bush administration as the new times the time all the ballots are she seems likely to be ahead by more than votes and more than 1 5 percentage points she will have won by a wider percentage margin than not only gore in 2000 but also in 1968 and john f in twitter concession know can flip that and see that trump was such a weak candidate it took decades of scheming and an extraordinary international roster of powerful players to lay the groundwork that made his election possible defeating in the electoral college took the 2013 gutting of the voting rights act by republican appointees to the supreme court it took vast republican voter suppression laws and tactics set in place over many years it took voter intimidation at many polling places it took the long republican campaign to blow up the boring bureaucratic irregularity of use of a private email server into a scandal that the media obediently picked up and reheated us yet to join ranks of countries with female leaders read took the director of the using that and his power to stage a misleading smear attack on 11 days before the election in flagrant violation of the custom of avoiding such intervention for 60 days before an election it took a compliant mainstream media running after his sabotage like a golden retriever chasing a tennis ball it took decades of conservative attacks on the served as deputy counsel to the senate whitewater that fishing expedition that began with an investigation in a messy real estate deal in before bill presidency and ended with a campaign to impeach him on charges related to completely unrelated sexual activities during his second took a nearly reality the that deified racism and narcissism as essential to success and power as the feminist media critic points trump said and did was framed in a way to flatter and more flatter his the colossal infomercial fictionalized the cheating businessman as an unqualified success and gave him a kind of brand recognition no other candidate had it took the full support of fox whose roger was so committed to him that after leaving the company following allegations of decades of sexual harassment of he joined the trump campaign it took the withdrawal of too many from even that of journalism into the partisan unreliability of sites and bubbles of social took the mainstream of failure to address climate change as the most important issue of our time it took decades of most media outlets letting the propaganda arm create the false framework of two equally valid opinions rather than reporting the overwhelming scientific consensus and tremendous danger of climate change to stop it also took using as a tool of evidently considering his grudge against the democratic nominee important enough to try to aid the campaign of a racist authoritarian now appears to have so close a relationship with that he often appears on the channel and news site rt he tweeted protests when president information was included in the panama papers hack and has been coy about where his leaked information on the democratic national committee came intelligence experts say it came from and made it clear that he favored win the day dropped his the new times ran a story reassuringly titled investigating sees no clear link to with its own underplayed revelation buried the officials have become increasingly based on the evidence they have that direct goal is not to support the election of as many democrats have but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine standing in the world more beef over loss is with liberal young and old read it took a shortsighted campaign of hatred on the an almost hysterical rage like nothing i have ever seen before about any public figure some uncritically picked up outright and spin to feed their hate and rejected anything that diluted the purity and focus of that including larger questions about the other candidate and the fate of the earth it was so extreme that in recent i was attacked for posting news stories on social media by furious people who took the position that to be overtly was to be covertly if the perfect is the enemy of the whose friend is the greater of two a lot of people seemed to think the primary ended the night trump was elected i saw that from climate and others who you might expect would have turned to face the clear and present danger of a trump presidency i for much about failure to address the pipeline adequately which was and but overshadowed by what we heard so little million dollars or so invested in the pipeline and the guarantee he would use presidential powers to push it and every pipeline like it through impossible to disconnect the irrational emotionality from and the misogyny continues since election been hearing too many men of the left go on and on about how was a weak candidate wondered about that word not only because it is so often associated with but because what calling her weakness was their refusal to support her as if sent a pink lifeboat and we sent it because we wanted a blue and now we are very upset that people are as my brilliant friend put it some point soon we need to discuss whether sanders would have been able to but helpful it just sounds like democrats should

zeitgeist he was the first sitting president to visit a federal corrections the first president to oversee a sustained reduction in the incarceration rate in a half and has issued clemency to nearly 1 , 000 inmates over his time in more than his last three predecessors combined criminal justice reforms under but even as the administration has looked to address criminal justice policy at all from policing and prosecution to incarceration and the us remains an extreme among the developed countries on matters of police incarceration and draconian punishment for nonviolent the country remains as

read if there is one theme that unites nearly all of steps towards reform on criminal the limited reach of nearly all his initiatives virtually every step the administration has taken either exclusively applies to federal prosecutions and inmates a small fraction of cases nationwide or came in the form of suggestions and like the recommendations and resources provided by his on 21st

the world is shocked that elected trump as its 45th president exit polls show that the country is sharply divided on trump along the same lines as its sharp divisions on climate ideology was the single strongest determining factor in the election of republicans voted for while of democrats voted for ideology is also the primary factor associated with acceptance or denial of global as climate scientist explained eloquently in this twitter global weirding with episode was the determining factor in the presidential election trump won white voters by 21 percentage won minorities by 53 points minorities are also far more likely to accept and be concerned about climate change than white as bee white bear responsibility for electing twitter full frontal with divide was the determining factor in the presidential election won urban voters by 24 trump won rural voters by 28 points in many cities are leading the way in taking action to curb global voters younger than 45 went for by a while older voters preferred trump by 11 points voters under the age of 30 voted for by an margin young are far more likely to be concerned about climate change than older there is a gender though smaller than many expected despite accusations from 15 women that trump or assaulted and a recording of trump bragging about sexually assaulting he only lost the female vote by 12 points the same margin by which he won the male and approximately the same margin by which beat and among women white women even favored trump by 10 and white women without a college degree by an astonishing 28 points misogyny dissuade women from voting for him they normally favor democratic presidential candidates by a margin of about 20 points more than men also the margin by which women are more concerned about climate change than did elect and then important to remember that as with gore in more voted for than her victorious opponent gore received about a half million more votes than w bush will likely receive over a million more votes than trump bush and trump were elected because of the antiquated electoral college the popular vote was closer in 2016 than in 2012 or 2008 republican voters were willing to forgive many disqualifying flaws they care about his constant lies per cent of evangelicals voted for trump despite his long history of immoral behavior but many voters willing to overlook the scandal of emails and much of support was concentrated in areas like my home state of where she won by over 28 while enough rural white trump voters were distributed across swing states to give him narrow victories and electoral college votes trump won four states with a total of 75 electoral college votes and by margins of 1 3 points or the same reason why republicans control a large majority in the house of representatives despite receiving more than a million fewer total votes than their democratic republican voters are more widely geographically distributed than urban democratic voters has become a that minority being rural white explaining the election result is simple republicans voted for trump and democrats voted for received more but trump won most of the states in which the vote was close trump won in areas with less whiter populations with fewer immigrants in these insulated people fear their way of life is and largely right the us a coal manufacturing country anymore trump promised to change but he and his policies will hurt his voters is changing and not the fault of democrats or but trump made them scapegoats and made empty promises to turn back the clock democrats need to find a way to connect with and help these groups who feel the government on their does this mean for the john wrote last now that the republican party controls the us they own climate change for was the country most to blame for obstructing international efforts to curb climate change our senate refused to ratify the protocol president w bush refused to take any action to cut us carbon pollution senate republicans blocked the cap and trade legislation passed by the house of representatives in 2009 over the past four the us has taken action and shown leadership in tackling climate change as a humans had a slim chance of keeping global warming below the dangerous limit trump and congressional republicans have vowed to reverse that progress the energy page of official presidential transition website focuses on extracting and burning lots and lots of fossil fuels and scrapping climate trump has already appointed a climate denier who wants to dismantle the clean power plan to lead the transition if the republican party continues on this the costs and suffering from intensified heat and sea levels engulfing coastal etc it will be on the do we do the we must continue trying to break through republican science denial many republican policymakers are rumored to accept global warming in we have to change the political climate so that this a disqualifying position for a party leader to take in public there is no reason that republicans have to deny climate science and in the only major political party in the world that and most of their voters support climate action we can donate to and volunteer to help bipartisan climate groups like climate which is working with policymakers from both parties to build the political will to solve the climate problem these groups are now more important than probably be able to limit global warming to but is less damaging than and less than 3 5 or as the renowned climate scientist once climate change will be a combination of and suffering never too late to take action to limit the amount of suffering our children and grandchildren will face due to climate cities and states will have to keep leading the

is first then disenfranchisement if the dominant ideology stops governments from changing social they can no longer respond to the needs of the electorate politics becomes irrelevant to debate is reduced to the jabber of a remote elite the disenfranchised turn instead to a virulent in which facts and arguments are replaced by symbols and sensation the man who sank bid for the presidency was not trump it was her paradoxical result is that the backlash against crushing of political choice has elevated just the kind of man that who has no coherent is not a classic but he is the perfect representation of the beneficiary of inherited unconstrained by common whose gross predilections strike a new path that others may follow the are now swarming round this hollow this empty vessel waiting to be filled by those who know what they want the likely result is the demolition of our remaining beginning with the agreement to limit global who tell the stories run the world politics has failed through a lack of competing narratives the key task now is to tell a new story of what it is to be a human in the 21st century it must be as appealing to some who have voted for trump and as it is to the supporters
trump has done pretty well for someone ridiculed by most of the liberal media as an incoherent babbler his campaigning speeches were just people chuckled but the speeches worked and they did so because trump is a brilliant and careful rhetorician his slogan of renewed domestic glory great won over what was which met exactly the same fate as the remain insipid the language of political discourse greatness and strength are both examples of a a guiding metaphor or image for a political argument it is striking how often trump deployed the frames of happiness and going to be so going to be so he would even as he curried with racists frames can inspire but they can also another we hear a lot about these days the three judges who ruled on the article 50 challenge were called of the by the daily while the telegraph spoke of judges against the even though the decision defended right to parliamentary representation against the arbitrary exercise of executive power this singular has come into peculiar focus since the vote as may said again this the majority of the voted to leave the the now the supposed of the must be respected except and are purely imaginary twitter slogan turned out not to be so strong vote was carried by of the or of the slightly fewer voted for the opinion of the rest of us is unknown the picture of a single with a unified on this issue is a fiction for the same did vote just for more people voted for and about of the electorate bother to vote at is just another to bolster the leave successful deployment of the frame of taking back control it appears the country has a choice between a or a a frame that may seem to the side if one thinks of hard and soft or their opponents if one tumescent are often imposed by means of subtly manipulative language or argumentative idea that should back control of our for dishonestly implied that we had no control over them but the same frame can be invoked by many different forms of words also part of the leave for was the emphasis on making our own laws and reclaiming our sovereignty else we already as evidenced by the very fact we are able to leave the arguments are often conducted as a clash of frames control or security or and successful social and political reforms can be accompanied by clever in the or was the frame was not one of but one of of simple fairness and in this or so it might prejudice was overcome on the other the over abortion rights in is by the incommensurable frames in which the issue is one side uses the frame of life the other the frame of choice and never the twain shall meet twitter the leave campaign the need to reclaim our sovereignty are all around us they saturate political and social discourse some think this is just the way mass political communication is bound to but others say it have to must we always fight framing with or is it time to try something recent it has become fashionable in political psychology to say broadly liberals and conservatives respond positively to different sorts of frame this is one of the ideas promoted by the cognitive linguist whose popular book on think of an became a battle manual for despondent democrats after w second election victory in an earlier moral suggested that a major difference between conservatives and liberals lies in their mental models of the family republicans love a while democrats prefer a this pointed out trump is not some bizarre perversion of republican party on the he played the campaign as the ultimate threatening to ban and from entering the and ready to insult anyone who disagreed with him a pragmatic par as well as a master of political model of liberal v conservative frames has been developed by the psychologist his scheme lists six axes along which people make political value and research suggests that liberals respond more strongly than other people to arguments within the and and less strongly to the others respond more or less equally to all six this is offered as one explanation as to why the frames of strength and group for are traditionally while the left invoke empathy and people that this difference makes a campaigning job fundamentally easier than a as lecturer in political psychology at the university of explains shows that people endorse ideologies because they offer feelings of certainty and she says has been argued that hold a sort of psychological because they provide simpler and possibly less ambiguous ideas on how society should work such ideas would be especially appealing to those who have been feeling powerless or out of and the recent economic crisis or increasing terrorist threats might have made people especially prone to feel this in the issue of abortion rights in the one side uses the frame of life the other the frame of choice and trump campaigns did employ what are often thought of as frames but not only those a professor of political communication at tech and the author of several books on frame observes that both campaigns employed great deal of safety as well as loyalty of the not the not the trump also exploited the frames that supposedly appeal most to liberals think part of that he is also speaking out using the and in other those theoretically owned by his opponents trump claimed empathy for downtrodden while the aggressive moniker however unfair in evidently idea that the right are better at framing than the left has been common since the early but there are differing ideas about why it should be so some people think frames are more attractive to many people because they are simple and easy to understand like think the problem is that democrats have not taken framing seriously
in the town where addressed a shattered nation in trump gave one of the most detailed policy speeches of his campaign last month as the us and the world wait to see which elements of the incoming inflammatory campaign he will attempt to pursue from the white this speech may be something of a guide examines the likelihood of each of the 18 presidential acts and 10 bills trump outlined in becoming checks and balances of the us system will partially constrain as with any us president but the supreme court is likely to soon have a conservative justice once trump takes and congress is controlled by his fellow republicans state governments may resist some of the next initiatives by taking his administration to stances seem to shift after win read trump will also have great leeway to act on his in line with precedents set by w bush and to expand the powers of the executive text is drawn from campaign site on the first day of my term of my administration will immediately pursue the

keystone which he ruled against after a state department review found it would not significantly create lower the price of gas or break us dependency on oil imports as trump will become the only leader of a large industrialized nation to doubt climate a crisis which even leaders such as the and have pledged to act on trump could simply ignore the us commitment to the climate though withdrawal would take four years he has appointed a climate whose organization is in part funded by coal to head his transition and could also try to gut environmental though he would face a fight in the within agencies and from states such as ambitions to resurrect the coal industry face a larger problem than environmental safety decades of economic driven by the boom of natural gas his promise to water and

sixty million voted for each for their own reasons some were simply angry or afraid others were indifferent to all the outrage directed at their eager for change above all else welcomed permission to vent dark feelings of resentment towards people not like them all were alien to a coastal cognoscenti which decided long ago that this election was a foregone the commonly agreed rules by which presidential races are it even close democrats clung to a consolation prize that although they lost almost all the key electoral battleground states on received 600 , 000 more votes overall because her supporters were concentrated in more populous cities a less reassuring way of thinking about this is that supporters were more evenly distributed in the places that most closely reflected the diverse political reality while were huddled together in leader attacks campaign for taking vote for granted read new swing states became more familiar to me over the course of two at least 100 rallies and tens of thousands of miles on the campaign trail the primary and general elections took me to 24 including a year embedded with and once he travel with and trump it meant i lived and worked for much of this time in 10 states that determined the eventual north new and in and the roads to or all became almost as familiar as national airport and the beltway were back home in and new i rarely met anyone who thought could possibly lose out on the i rarely met anyone beyond the often sparsely attended official events who was enthusiastic about gave up looking for explanation among army of pundits and academics at first it was embarrassing to be constantly told i was naive to question the eventually it was just annoying that they seemed incapable of understanding what voters saw in sanders or trump when i had just come back from rallies packed to the rafters with adoring fans talking to reporters on other newspapers was sometimes difficult if you wanted to conform to the required nonchalance of the modern profession on the where we helped take turns as pool it was heresy to contemplate her loss out loud even at the back of the there was open contempt for his quixotic tilt at the democratic editors and columnists were more easily persuaded something was up when the primary results for both parties started coming 22 wins in total for a democratic socialist from a near clean sweep for a reality host who met a demographic he the there was no new surge of or women voters coming out for in disgust of just a shortfall of several million white working class voters who had turned out for but chose to stay at home this lots of republicans who proved far less appalled by their candidate than they were willing to tell the supposedly hidden minority proved impervious to sophisticated sampling techniques and poll modeling yet finding trump supporters outside the beltway was never difficult one reporting trick was to go to the car park of a home improvement on a midweek a guaranteed place to find underemployed white men with time on their hands to talk and nothing to loudmouth a at a depressed former steel town near the border between and one retired carpenter summed up the cavalier mood as he stacked lumber into the back of his for a deck his wife had requested think trump is but love to have him as president to see what says an carpenter who previously voted for photo posted by on may 2016 at think trump is but love to have him as a president to see what said tucker earlier this year want to end up in some kind of war or he added pointing out he had no regrets about twice voting for something is going to change if is president we just know it alone not an chief warns trump read men of a certain who had watched the certainties of small town prosperity vanish in a it was hard to conceive that things could get any short of nuclear even little that trump had to say would shock them but plenty of women felt the same way a young professional i met with her husband outside a trump rally in was mainly frustrated that the republican candidate chose not to defend his outbursts more would like him to a and i say on my mind but i hope what comes out of my mouth take away what really fighting she said have never heard him say anything that was directly racist or against women they were like comebacks for someone attacking him trump intended to be as racist and sexist as he sounded is a separate question that deserves more but many are now reassessing the recent remarks on the subject of another controversial investor peter think one thing that should be distinguished here is that the media is always taking trump told the national press club shortly before the election never takes him but it always takes him think a lot of voters who vote for trump take trump seriously but not so when they hear things like the comment or the wall their question is you going to build a wall like the great wall of you exactly are you going to enforce these what they hear is going to have a more sensible immigration is little doubt that trump can be both crudely inarticulate and a consummate communicator at the same time during his awkward first meeting with on he provided a textbook display for watching you followed the remarks as they are written in the official the president elect was talking gibberish discussed a lot of different some wonderful and some he said of his meeting with very much look forward to dealing with the president in the including counsel he explained some of the some of the assets and some of the really great things
as of the nation reels in the wake of the election of people around the world are struggling to figure out next as protesters take to the climate scientists issue dire and immigrants face down fears of some people are wondering whether the states will truly ever be united many in the us and around the world fear the taking to bed and streaming while drinking wine a particularly effective way forward for the country for guidance on how to move past and we asked those best equipped at knowing how to laugh in the face of pain and comedians having a twitter while i am not sold on the term i am still going to use it i am going to my sense of social responsibility and remember that everyone has their own unique and to have compassion before vitriol i am not but if i may their term for merely this i may decide this is the time for my global time to finally see or live in a have to move forward no matter what because that is the nature of political cycles i think in our best interest to process all our emotions as they come and then remember that positive change just happen every four it happens all the time and this a just a roadblock and evolution are as vital a part of democracy as compromise and precedent for i will be replaying clips from the simply to exist in a bubbling hot tub of denial once i move past probably download seven more guided meditation and commit to more flax in my diet inevitably going to be bumpy so might as well keep both ends of my body on have to get back out twitter i have little wisdom to share today it feels dark scared what i do know is that i have a voice and a platform and so many others whose lives will be affected by this election do not though today is a i have to get back out there i chose my job because i wanted to make the world a safer place and starting tomorrow allowing myself a i will get back to work when you are join fall for the same old twitter the only answer i have is for me to get back to work i tell anyone else how to deal with it not black or gay or a woman and i know the fear in their hearts after something like this i can read all the articles about how poor whites who voted him in because in ravaged rural communities and they see any change in the last eight years so they were going to vote republican no matter about holding the media and news companies accountable for reporting on how about fuck the democrats in the first place for every swaying the nomination away from my answer for getting over all maybe fall for the same old shit news outlets can go to can we laugh we because we always will i laughed at jokes about on be fine comedy is indestructible you destroy it just like a war on terror you destroy a concept or a feeling send this to them look how righteous i am i have to go tell jokes in times fucking square tonight back to for those who have a twitter i think being about the situation is the first step totally understandable to feel dread right but more important to not let that dread incapacitate you occupy your mind with being vigilant of the oppression around you it has become so easy to justify oppression in our and we need to be ready to stand for those who have much of a voice right now there are a lot of citizens nervous and scared right now i feel like helping in whatever way you can to and strengthen will also help yourself to cope trying to find ways that make it easier for us all to listen to each other is a fantastic endeavor right way to move forward that i am personally trying is to inject more logical thinking into my comedy material it seems as a country right we are leaning more on emotional response and less on logic to make our decisions comedy is great because it can help condition people to think more critically about things without it coming off as forced comedy can disarm and open people up to new ways of thinking rock and his for seem like there are any easy answers to fixing all this right but weed is more legal now so roll a grab your and look to the must be twitter comedians are surviving this election the way everyone else only a little bit easier get me this quite the most disastrous thing that has happened to me in my entire life my anxiety is so bad physically incapable of being depressed i got up and took a hike this morning who am it because i wanted to feel good it was because i literally wanted to stomp on something as hard as i could and i decided the thing i was going to stomp on was planet earth i would die to change this outcome if i could truly i have no unfinished business on this planet been on had some great i did i saw the that being of all the feelings had today despair one thing not feeling is block not a silver just a fact i take for granted that in this i am luckier than the other people living through this nightmare i get to make jokes and pound my fist and get and because a comedian and because a person who was born in this not much of a chance this presidency will affect me even with even a fraction of the force with which going to devastate everyone else i have no advice i know we need to
2 another big week for me and my cancer they but so and things are really hotting up before the us election got a good show managed to persuade piers as one of the few journalists who actually knows trump to speak to us from his car while filming in for and really interesting about what the media have understood about the piers is also one of the people from the worlds of journalism and broadcasting many of whom if honest i really claim to know especially well come forward to make my life easier they know this or by offering good wishes and positive thoughts and if my experience is anything to go if you know anyone with a cancer diagnosis hesitate just drop them a line to let them know thinking of them genuinely appreciated show went i but still suffering from occasionally quite acute fatigue i blame the as i get anything like this in the course of seven cycles of also since the really only able to sleep on my back my kingdom for a pair of can i hear despairing partners the doctors reckon this might be because of the impact of the radiotherapy on my which been by the well with the malarkey except that at around five on morning i get the first signs of an unmistakable and potentially very painful condition kidney i was first diagnosed with them more than 25 years ago and every now and again since a new one would get stuck in my kidney and kick off a bout of the name given to the excruciating pain that can come with them this time a couple of painkillers see it off but stand if you can face for what happened a few days 3 first day on the new treatment and one having to pay and my first visit to what one of the nurses laughingly described as otherwise known as the patients medical day so at there i am being shown into the discreetly hidden from the regular day unit be visiting later for my infusion and guess it looked very similar to its and while on the subject of business the seats were actually staff were of and i got my first dose of the very expensive plus per which the currently treatment was first class as previously no problem with the principle that i should pay for as the should be protected from additional unfunded treatment costs i choose to avail myself of but i still struggle with the royal taking a markup simply to supply an already very expensive drug by the is already standard treatment as part of chemotherapy for my cancer in the us and charging a private day rate as a whole day for a treatment that takes just over an hour taken to calling it my very own for scandal i hope putting the money to good which is perhaps something worth looking having received my i was escorted back downstairs to rejoin the rest of the human race in the and do you aside from having identical seats to i think there might actually be more space down but time to get reacquainted with the as its name is a rubber cap attached to a refrigeration system that rapidly cools the thus reducing the risk of hair loss that some chemotherapy drugs otherwise more or less guarantee it work for but it really worked for me over seven cycles of to be a few quizzical looks from other patients more used to seeing women using it and the endurance test that is the first 20 minutes of wearing it as it literally freezes your scalp brain freeze and multiply by was a very small price to pay of course forgotten how hard it would be and very nearly took it off but in the end the name of the new machines they now have at the and a from the staff got me though it so i still have hair on my 5 would turn out to be one of the most difficult since i was diagnosed back in march and none of it to do with my cancer or its metastases directly for a i have been suffering with constipation of cancer patients once it gets to 5 or 6 days as it has for me can become almost painfully uncomfortable then there was the discomfort under my right ribs put down to my liver playing up more another hangover from the radiotherapy and to cap it all was the recurring renal colic from my kidney stones and their appalling sense of timing and the twist the painkillers a mixture of paracetamol and codeine tend to work less effectively over time make you more cut a long story was a bit of a perfect in increasing discomfort and waiting until enough time had elapsed to allow me to take more painkillers which no longer quite do the and make the worse as a i leave the house and have no desire to eat or drink and the latter set to provide the biggest twist of all 8 at for blood tests preparatory to the next dose of new due by after such a dreadful i can add extreme fatigue to my list of ailments dress and have to sit slightly for a rest blood tests show sharply declining level of which means no for me unless they recover doctor also spots that my blood pressure is pretty low and i get when standing up and so prescribes intravenous fluids to 9 at looking forward to radio 4 today same thing happens extreme fatigue and dizzy when i stand up decide might not be possible the by the have been nothing but support itself over the course of my cancer travails return to hospital for more iv fluids i think these are probably the consequences of the radiotherapy taking my appetite for and drink and my simply not drinking
trump has promised to build a wall along the border between the us and after his electoral triumph over many are wondering whether actually pull this or any of his other controversial along with many other minorities in the were railed against by trump during his campaign in the to the he vowed to rid the us of yet despite this adding to his record of xenophobic trump was elected the 45th president of the united states mapping the trump 10 countries and regions feeling the heat read real estate billionaire promised to scrap the north free trade agreement on grounds that it at the expense of us workers he has also threatened to tax the money sent home from the us by migrants to in for the aforementioned spoke to in the us and about the election of and how they think his presidency might affect their lives what they underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on feel dismayed and deeply disappointed as bad as that the worst part is feeling powerless we have a say in an event that can have catastrophic consequences to our economy in the us we are seen as collateral damage even those opposing trump seem indifferent to the economic and human pain this situation can inflict on us i understand the economic pain that people in the rust belt are feeling successful trade agreements transfer some jobs from one country to another but are net job creators to all involved countries under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt north gained and the south has but this is the result of failed compensating measures within both countries boosted wealth across the subcontinent cutting ties with will also harm the us it surprises me that during the campaign no one pointed this out and perceive that trade is a game under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt it surprises me this was n't pointed as trump adopts a pragmatic the damage can be limited to a further decline in my purchasing power owing to the peso devaluation and a difficult business environment while expectations are better anchored if he feels obligated to deliver on the promises made to his voters and revokes things could be much worse our government has little leverage because underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on them they are self absorbed and busy inflicting pain on one another of will probably send us into an even deeper power trump has over over our over our our perception of our freedom of over the way the world will see us is terrifying and he is not even the president we woke up to find the exchange rate at 20 50 pesos for the dollar we went from 18 70 per dollar on election to 20 20 yesterday and 20 50 today expected to reach 30 by the end of the year we have been humiliated in front of the deportations of many who live and work in the united who send money home and who contribute tremendously in that way to our economy will probably send us into an even deeper recession his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever see we 're surprised how many love adore are more than willing to welcome in any who wishes to make their home for the next four bring your come live bring your help us out we are a welcoming country with amazing fantastic great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and we hope they will seriously consider it that goes for people who want to escape the our collective the democracy was something to aspire to the spell has been broken in many ways in even the least educated among us believe this man to be a buffoon his ideas are uninspired and poorly that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen we are surprised by how much and how many love adore are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology will now inspire this we ask has created a dangerous stereotype of in the have a visa and i can travel throughout the us whenever i which is a lot but i am concerned of the increase of hate or that as a result of the stereotype i live in a place visited by a lot of tourists i worry that they will think that i am or that they think i am a drug dealer or a is not fair that a presidential candidate has blamed because of issues they have he has created a dangerous stereotype of in the us there are a lot of undocumented but a lot of us are living legally in the us many drugs go the us through the but what they forget is the us is the first drug consumer worldwide what they say is that they are in part responsible for the drug cartel violence in some we make jokes about it we now say that we are no longer the country with the stupidest president in the world silver lining is that perceives trump as a common politics in can find common ground to make front to his politics and maybe force the common efforts by different parties before the 2018 presidential election i really hope margarita will engage in alliances with other parties to win the will suffer irremediably if trump imposes tariffs on imports renegotiating for example or tax the remittances the fiscal situation in is already strained owing to low oil prices and corrupt politicians with vast regions of the country in hands of or crime trump adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt politicians like president and the foreign trumps adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept

northern trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will the shit out of but including appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes will he will he cities where

abroad no more closures because of cheap imports no more sales of great companies to foreigners no more stagnating wages no more immigration it may be that there are jobs and great prospects aplenty in the burgeoning tech and service sectors in the big cities driven by global but they care they are hurting and nobody has taken decisive action to help them the votes for trump and mark the end of an era and a new dark age of protectionism and will insist that this is a travesty of their they want to access more global trade and not be they crazily by the confines of the union and its bureaucratic inability to cut aggressive trade deals with the rest of the world they live in a dreamland if they feel that the rest of the world is more committed to free trade than while membership did not hold back from being among the major any apart from the promised closure of borders to that is not what their voters as always better understood than any of his allies he cordially despises voters in south and the west midlands want the same as their counterparts in and after it was those three with their tiny 100 , 000 vote which gave trump the electoral college votes for victory he might be a but he or at least styles a workers benefit from free trade and as he has consistently said for 18 in the teeth of opposition from the republican mainstream who remain free traders his as he called wants to stop both exchange and intermingling are the lifeblood of that along the border was one of the most insistent chants at his along with the forced deportation of 11 million illegal immigrants but more importantly for the international trading trump wants to withdraw from the north free trade agreement between the and which he casually dismisses as the trade deal in he also wants an immediate halt in negotiations for both the transatlantic and trade agreements and unilaterally he wants to impose swingeing against the rules of the world trade from which he is prepared to on which account for half of the trade deficit per cent tariffs are promised on imports the remaining 20 agreements the us has signed are to be reviewed or abrogated the impact would be killing by exposing the already enfeebled as inciting and trade retaliation and the entire global system of trade and say that trump the president will be much more cautious and realist than trump the his talk on trade should be seen as threats to produce more fairly balanced not a tearing up of the world system maybe but there cannot be a complete divorce between campaign rhetoric and policy he believes what he says and nobody in his close coterie is going to urge caution not his senior trade who has promised a potential in the first six months of the trump from every major us trade deal if it cannot be shown actively to benefit the us era of trade deficits is he says will but otherwise we put tariffs has said trump will go to ground on every trade such as the one with south that the described as and wants to revoke trump has already given a commitment that on day one he will declare china a currency manipulator as a precursor to introducing up to tariffs on positions are not they represent a deeply held view that the us does not need trade except on terms that put first the idea that successive administrations have negotiated deals loaded in the us interest is impossible to concede because how else would he explain the rust there can be no concession that jobs are disappearing with or without trade because of and automation the of the and has disappeared for ever and destroying the international trading system is not going to bring it of that cuts any ice with a demagogic populist trump has promises to keep to a that expects no less the last time a republican president and his party controlled both the house of representatives and senate with the same convictions on first trade was 1928 there were warnings that introducing the tariffs on imports in 1930 would trigger a but first republicans could not help themselves and the democrats were too weak to stop institute for international economics in predicts that if trump raises tariffs on china and and they then us growth will stop in its tracks for at least two years the prospects could be even worse if trump goes further already world trade growth over the last year has
set your alarm clock on 20 trump will take up residence at 1600 the most stunning acquisition in the history of the modern world in the time of transition between then and the apprentice president will be taught how to use the nuclear codes he will also participate in a simulated a war game designed to better his understanding of how the white house deals with the a as for many in his own his election is the black swan event of a generation a serial bankrupt will be at the wheel of the largest economy a man with no experience of elected office will preside over a government machine with 2 8 million civilian employees and 1 5 million military personnel a man who will be pursued into the white house by a pack of lawsuits will be in charge of the a man repeatedly described as unfit for the office by senior members of his own party will be the with his finger on the trigger of more than 4 , 000 nuclear warheads a man who knows little about the rest of the world will become the most powerful person on the planet of told pollsters that he lacks the temperament to be but he is going to be put in the high seat way to deal with a shock of such magnitude is to try to reduce it to more digestible proportions by telling yourself that it will not be as terrible as first feared this is how some of the humiliated political establishment in the us are trying to cope with their nightmare some here and elsewhere in are also trying to process their horror by telling themselves that he can be controlled they to the idea of president trump by telling us that a man who bid for power by trampling over democratic norms will be constrained by the traditional boundaries once he has office on this comforting account of the the terrifying trump of the campaign trail will morph into tamed trump the most optimistic types even conjecture that he might evolve into a version of highly scary to much of the planet when first but a president who ultimately ushered the world towards a peaceful conclusion to the cold war twitter what will be the first actions trump takes as being an optimist by i would like to think that the rosy view is because if he unleashes a fraction of the things he has he will be calamitous for and the planet but there are multiple grounds for about the sanguine view of president trump to believe he will turn into some sort of benign figure repeats the mistake constantly made as he marched on power some of those saying that he will be caged by office are the same people who said that no candidate could ever secure the white house by disparaging and so many segments of the electorate yet get there he has orthodoxy contended that no candidate could prevail by trampling on so many democratic among them threatening to lock up his opponent if he won and refusing to concede defeat if he lost yet prevail he did having secured the white house by shredding so many it takes one hell of a leap of faith to believe that he will now be controlled by the traditional trump wins presidential plunging us into uncertain future read reason to be doubtful of the tamed trump thesis is the nature of his mandate he has made the ritual noises of conciliation that follow every election by saying he will seek to govern for but those hoary sound especially empty coming from his lips he did not gain ascendancy on a promise of unity and but by running on a platform of rage and bigotry he was the most presidential candidate of my is already an epically divisive president before he has even take the inaugural oath this will be compounded because the is a building without concrete foundations he lost the popular only gaining the white house thanks to the eccentricities of the electoral system just one in four voted to put him which is worth bearing in mind whenever you hear anyone calling this a or a teddy dubbed bully of the presidency can give its holder enormous sway over the emotions of that nation at times of a president can cool passions or inflame stoke divisions or try to bridge them i think we already have clues aplenty about what president trump will do with the bully pulpit there are compelling reasons to be fearful about how a man of his temperament will respond when he fails to make good on his many undeliverable promises his impulse will be to try to displace the blame by unleashing the demagogic furies against minorities and foreigners his election presents the most serious challenge to the international order that has prevailed since of his more prominent supporters have been telling the world that it can relax because his wilder statements and more outlandish pledges were not meant to be taken seriously it was just a comic routine you know he is a take comfort in that he has indeed flipped and flopped over a host of but on some themes he has been as constant as the northern star he lies a but he does not lie all the time there are critical policy areas in which he should be taken both literally and seriously he is an economic nationalist he has been clear and consistent about that and over many years when he told that it had been by cheap imports from he believed it and so did his voters that was key to his victories in the rust belt states in the are getting excited by the idea that he will a sweetheart trade deal for they should have a cold shower a trump presidency will not be friendly to the free trade on which so much of
it is no use pretending presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it at least in a victory for prejudice and for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of will ultimately confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be explanations have been offered for defeat last week all have an element of truth for she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past not least in respect of the foundation in many she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an sense of entitlement there was her ambiguous legacy and was a reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her the complacency of the democratic party and liberal too comfortable after eight safe years of did a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation for the most did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then with to give him too easy a these factors contributed to demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white men and women who comprise of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns the determining factors were not education or not religion or not sexual predations or entanglements they were race and linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all suburban and that inclusive and was not working for were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its moorings as frank said in these pages last democrats went from being the party of town in to the party of vineyard of the and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan great what he was really saying was white when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a when he minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their the subliminal message was always the fear of the foreigner in conjured the illusion of a return to a society of secure safe and agreed values no wonder and other minorities are frightened no wonder us relations around the globe are in turmoil and populists and hard are celebrating no wonder observers speak of the end of the west and the demise of liberal democracy has stormed the shining city on a betrayed the founding fathers who stood tall for human dignity and universal rights and now presages an isolationist made in image a beacon of discrimination and are the peculiarities of the electoral system to too won a majority of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in 2013 when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of 1965 by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting such as south to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the what has been happening in north a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black who disproportionately there were numerous other examples across the including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the leader of the free world to allow voter suppression is beyond supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that like the billionaire is much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no says he will cut raise public spending and slash the federal deficit impossible all at once trump says he will renegotiate or scrap and other treaties but his conceit that this will help uncompetitive in or in is says he will slap swingeing tariffs on but he knows the geopolitical and commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make strong and its then kowtows to the most formidable strategic and undermines he says he will be best friend but his campaign was not above antisemitic trump voters really believe the border wall they need a reality check the power of us presidents to act unilaterally in or any other domestic is extremely circumscribed trump would face endless legal challenges and he would need agreement and funding from prospect that much of what trump has promised or threatened will not happen is welcome perhaps the responsibilities of office will temper his worst producing a the incoherence and contradictory nature of his economic ideas for boosting growth and jobs and moribund industrial areas suggest his grassroots supporters are destined for disappointment economic performance is what will ultimately define the trump has plenty of other horrors in while volatile personality and inexperience add extreme at home and to a host of other worries trump now has the opportunity to stack the supreme court with
dogged by the migration crisis and the traumatic business of to name just two existential challenges to their project those who run the union felt they had enough on their plates before trump seized the white of his triumph broke on as had that of the vote to leave the union on 23 in defiance of opinion pollsters and the assumptions of political elites that maintained that the most advanced democracy could never deliver such a blow to the established order then it where they had preferred to dismiss as a revolt by the most difficult election prompted the same elites to question their easy assumptions and for the first the morning in a senior member of the with experience of service at the highest levels in and said of his worried about what would happen here but now i am concerned

demagogues on opposite sides of the and a wink at the long shadow of soviet history that still hangs over the with trump and commitment to protecting the in question for the first time in it seems to

for 240 has toyed with the idea of a woman becoming president this for an all too brief it looked as if the idea might become a reality but the dream of a female president has remained just a disingenuous myth occasionally serves up in but never permits to spill into its facts instead of witnessing the landmark moment of a woman moving into the oval we can now see the misogyny that became a feature of the 2016 presidential campaign bedding down in the corridors of power when trump called a in the final only a few days after a series of recordings revealed him admitting to a series of sexual aggressions and many people thought it was the end of his bid for the presidency social media during election night revealed trump supporters male and female voicing the view that a woman is simply not capable of being too weak to stand up to foreign leaders and the sucker punch for those of us who believe that this particular woman was spectacularly more ready for the white house than her grossly and abusive opponent is that as has historically been the case once a female candidate did not carry even the female vote a staggering of white women voted against and for the man whose statements and attitudes brought kicking and into the light twitter concession speech in conceded the she tried to offer hope to the especially the young of know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass but i know someday someone and hopefully sooner than we might think right of we may not think that right because right now the media is focusing its attention on economic and racial it is not interested in the of but that is also the story of this which was fought over a series of myths and outright two solid the media engaged in spreading and misinformation about the first serious female candidate for president for a few days after we learned that trump likes to grab women the the mainstream media began admitting how many of the derogatory stories swirling around were how many were literally fictions but then the and the story reverted to its misogynistic relentlessly informing the electorate that is untrustworthy it was character and it who still believes these claims are factual and on the some 59 million people do should consider how closely they resemble the stories that have always been told about female both real and fictional to do so is to that it is time to stop as some commentators are that failed us the truth we failed understand a you must know its stories taking a hard look at some of the tales told about the idea of a female president can teach us a great deal about this as well as those to come the women who have become presidents in the history of fiction are not quite as vanishingly scarce as they are in but not exactly numerous until very the fictions were as presumptively white as the candidates just 14 women have mounted a serious bid for us three of whom made it to a major national although only one secured that nomination five became third party and two became major party running both of whom lost we have had three female secretaries of one female speaker of the house but no woman has ever been elected to the executive branch of the idea of a woman in the white house has always prompted the same it is either a a disaster or a cheat was endlessly called to shouts of her although her crimes always varied had she murdered or had she covered up wrongdoing in the deaths of at stolen or was in it matter what mattered was the idea of illegitimacy most stories imagine a female president who murders or sleeps her way into or inherits the fictions about women becoming president have always worked to invalidate the very idea for the novel by a former speaker of the house and avowed enemy of newt which tells of a woman who becomes first woman president and chooses politics over national resulting in a style its now has been tipped for a cabinet because propaganda neither history nor fiction are there more than a handful of stories that imagine a female president who could ascend to the highest office in the land through merit and hard instead she either murders or sleeps her way into or she inherits the from a man fictional depictions of a female presidential candidate on the actual campaign trail are even this may correlate with the fact as herself she was always more popular in office than while running when female presidents are they are in office thanks to a of some which is also power was handed to or she inveigled her way into it either crooked just like fiction is a club into which women presidents admitted they are segregated by cropping up primarily in satire or science female presidents are a or exist in an alternate reality women are disproportionately more likely to become president in disaster movies and because only when large segments of the human race are eradicated do we imagine women in charge in early science fiction the apocalypse often took the form of the nullification of as real political gains sent masculinity into an imaginary crisis from which it has not the any writing that considered the possibility of a woman president focused not on what it would mean to but on what it would mean to men even when written by a woman what seems to be the earliest fictional depiction of a female presidential candidate was a burlesque provoked by the first woman who ran in beecher published narrated by a man who thinks he supports rights until he meets who wants to be president her name your says it she is aggressive and a unwomanly amphibious loud
they said he wrote music to slit your wrists which in this week of all weeks feels timely as it i never felt that barb was fair to his songs often told of gloom and defeat and but his voice was one of consolation of sharing the loss by finding another who felt it of discovering the glimmer of love or light that might get you do we need that now died on slipping out before he had to glimpse the news that has convulsed the world he saw a lot in his 82 but he never had to see the words trump with his impeccable spared himself that ordeal but his songs anticipated how the rest of us would feel and put differences aside in first white house meeting read and their sycophants outside the us taunt those of us who are fearful says we need to get over our collective and embrace the new reality smith says was a cold fish and glad to see the back of him chooses to describe first black president as a arrival could even be a good they he might offer the a decent trade is not only pathetic in its to a bigot when the moment demanded some of the moral steel shown by who extended her hand to but only on condition that he accept basic human values including respect for the minorities he had so copiously insulted it is also unforgivably myopic it fails to see there is a much larger picture here it is not hysterical to suspect that the world we have the postwar order that provided relative peace and prosperity for seven decades spanning the lifetime of generation is or as ambassador to the us put in a tweet later is the end of an epoch the world is crumbling before our twitter protests against trump continue across us those who share his anxiety have in mind is the system that has allowed us to take international stability for to regard it as the natural way of since to that order has been free broadly along with a sturdy international designed to allow nations that once fought each other to resolve their differences diplomatically instead it has consisted of an alphabet soup ranging from the and to the and and myriad others and not that popular to say so underpinning it down to patrolling the shipping lanes that make global trade has been the leadership of the the last foreign policy types have fretted that this was under threat their worry was that a rising as it grew more would overtake the us but that it would refuse to take on the obligations attached to being the leading power what few envisaged was that the threat to leadership would come from the us in the form of a president eager to shake off the duties shouldered by his country since that is what a trump presidency augurs he is opposed to free a protectionist bent only on transactional deals in which wins and the other side loses trump has no interest in spending us capital diplomatic or financial on upholding a global system that heaven imperfect but at least aims to benefit everybody twitter an estimated 10 , 000 protesters gathered outside trump tower in new on 10 paramount team have that one of his first acts in office will be to cancel the accord on climate change to reach that agreement with took years of effort by the and would soon have started reducing the carbon emissions that are choking our planet it will take just a a stroke of the for trump to destroy it he has threatened to do the same with the painstakingly brokered deal on nuclear weapons but what i detect in those distressed by election are more intimate concerns so many have do we explain this to our how do you raise a child to believe that lying is when a compulsive liar has been rewarded with the biggest prize on very first words trump uttered in the oval during that encounter with that was almost too painful to were a lie was a meeting that was going to last 10 or 15 he boasting that the session had overrun in the meeting was scheduled to last an say that never but trump did not pay income tax for two decades he cheated his fellow depriving them of the money needed to pay for the basic fabric of society and he has prospered what do you say to the child who trump was right not paying taxes is of daughters were looking forward to pointing at president as proof that there was no goal beyond their reach now they can only look bitterly at that photo of new times journalists preparing the front page that was never published its planned madam will somehow have to as my colleague freeman has pointed how one of the most qualified people ever to run for president lost out to the least qualified and they will have to tell their sons that it is never acceptable to grab women that even though trump did it and bragged about it and was rewarded with the votes of tens of millions of we tell our children that never but trump did not pay income tax for two will have to find a new way to explain why racially charged insult is even though it has been and endorsed from on high already are reporting incidents of abuse never experienced just as ethnic minority did after the

observers cite voter anger at an entitled political establishment and an and privileged gridlock and dysfunction in international and economic dislocation and distress to explain his victories in the primaries and now in the general not wrong over the course of the trump threw fuel on all these still more critical to his he nailed the white male support that would put him over the top in electoral votes on by his continual attacks on the legitimacy of the first his targeting and denunciation of undocumented immigrants and and his overtly sexist remarks about after writing a book about his and his i think other factors played a pivotal a trump family culture of ruthlessly pressing any stretching the and pushing the legal and ethical envelope to the max immigrant who operated restaurants in gold and the amassed a nest egg by offering miners food and proximity to his father greatly increased the family fortune by exploiting loopholes in new deal government subsidies he tapped to construct housing in and and trump used a loss of borrowed money and four corporate bankruptcies to build a global brand and avoid paying personal income taxes for nearly two family culture also includes an adherence to the theology of author of the 1952 bestseller was the pastor of marble collegiate where parents attended where trump and his sisters and where funeral services for their parents took place in his the supreme importance of a notion that trump has not merely embraced but with a approach that has more than fulfilled his own fierce injunction to be a in every pursuit among many results are a remarkable litigation history according to as of trump had been involved in more than 3 , 500 including dozens that are still active and a political campaign by an unprecedented level of venom and trump has also contributed his own special flourishes linguists found trump was second only to in terms of how feminine he his hair for years it has been a highly effective a bit of vanity that made him the rather than a remote and on the campaign his coiffure made him the perpetual of attention as with the traditional circus big red bouffant blond cued audiences that at any moment he might do something and that it was permissible to even if some sort of antisocial activity a this includes antics like hitting people with a baseball bat or dumping water on their for it was likely to be a vicious a preposterous even a suggestion to rough up that would ordinarily be considered unacceptable but was now even because it could be explained away as a a or one of phrases success may have hinged on his voice am your he declared in his acceptance speech at the republican national convention in and there is more to that claim than might have been apparent at that me lay it out despite his obsession with showing that he is the most powerful person on his speech have the archetypal this is as the reported during the linguists found he was the second only to in terms of how feminine he sounded when measured by cues like facial and statements posed as he came in as the most feminine of the entire perhaps even more it is also because of the way he sounds although shown more than capable of shouting in classic more often than not what comes out when he opens his mouth is not traditional talk in contrast to both the of van and the chilling rasp of speech tends to be in the middle even slightly high pitched not effeminate despite his guarantee in one debate as to the adequacy of his genital not verbal tone might seem unimportant at a meaningless distinction overshadowed by his relentless aggression and braggadocio in other not a big its effect is a big deal instead of insistently bellowing or pounding his chest like an tapping into a different the strongman who tosses off some of his most devastating comments with a malevolent sneer think or who make their point not by shouting going to blow your head off but by hissing that better cooperate if you want to see another speech is hardly bristling with complexity his vocabulary is extremely almost to the point of being and his use of incomplete thoughts and sentence fragments has an is this combination the hint of menace beneath the surface added to what appears to be an unpolished immediacy that millions of listeners take as evidence of authenticity and spontaneity the way he talks reminds them of the voice inside their own heads a rich and sometimes dark stew of conversational snippets and memory random phrases and by it somehow seems as if hearing the voice inside his the way trump talks has been evidence of his lack of of of especially compared to explanations of her but to his it is proof positive that he is the real deal not not not hiding behind a mask of calculation and manipulation for fear of they keep their own interior mostly banal but sometimes in but they admire in some envy trump for openly expressing a deepest self that seems to mirror what they think and feel but dare reveal to the with almost uncanny trump launched his presidential candidacy at a moment when technology provided him with the perfect megaphone for his verbal in the form of twitter its limit reinforces the sense of urgency and the impression of seeing directly inside his head and glimpsing unvarnished sentiments and emotions even more than the substance of his it is the apparent even of this inner voice that makes his denunciations of strike such a powerful there is nothing authentic or spontaneous about what trump everything is as even a casual look at his rallies on repeated continually this impression of having a direct line to what actually thinking is proof to his supporters of his underlying honesty
it was only a matter of time it was inevitable it says something about human 48 hours of the election of a protectionist and isolationist us president commentators are working hard to things told he do what he he will turn out to be like he will get good the anger that elected him was understandable the truth is trump represents a break in the strategic leadership the world has had since president has talked with sneering contempt about democracy itself his not accepting the election outcome impossible to imagine that or or would have belittled allies like south or japan or epochal what a trump presidency means for the pacific region read explosive of the new us president has planted a trade war at the heart of his a tariff on imports from china and a repudiation of the trans pacific partnership which was supposed to have been proof positive of pivot to was catch unconsciously a the aviator who was the front man for isolationism before the second world this is not business as usual a historic shift the trauma is not about to course the us will be sending diplomats and to offer assurance to nervous but the truth is this a different knows whether isolationism or will dominate in the final foreign policy mix or which from fox news will be appointed to run diplomacy and policy but sick of the costs of and empire the people have voted for a different world role would be foolish to lapse into alliance invoking mantras what has a and in his first consequential foreign policy rang the leaders of japan and south to assure them of continuing alliance support it will not dissuade them of the notion that is now playing with isolationism after the man due in the oval office had toyed with the idea that in any attack from north they could be left to look after themselves as the election haze china conundrum will become clear read first contribution to a pacific an increase in south and who believe they should be because cannot be relied especially with north its missile important is how quickly trump can discard his promise of a tax on imports from china the notion was given to him by a rogue professor peter at the university of been described as the only economist on economic team others apparently being business people who donated and several autodidacts from the far right of the republican an account in the new yorker said views on trade and china were so radical that impossible to find another economist who agrees with has written several trenchantly books and trump has boasted of reading the coming china where they will be fought and how they can be thesis is that trade is a game in which one party loses and one party wins it was his idea that a tariff of should be applied to imports from china apparently to terrify the country into reducing its exports to the united states opined that multinationals will their new factories to cities like and this is a fantasy which in the new yorker said shatter general all of the music the entire state of which exports more goods to china than any he asked why would any multinational corporation forced to leave in the face of the return to the us when they could go anywhere else in the to begin and export from there trump is advocating nothing less than a trade growth since 2008 has come from china no economy is more dependent on china china takes one third of exports plan to slice a few percentage points off economic growth would likely tip into recession business would try to stop him yet he has to keep faith with his base in the industrial states so what measures might he retreat during the campaign he assured them he was going to bring back industrial jobs by beating up china and so we one can looking at a suite of measures trade war by another needed is strongly worded advice from allies about the fragility of the global economy and lunacy of a global trade 7 30 interview this week was a challenge to to see our alliance in a more prosaic realist not romantic a he just and should not be viewed as a tablet brought down from on high with behaving as grateful to be in the glow of going to be interesting to watch make the adjustment to an in decline i has been a veritable industry and inventiveness is capable of proving all wrong but consider it this championed by the and technological driven by has devoured industrial jobs in the manufacturing states the system has not offered anything to displaced workers as a result they revolted and made an isolationist and protectionist their new that is not a confirmation of decline i know what other symbols we should be looking it autumn in the country suffers from huge fissures of class and education the cities vote the country votes republican the democratic party is no longer as that which held the white house from 1933 to 1953 or even that of and an alliance of the rich and and the citizens living on food stamps its nominating convention was filled with testimony to identity politics without a mention of factory closures the republican party is the new labor buoyed by the enthusiastic support of the white working class its president has an agenda and was elected by delivering racial taunts at the greatest historic failure in life is the failure to repair the damage of slavery and many policy arguments like policing or urban planning boil down to 7 30 worthy

will trump destroy read shock may have started to but the despair is just beginning for the aftermath of the us election feels like being in but perhaps in that detached way we feel when a beloved musician or actor dies goodness knows had enough of that this wretched it was not our trump is not our president and yet it does affect not just in whatever economic impact is to or because the care less about climate change the seeding of fear and the misogyny that has been the attacks on our most this affects us all it is to get to work even from over here you could retreat to a but fighting back will probably make you feel as activists learned that when society and politics i spend too long grieving about the dying of the argues the social justice activist harry smith only way i feel injustice can be defeated is by staring evil or indifference in the face and have come back tomorrow and have another go at nobody can live as long as i have and not have faced much disappointment and loss so when i encounter things like the madness of or the election of i mourn for a short while and get back on my bike and figure out how i can lay seeds in the imagination of people for them to harvest a better in many he allows me to give purpose to the suffering i endured along with my parents and my siblings fighting for social justice allows me to connect with younger people who are and people who are and that allows at to feel i am still part of the human and activism can bring personal benefits there are four areas the institute for volunteering research looks says its research manager social and cultural capital human the ones we describe are personal such as growth in confidence and young people leadership roles it can also result in transferable skills public how to work in a team if we look at social especially if people become more engaged and we look for new networks and which sometimes leads to greater involvement in the local twitter long as there is breath in my

appreciation of other cultures and interests with economic depending on the it can be linked to better volunteers are more likely to see health effects studies have suggested that especially older people who volunteer live longer than those who but the question is do they do so because of things like getting out of the house and having more physical but certainly wellbeing the sort of outcomes like are reasonably part of a movement for social change is an altruistic says activist peter who has been campaigning for 50 years do get an emotional uplift to participate in a campaign that changes your and the lives of for the better but it can be very frustrating and dispiriting when change takes a long time to happen you need to be psychologically ready for the long twitter protests against trump continue across us will be aggressive and pedantic critics can get very unless you steel yourself to be ready for those says kept me going for the last 50 years has been a vision of what society could and a series of successes along the way always taken the long view when up against great historical very unlikely to be remedied overnight we need to be prepared to think in terms of years and in extreme decades working together with others in a campaign is mutually reassuring and empowering knowing not alone will give you the strength to carry on despite delays and has kept smith going is firm belief am years short of 100 years so i know how long but as long as there is breath in my body and memory in my i will always stand for social because one day we will get it right and even i am not there to it will still be worth told the truth about trump just as she should read what can we you may not be able to join or donate to the but there are other practical steps you can take some are extreme you could consider boycotting the us some are not so extreme you could certainly boycott such as his golf courses in and without experiencing any could turn your attention to the us

representative m thinking has overstayed its future of the democratic party begins with cleaning house at the democratic national committee without a dynamic progressive committed to a strategy leading our party and a staff committed to humble outreach and genuine advocacy for needs we are doomed to repeats of 8 once represented the working class not any more read platform may have been the most progressive in but the people felt it enough to have a good plan on paper we now have the chance to build a that wholeheartedly supports that platform and turns it into our guiding our next leader the thinking and strategies that have defined the top levels of democratic politics have overstayed their both with the party faithful and with the country as a cannot rely on the same social media messages and stale talking points that got us here nor can we fall for the dangerous notion that if only talked more about privatizing social might have won over more moderate voters there is no evidence that such triangulation has any credibility with the and our party needs to recognize that once and for unusual ideology has taught us that many of the political fights ahead of us have nothing to do with the arguments of the past 20 years party leaders need to recruit candidates with a genuine understanding of the issues that matter from economic insecurity to the future of rural to social justice to education we need to work with grassroots organizations to build a fresh party for the future just putting fresh paint on the party that lost the white house is not an t have to make a positive case to voters of democratic party was dealt a body blow in this election educated and white voters especially in places along the rust belt have fled the democratic party they voted for trump in record numbers to make matters 6 million voters chose to stay home as underperformed with virtually every coalition demographic the we is not an easily block twitter demonstrators in new city protest election victory the soul searching begins some will say the party must become more progressive others will say we must refocus on the white voters that drove the presidency in the and yet others will say we must continue to focus on engaging and mobilizing the coalition we must reject the false choice of having to choose between being more progressive or cultivating a populist economic message or continuing to fight for the causes of our increasingly diverse base we have to do all the three we have to make a case to every voter of color of what we intend to do to improve their lives because simply pointing to the intolerance and bigotry of the republican party is not enough the we is not an easily block the soul searching must reject stale conventional political wisdom and outreach strategies and embrace candidates and alliances to move the party forward we must own a message of economic populism that embraces not just the white working class but workers in the economy that have been left behind and who feel like the recovery from the great recession has not reached them we must do more than commit ourselves rhetorically to reforming our criminal justice system and our immigration system we must more fully commit ourselves to reforming both systems we must be responsive to the voices in the country that are fighting to ensure that life in this country is valued our party is old and stale the greatest asset we had going for us was that we saw the demographic changes in this country and elected a candidate that reflected that change and he gave us an affirmative case for change the job is to mobilize its supporters to the and we failed its time to must stand up to those who have too much love this country and i am worried about it why i think the question cannot be should democrats do to but what must we regardless of do to secure good secure middle class safe drinking water and respect for all regardless of race or we must do is take on what called the princes thirsting for in the late control over government itself they created a new despotism in its service new mercenaries sought to regiment the their and their my three of the privileged hedge funder mercer and venture capitalist singer and spent millions of dollars using populist language in attack ads against me as welcome their trump presidency a for the warn climate scientists read thrives when everyone is lying about and as democrats as citizens we must be more we must name the names of the modern from peter to to who are using chump change to play with local elections and national must stand up for water and stand against abuse of eminent where the worst kind of corporate power teams up with governmental power to take land for dangerous fossil fuel projects we must stand up for unions not just before an stand up for prevailing speak up for project labor stand up against misclassification we must unapologetically oppose the merger as a reckless concentration of and push where we can for breaking up the stranglehold of big big and big agriculture in other we must be honest about and truly stand up for those who have too little against those who have too much must follow the lead of sanders and you drive through the rust belt states that handed trump the presidency states like and you see a people in profound economic crisis the only jobs are retail jobs at or the dollar or if you are really a job at the local hospital the costs of and childcare are skyrocketing credit cards are maxed and college is a pipe dream the epidemic of drug addiction is destroying whole families no one must look to for hope and lessons on

thanks everyone for taking part this and for all your comments keep the page open for longer but we are heading off been a long hope everyone enjoys their and see you next about that question from earlier 11 2016 says that it was may who called trump talked to trump earlier on a downing street statement said it added that the prime minister called congratulate him on his election campaign and and confirmed may had been invited to visit the us soon as he did n't call but she called in the know colleague seems to have more guardian staff 11 2016 were being told today by one of the senior who is trust on this that it works that way world leaders frantically phone him and they choose who to put through 11 2016 mean everyone phones the new us president at the same time and he chooses what call to take first and trump talked to another ten people before talking to think find a substitute for my 2016 in a week that feature a great deal of there was one topic that unified the divided nation the outrageous changes to the shape of our beloved chocolate the most read list on the news site was reassuringly marks then the us election the people know where their priorities lie got to be honest i always thought that was something that people only ever bought in a panic at airports if forgotten to get someone a gift when they were abroad 08 2016 always thought they made triangular so it fits in the of it unify us for long there had to be a just got real via argued that it summed up easy to scoff at the fact that it takes food to act as a focal point for what is happening in this when there is so much that has been truly awful about this hate the immediate retraction of a promise of extra funding all of these things should be more alarming than a slightly smaller chocolate or a pricier snack but all of these things have become part of a ominous collective sigh that has summed up the past few months 2016 has been defined by a creeping sense of dread that all the progress humanity has made over the past few decades if feeling particularly might be about to then she was writing in the golden era before trump was elected and we found out that had died in a week that brought us closer to had our own reasons to feel that droning mix of fear and a inquiry concluded that the austerity policies amounted to of disabled rights the work and pensions dismissed the scathing report as and to disabled people which is because say the conservatives telling paraplegics and cancer patients that being forced to pay the bedroom tax whilst having their disability benefit cut and social care removed really as bad as you is the definition of and offensive been a lot of talk of a possible future president in but this reader see 11 2016 astonished to see people quite seriously expressing hope that will run next time all the stuff about writers hoping to tell their daughters that they could be president just like was undermined by her surname dynasties are part of the this article suggests it likely to happen is unlikely to run for president read more world leaders have begun congratulating trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president was the first global leader to speak to trump on the phone he was also one of the first to congratulate him publicly after a meeting in new in where he met both trump and he described trump as strong trump in turn called fantastic victory has divided society some are relieved to see who they believe supported the brotherhood lose others are and fear the repercussions of his win as part of a community project we asked people in to share their thoughts with us what they was more than thrilled by his win as a fascist be concerned much with the state of human rights his support will directly result in more bloodshed and more violations of law and human rights in the controls the most powerful office in the this will give a huge push to all the in the world talking about the extremist terrorist movements electing an as a president is going to feed more and more the image those movements are trying to spread about the us as the biggest devil in the and will further inflate the violence and terrorism this will only help increase the instability and the warfare in the and maybe the whole live in a police state where activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of but i doubt administration will do the same this is evident from our current eagerness to connect with and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by and while trump is openly hostile to and clueless about the policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her more tolerant and inclusive is it time to take a step 11 2016 was elected he was practically hailed as the second coming of remember it people crying in people hugging in the the world was going to be a better fairer place what absolutely the same old same the rich got richer the poor we have the situation in it looks like the have elected the and its going to be the end of the will have to wait and but i think that neither one is so bad or the other one was so good w response to the news this week was one of the most simultaneously heartwarming and
trump has won science and scientists played almost no part in the campaign scientists must consider how they fit into a trump future this be easy many scientists are scared in the tribal world of us many now find themselves on the outside looking in most university scientists are and the 2017 house and senate will all be republican for this nothing portends disaster more than the elevation of a opponent to national and international of the competitive enterprise to oversee the transformation of the environmental protection those academics who lean republican of whom are since you would despise rejection of what a w bush adviser once dismissed as the anyone interested in evidence over speculating on details like who trump will ask to replace john as his science scientists should not just be asking what trump will do for them they should face up to the difficult question of what they should be doing for trump some scientists will have to join the white house itself when w bush was his administration had a hard time finding a scientist willing to serve as his science advisor when jack a highly respected administrator and physicist who was also a took the job he was excoriated by his peers and excommunicated from some scientific circles we see hints of similar responses to election already earlier this week the physical society issued a press release congratulating trump on his victory and encouraging him to sustained and robust funding of scientific research a top the received so many complaints that it felt compelled to retract it and issue an apology some have already written off science advisor for of state university not sure science would because there be any science get much except when it gets in the way or bolsters support for a political was called a upon taking the position under bush there are thousands of political including many science that will need to be expert advisory bodies constituted and and experts put into staff positions under the white house any scientist who agrees to hold their nose and work with the trump administration should expect much of the same criticism received by such as government will not have much choice but to engage that is their job the rest of the scientific community must still ask itself some difficult questions we suggest money all that the late stages of the presidential 69 prize winners endorsed and pushed for more funding for research and policies that support the scientific workforce they suggested that there were other reasons for their but focused on what the next president might do for the interests of the scientific incoming president of the geophysical union expressed a similar a fear that the scientific infrastructure in the is going to be on its everything from funding to being able to attract the global leaders we need to do basic science trump imagines that the scientific community could cause him one option would be to do what did to reactionary doctors in setting up the and their mouths with trump could echo promising to science to its rightful by increasing funding it would be the art of the and it would put critical scientists in a difficult position no one knows what trump will do on science or much else the history of us science funding shows that republican presidents more eager to spend on than their democratic priorities have with democrats spending more through the environmental protection agency and commerce while republicans spend more on the national science foundation and national institutes of health overall spending on is not with party mainly because science funding has long been a bipartisan priority other than the massive injections of cash through the and smaller stimulus package more science funding has remained pretty stable as a proportion of government discretionary spending since the end of world war two without much discussion of the fiscal trump has announced grand plans for increases in us infrastructure investment for this could mean funding for perhaps newt will revive his vision of a moon base and a mission to mars the demoted since the end of the cold could receive a boost that advocate for more science funding have already sought to tie in funding with calls for greater investment scientists need to consider how to react to possible increases in funding as well as express fears of decreases in doing they might position themselves as representatives of the public good rather than just another special interest group should pragmatism trump how should scientists engage on policy issues such as vaccination and climate where republicans are often accused of being or at war with despite rhetorical nods to the social conservative wing of his party during the campaign and his enthusiasm for convenient conspiracy he is clearly a pragmatist with little worry about changing his policy should therefore ask themselves whether they would support policies that did what they regard as the right but for the reasons policies focused on deploying electric vehicles and nuclear or wind power may be justified in purely economic rather than environmental terms environmental regulations may provide convenient cover for the taxing of imports as the struggles to justify a new protectionism when it comes to climate maybe the pragmatic business of policy design might finally take precedence over trying to convince a republican congress to see the world through a climate eyes two days after the election a spokesperson for tweeted the strong support of the agreement on climate change many environmental scientists have long seen as antithetical to their cause would they make peace with big oil in order to defend the or will the battle against perceived enemies of science now take place on multiple would be easy for scientists to bring back an opposition strategy focused on defending a on much harder will be for the science community to support a government under the control of president trump and a republican congress choices will have
world leaders have begun congratulating trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president the order in which trump spoke to leaders around the world has sparked speculation as to how he will shape his foreign policy in the 24 hours after his victory trump spoke to and south the may was 11th on the action planned after second night of protests across us read was the first to have a conversation on how to closer diplomatic with the us prime discussed regional security and how to defeat a key promise in election campaign but although the and the offered they his leadership a of asked people around the world to tell us what the situation looks like from where they how their governments are responding to victory and how they think his leadership will affect their and the us will probably grow closer but as citizens we will suffer from endorsement of our live in a police state where activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of but i doubt administration will do the same this is evident from our current eagerness to connect with trump i hope he hires a team that understands the complexities of the middle east it is evident he does n't have a and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by and while trump is openly hostile to and clueless about the policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her more tolerant and inclusive gone through a very similar election scenario in in 2012 where both candidates were i was not very surprised by the outcome the democratic party underestimated popularity and the dislike for i feel a lot of votes went to trump out of spite for perhaps if a different candidate had gone against trump the outcome would have been different just like what happened in it looks like the population is now sharply split in with each side the other i think the most dangerous thing that can happen to a intolerant people in power might make it easier to challenge them as they are now out in the but healing the rifts in society is much harder i simply hope trump will become a president for all us as is his and reign in the hateful extremist tendencies displayed by white hope he hires a competent team that understands the complexities of the situation in the middle east and as it is evident that he does not have a trade conflicts but he will use his business wisdom to deal with feel great about the result a tremendous win for the for those who were constantly ignored by political elites in i like trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct us is divided probably more divided than when i worked there for three years that happens when you are obsessed with gay rights and minority rights but forget to promote the most basic right of living a better life for the majority he will be a great president if he improve some of his to plot and the are now dead trump is likely to be a more pragmatic figure than so relations will improve going to be some trade conflicts if trump lives up to his word about but i believe he will use his business wisdom to deal with it china will have an easier situation and a stronger influence in the region a cooperation between these two countries could benefit humankind i wish that trump could be more presidential he will be a great president if he improves some of his rhetoric i hope that he can get along with have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from say the result was shocking would be an understatement victory of an fanatic like in a country known around the world for its liberal virtues and is something that adds to the swerve of the world to the right he adds on to the list of politicians such as in in and of in maybe we are witnessing the gradual transition of the world into a global we have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from parties another moment of jubilation for them maybe the consequences for foreign policy will be beneficial as trump has publicly shown his admiration for and his way of governance but his temperamental nature makes trump truly so we will have to wait and see as long as he turn rhetoric into i think the world will be southern where most of the people have a similar opinion to me but in the northern areas of the stomping ground of the ruling opinions may differ the philosophy of of a mutual peaceful which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime is something i firmly believe and the rise of a person like trump is a question mark on existence itself the hidden silent majority that is supposed to have created this ruckus may not be as silent as they are portrayed to be as in every other some are always bound to feel during the rule of a government they which could be for cultural or economical reasons beyond doubt this result was the result of what they call some sort of racial hate storm against the former policy on terrorism and the domestic election helped me to see what the us truly is under the pop culture disguise they have a huge rising tide of fanatics and a population desperate enough to find hope in them maybe his campaign of rhetoric and hate was a charade to reign in their support as long as he limits himself to rhetoric and dare turn rhetoric into i think
a us intelligence officer operating in a dangerous part of the world prepared this week for presidency by making a pact with a they resolved to disobey any order to commit two pledge reflects a wider debate within the national security as some officials concerned by authoritarian inclinations debate whether to quit in protest at his electoral victory or to remain at their post in the hope of

national security bureaucracy was sufficiently resilient to check presidential overreach while congress passed a law in 2015 designed to prevent a return to human rights activists have long observed that torture was illegal before several wondered if they would be able to serve in a trump administration if instructed to transgress moral or legal boundaries meant to protect civil rights and liberties twitter what will be the first actions trump takes as public faces of national policy are the cabinet agency chiefs and their immediate deputies below them are the political appointees who comprise the senior ranks of government their choices are made for them during inauguration and the transition of they leave to make room for the picks made by the those tasked with implementing policy are in no such to the functions of the most they are formally apolitical and provide expertise and continuity across administrations several of those who spoke to the guardian described themselves as reeling from an electoral outcome they did not anticipate and the imminent arrival of a president they considered manifestly those who expected to shock and so to one us official security officials said that they were considering entrenching themselves in positions where they can serve as a check on trump either through direct advice to superiors or through the bureaucratic obstruction that features in every administration they would be able to rally allies in other agencies and on capitol hill some drew encouragement from the bipartisan opposition to trump over national security that featured in the campaign in the course of the dozens of national security and foreign policy officials from former republican administrations pledged in open letters or public statements that they would not serve under trump in 50 republican foreign policy and national security officials signed an open letter warning that trump be the most reckless president in one of who served in both bush said he did not believe the trump team would ultimately have difficulty filling administration posts in foreign policy and national think they will have any trouble at all i can personally identify a great deal of people who will be available some of whom i respect but he hope trump make some of the unfortunate choices that will be offered to counselor to secretary of state rice from

not care about human but there are people at who said john of human rights referring to the office of the secretary of defense pilots want to blow up rights watch and its allies are planning to press to take steps in the twilight of his presidency designed to constrain his successor they seek to urge to issue defining acts that constitute torture or sharply stipulating what secret programs require congressional notification while trump is free to repeal a executive the memo would create encumbrances or embarrassments for his legal staff should it emerge that he abrogated their however could add to what experts believe is a coming between traditionalist and camps on foreign is going to be a power struggle within the republican party between his camp and many of the mainstream foreign policy experts and officials they will try to make the case that he should have a more mainstream foreign and they may offer to come in to help run said the director of the project on international order and

former said that if us early warning radar showed the country was under attack by nuclear there would be time for a president to receive a briefing that could be as short as 30 seconds and the would

bully and i have confidence that he would be reasoned and restrained in a have argued that in the decision time is not that short the fact that the us has so many options and missiles as well as bombers means it does not have to launch on warning of an attack there would be more time for trump to think and ask for prompt launch of our nuclear missiles is not required nor is it us peter

her conversation with president elect at time this 2016 it is worth noting that of the three lessons that ed thinks progressives need to learn from trump two are ones that has already embraced policy agenda is not and he can credibly pose as an outsider but he is not particularly comfortable championing nationalism or patriotism ed the former was on the world at one talking about trump he expressed horror at politics like and this he accepted that trump won support because people were rightly fed up with the economic status said that he thought he had a of this problem when he was leader of the party but that his solutions were obviously sufficiently he lost the general since then appears to have given the subject more thought because in his interview he offered some fresh thinking on how political parties could respond to these challenges it was one of the most interesting interventions heard from any politician since election here are the key identified three lessons that progressive politicians could learn from the success of trump parties like needed to offer big stop defending the system like insiders and embrace he said i think there are deep lessons and what are the first of all the economic because whatever you say about trump and they offer big solutions i think they are false and we should not invent false gods of our own but our solutions are too incremental and not big enough for the diagnosis of inequality and the problems that we being political insiders is a massive problem trump was the outsider and i do think in a sense that got him permission to be heard and i think we have to think very hard about how we defend the broken politics that people but actually want to change this issue of nationhood and patriotism and the truth is that trump has invented a nasty view of but we yet have a convincing one of our own simply defending openness on its without has been proved to be deeply insufficient he said had failed we should certainly be saying has failed the current economic system does not work it has accrued the gains to the top and people have got squeezed and left said following the he accepted that there would have to be some controls on the free movement of citizens into the politicians had to understand he said having seen the referendum we have if at all to see some change in relation to free said that he still believed in and the advantages of the single but that this needed to be combined with fairness described trump as misogynistic and said people should be about his election the idea that we have shared values with a misogynistic groper beggars think we should be deeply worried about the implications for many of the things that we care tackling climate he says invented by the and a dealing with problems in the middle he says going to almost immediately the capital of with all kinds of implications that has for the middle east peace his attitude to and then this fantasy about trade this guy is anti an odd combination of protectionism plus the old tax cut formula that has got us into a lot of this mess in the first said election was symptomatic of a in ed will the has suggested that could damage global prosperity the first has said some of views are hopes for a continuation of the special relationship with the us under trump have suffered an early setback after the new spoke to

in my the and the have just created president an unqualified candidate who came up not through but through inheriting a gift for and being on won the popular trump won enough to get a majority of electoral votes that was a move to the right not unlike and the rule of prime minister in yet i also have to admit in answer to the question most often i hoped but never quite believed i would see a female president in my lifetime at not a woman like a first female president were someone or another woman who knew how to play the game and i have been surprised but just play the she changed the insisted that rights are human that women can decide the fate of our own that workers of all races should get paid the same as white men for the same that fathers can and should be equal that rights and rights should be fundamental to foreign and that global warming was a reality why she and always has supported more by women than by more by voters of color than by white and more by scientists than creationists also why she is deeply and vehemently resented twitter concession know there have always been women who could have changed the game i was in college when chase smith became the first us senator to oppose the trump of his day she also became the first woman whose name was placed in nomination for the presidency by a major party yet that was as far as she got in i ran as a delegate pledged to congresswoman a candidate for the presidency though she was only on the ballot in 14 she spoke out against the and against racism and sexism in education and politics in the public she took the male sign off the white house truth is that for two and a half this country has excluded females of every race from its top also the of males who are or otherwise seen as needing an also the who identify as gay or and also the who afford to purchase a college degree there has been only one president who and none who was openly atheist or agnostic add this and been selecting our top leadership from of our talent at most we may be giving birth to but there will be years of labor to come why electing was such a crucial beginning we were rewarded by his intellect and gift for his cool head and warm heart i believe he will be remembered as a great yet was often paralyzed by corporate and religious powers that are deeply and and include a male cult of guns sometimes i thought if his opponents had cancer and had the they accept in public opinion issues were rarely supported by more than a third of the their representatives were elected and by unlimited corporate gerrymandering by state and low voter turnout they took and kept control of the once centrist republican party that had produced chase smith and was the first to support the equal rights we need to be aware that this obstructionist minority is still hooked on hierarchy and still opposed to issues of equality add the fact that many especially powerful seen a female authority since and they felt and regressed by the prospect of in the most powerful position in the world add those white who are about to become a minority for the first and are opposed to everything from birth control it lowers the white birthrate to immigration it have racial and religious of this is guilt they fear being treated as they have treated others there is hostility to and real economic all of which trump or exposed the result a being not negative almost every issue of equality now has majority support in public opinion ideas of race and gender are activism and are exposing the racial violence that has always been sexual assault from the campus to the military is no longer and very public misogyny has unified educated men and inspired activism the hill but deepened and multiplied trump has helped to expose desperation among those jobless and working poor who support him only because they oppose is also telling that the angry third or so of this nation are desperate enough to support a soft by stereotypical man like trump he inherited his has no athletic or military record and no financial success earned on his has cheated the white male constituency he now behaves as a sexual predator toward women that alpha males are supposed to and sports cotton candy hair and suit jackets that fly open to reveal a gelatinous mass though a word is supposed to be his his own lawyer is a believer in the big lie theory if you say something again and people will believe to paraphrase the great his every word is a including and at times like used to truth is revealing because trump came up through mainstream corporate media that depend on ratings and not through a political media must take responsibility and refuse to give the next despot the estimated in free exposure that was given to trump centrist republicans must also take back their shattered party from extremists and even in this we have to recognize that electing one president and nominating one potential female president was only a beginning we all will have to learn that the president can only hold a finger to the wind we must become the truth has been revealed the next few years are going to be hell we know from family violence the paradigm of all violence that in that the most dangerous time is the moment just before or just after escape this is when a person is most likely to be beaten or killed because she or he is escaping think this country is in a time of danger because most of us are
always quick to get to the social media came up with an instant distillation of the global response to the unsettling election of trump as president of the united trump to meet at the white house live updates read declared that we had witnessed something more than a simple change of government a slogan would not have circulated had mitt beaten in it implied that trump had not merely taken over the running of the united states for four but that his presidency represented a much darker threat that it in destroy the twitter is prone to the hyperbolic and hysterical but more sober commentators were raising a similar albeit in not quite such stark terms the editor of the new spoke for many when he election of trump to the presidency is nothing less than a tragedy for the a tragedy for the and a sickening event in the history of the united states and liberal democracy it is impossible to react to this moment with anything less than revulsion and profound for the millions who shared that dawn on felt like mourning in they fear is that trump will make good on all the promises and threats he made during these last 18 months what if he goes ahead and deports 11 3 million undocumented what if he really does ban all entering the what if he tries to use the powers of the state to go after media that have him making life difficult for the businesses that own inquisitive newspapers such as the for example as he has said he what if he overturns abortion even imposing form of on a woman who terminates a as he once and what if he really does build that twitter how the 2016 us election night are plenty who believe that if trump went ahead and actually implemented his he would create a different xenophobic and at odds with some of the founding principles religious equality or freedom of speech that have defined the united states since its founding the country would still exist but it would no longer be there is a ready chorus of realists and quick to say that such talk is excessive those voices offer assorted forms of reassurance they make the perennial claim that every successful politician whatever the bluster and rhetoric of the campaign always moderates once in office this view holds it to be all but a law of nature that the radicalism of the candidate is always tempered by the reality of governing trump may have talked up a storm on his way to the white they but once behind the desk of the oval practical considerations will surely constrain runs the there are formal mechanisms in place to do just that the united after is ruled by a constitution that insists on the separation of so that the executive the president can never go too always held in check by both the independent in the form of the supreme and the congress these venerated institutions will surely prevent trump from doing anything too crazy less but also to be taken into account is the federal a vast civil service of who will ensure that any trump proposal is softened and smoothed into sanding off its more wild edges and there is always the they surely let trump get out of trouble none of those reassurances stacks up start with the notion that once he has sworn the oath of trump is bound to tone it dropping his most incendiary plans the trouble with that idea is that party bigwigs were saying the same thing throughout the earnestly hoping that trump would change once he became the that he would change once he won the party that he would change once he started the campaign proper in normal candidates do indeed do that but with it never happened twitter rams cheers as trump speaks at a rally in grand he kept sounding insulting bereaved military parents one a former miss universe the next the only time he agreed to take direction was in the very final when he finally stuck to a message and read scripted lines from a teleprompter but that was just for a few when the big shiny prize was in sight it is a slim foundation on which to build the hope that a man with a proven lack of impulse control just grab them by the will miraculously transform himself the minute he walks through the door of 1600 if the restraint come from what about from there be institutions to hold trump in the trouble republicans did not only win the they also won both houses of congress that gives trump enormous a strength that has eluded most of his predecessors w bush governed with a republican congress for a short spell before the last republican to enjoy such might was in result is that trump will face no congressional constraint they will do his bidding some have suggested while their party affiliation might be the trump will nevertheless encounter resistance on capitol hill because so many congressional republicans are hostile to him they cite the house who publicly clashed with trump several times on the campaign once accusing him of making a example of a racist and who endorsed trump only through gritted and trump mark a politicians must not pander to it read will not dare oppose trump now trump is the one with the national the winner of a much larger electoral college victory than anyone ever thought possible trump won states that had eluded the republicans for he even took which had been in democratic hands since 1988 that gives him huge clout inside the republican party he succeeded in doing what they had long failed to expanding the map and winning over white voters who had previously spurned so republicans in congress will be the junior partners in this new forced to bow to the man whose electoral appeal is

most pundits said they do most pollsters insisted they do everyone from the pope to said they do it now election victory changes both the game and the stakes he adopted a conciliatory both towards the

the electoral appeal of nationalist class racial animus and economic insecurity are by no means limited to most western nations have their and many of these trumps are having their day the campaigned

rural areas they were setting off was not inevitable there is no doubt that who has more experience that almost any candidate was qualified to do the job she may yet win the popular vote the problem was she did not have the qualities to win an election she maintained the coalition of the minorities and the university educated but could not them in sufficient numbers where it even as many emerged to vote not for trump but against her sexism played a given that trump won white women by a considerable there was more to it than that the certainly but that alone cannot explain historical symbolism of her candidacy stood for the status quo she in effect claimed she was running for third term but in a country where wages are class mobility has inequalities are growing and costs are people did not

the wealthy the white working class were a significant section of the trump coalition and swung in large numbers towards but they were not the dominant part of it the defining fault lines were also gender and town v trump have won without that shift in the white working and racism alone cannot explain that speaks up for the says who grew up in and voted for in 2008 and planned to vote for trump this year is systemic but black people have advocates poor white people the whole idea white pisses poor white people off because never experienced it on a level that they understand you hear

in an unexpected trump rode the wave of sentiment to become the next of the us if a living in or the like to hear from what do you make of the how are you share your reactions with us by filling in the form below feature a selection of responses in our live elections politics
trump has been elected the 45th president of the united states this comes after a controversial campaign that included contentious remarks about trump said he would ban them from entering the us if elected he later downgraded this threat by saying he would impose on anyone coming from a land he considers suspect so how do in the us feel now been voted into from am worried that negative sentiment will grow because of in the community are really shocked i was at a party with friends earlier and when i left we were in high trump was but not by much i never expected this to happen i thought the people let trump be president this is a lot of worst nightmare come are lots of different emotions among today students are crying because they are worried about their or they are worried about wearing the headscarf in public some people are joking not about leaving the country people like me think this is a chance to continue the work been being politically to make sure such a nasty election happen again we will fight so people cannot make statements about banning hate crimes and attacks against doubled in last year report read a call it shows half of the country either agrees with what trump has or that they have just chosen to ignore it and vote for him because of their dislike of has mentioned some scary such as surveying but i am more worried about the backlash from his supporters there has been a growing number of attacks and against in these attacks are not carried out by trump but his rhetoric encourages them i am more worried about the negative sentiment that might grow because of trump than what he will actually do i know he is very and that in itself is scary from his campaign people have been more negative about was working in the polling station because i wanted to do my duty to the community and my country i wanted to represent not just but all minorities so that when people walked into the polling station they would feel empowered i was in shock when i trump had won there are arguments about whether he can or cannot make things worse for black and and for women in the us many would argue that we have checks in so no one can disrupt our but i worry his presence in the white house will empower every racist person on my street who might discriminate against me i cover my hair and wear a and i stand out when i walk down the street everyone has always been very welcoming to and i experienced but right now i can feel that world shattering in front of my eyes i took an oath to respect the laws of but now the state has elected someone who speak respectfully about me as a woman or as an i have noticed a change in tone since his campaign started and people are more vocal about being unwelcome people have been unashamed to make derogatory statements about every group because they feel strengthened by him people will now if he can say these things and win the presidency of the why others speak like from are disappointed but pointless to just feeling of disbelief has settled over the world even though it was clear as the night went on that the result was heading this it still came as a blow while i acknowledge that trump has won the presidential race it make it any easier to accept i cast my vote for senator sanders in the but voted for this week in the presidential am concerned about what this means for the discourse around women in the united states has repeatedly altered her image over the past three decades in order to appeal to the public and yet it worked what does our failure to elect arguably the most qualified woman in the country for the job say about like the majority of who did not vote for are disappointed with the but we feel it is pointless to despair this is just the especially for those who remain dedicated to the regardless of who the electorate chose optimism and diplomacy are difficult at the but we will need those qualities over the next four it is ridiculous to say that in the united states should not be concerned about our future in this country trump has made statements about banning and they should not be taken especially if he is backed by congress in the years to from new will protect us minorities am going through so many different emotions right now i am by what has happened i asked my mother this morning whether we were in some sort of nightmare i seen such hatefulness and such a negative climate towards since the aftermath of just very hard to stomach that a man who has been using hateful rhetoric over and over will be the leader of the free world i thought the election was going well i was up watching it until i knew was behind but thought she would pull it back somehow waking up this morning and finding out trump had i was floored i imagine that he would be and that the republicans had won so many seats in congress who will protect us minorities i know a lot of politicians have always said there are certain lines they cross but it feels like trump has no crossed them all he has been accepted by the general population despite which is scary what does the us election result say about and others read has been elevated to a high platform i always used to joke that i would move to if he were but i never thought trump would win i have lived in this country for 26 i came here at six months old as an afghan refugee
the long i have a lifelong republican who voted for am very disappointed about the but i be despondent i am by nature an optimistic person as the evening wore on and it became clear that trump was going to i started thinking about what is actually going to happen after this in the there will be dark and things will happen that are not good for our or for the world sure that the affordable care act for i believe that the republicans will start to realize that they really get what they wanted after a republican he has made that clear he just agrees with them on some or claims to i think the first half of term will go very badly for the voters will become and the midterm elections in 2018 will be disastrous for them democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of congress get a new supreme court but not worried about whether be too conservative i would be more worried that they be qualified in the long i have believe in checks and voted for voted shortly after polls open on and i voted for trump no disrespect intended to the third party but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either trump or so i was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook i chose to vote for the incompetent in the end it the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that and would modify the impending chaos the system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter trump than trump has already lost substantial support among the so he count on either the existing supreme court or congress to ignore there is the press what we see is a press overwhelmingly a vote for means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of potential malfeasance nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter in any meaningful way so i voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without establishment underestimated the voted for i think all astounded instead of predictable fifth facing nobody quite knows what i never thought this was a serious possibility until but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the since the primary was rigged against the only major this was the next prominent way to give the democrats a heave else refreshing to see their awfulness finally backfire on not exactly shocked at but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the duopoly or help the greens reach federal funding levels the impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the status quo more than an actual endorsement of racism or but the forces unleashing are volatile and damn scary as the bigger struggle starts after voting positive change only comes from public so arguably a better chance for it now than under a democratic president if no actual policy coming from the oval space for saner voices to shape it be but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back the campaign got younger voters surprisingly engaged and proved that candidates have to be owned by corporate money if enough remember the power lies with we may have a fighting chance after am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the voted for lost this election because sexism enabled voters to perceive the most qualified candidate in the world as someone more reprehensible bar the most despicable person who has ever sought the presidency because the contingent of mostly white overlooked empathy for minority groups due to their own positions of privilege because of voter because we watched happen and refused to heed its am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the world ashamed of my state in particular and dread what consequences it will bring the fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done it should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe i know the cold fear you are experiencing the only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed if you find this rhetoric if you are then seize any opportunity to defy it do not wait to speak out until they come for you to your loss is the loss i am sorry they were too blind to see waking up to today scares voted for my wildest dreams i never would have thought the public would swing so wildly away from reason as to elect someone like trump i grew up in a family a liberal but my father was conservative been a single mom working multiple jobs to keep a roof over my head and struggled to make ends meet as long as i can remember i understand the feeling that represent the but the waking up to today scares me and left with only kind of world will my grandson grow up what will happen to friends and people of color who unlike born here someone once called it my how could it be a good idea to elect a man who treats women so makes promises he has no interest in learning the nuances of and brags about not paying why does the public react so negatively to a woman taking a role of where is the critical decency and respect have gone out the door in this election and just sold our collective soul to the country split in
contribute trump has been short on policy details during his campaign but the has hinted at an agenda that is as ambitious as it is disturbing on key policy issues what he will inherit and how he might from the trump will enter the white house riding a wave of xenophobia and fear driven in no small part by his plans to drastically overhaul immigration system the has pledged to implement many tenets of his controversial reform package from day one and will now be emboldened by a republican majority in both houses of congress countless immigrant communities across will no doubt be terrified about just how far he might go trump wins us poised to give concession speech live read promise to build an physical across the us southern border will supposedly commence on his first day in office but the kicker to his now infamous campaign slogan making pay for will prove a near impossible deal to broker as experts predict the cost of such a construction could be four times higher than trump estimated during the campaign aside from the the humanitarian consequences of increasing border security as hundreds of thousands of central migrants continue to flee violence at home and seek refuge in the us are near unfathomable administration has pledged to pursue a temporary ban on migration from regions he deems exporters of terrorism and where even his will not be sufficient although this policy has gone through many the legality of such a program will almost certainly be challenged in the courts by those who argue it will simply act as a smokescreen to allow discrimination against seeking to enter trump is likely to be buoyed by the assistance of congress for the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the presidency will usher in an era of heightened uncertainty and as the has pledged to ramp up deportations trump will triple the number of immigration and customs enforcement agents and seek to create a deportation although the has claimed this will first focus on most dangerous criminal illegal trump has made clear that any undocumented migrants could be affected up to 6 5 million people could be at risk of swift deportation the key question for the new administration will be at what if can it satisfy the demands of its conservative whipped up by the rhetoric of the campaign oliver twitter what will be the first actions trump takes as now has control over the vast us security with all its power to and influence whose command of policy specifics is has made no secret of his inclination to unleash it now he faces early tests of how far he will will leave office with bay still in operation as a detention facility election ensures the infamous wartime prison escapes but it will probably cross a constitutional the has pledged to increase the a reversal of some bad among those trump told the could be citizens his pledge to bring back than threatens to undo the shaky coalition against especially in a of the late bush and administrations the move would be illegal if trump meant to try in military and almost sure to be found unconstitutional if trump meant holding in indefinite detention in the same trump also signaled a departure from both and w bush in expressing opposition to using the criminal justice system for terrorism definition of the domestic threat has centered on what he has called us already the target of widespread suspicion since would probably find themselves subject to a separate system of wartime justice in which they would enjoy fewer has unapologetically embraced as a approach to predicting terrorist by which he means increasing police and intelligence scrutiny of communities trump has endorsed surveillance in mosques and even a database of incendiary proposals that threaten traditional liberties the response of the leadership which already has a strong base of support for trump and a history of teaching its agents to consider itself a danger will be a pivotal test for justice in the trump era so will his choice of intelligence agency as trump has attracted little support among experienced intelligence officials outside of the fringe another immediate test trump faces will be a military challenge will leave 8 , 400 us troops in the fortunes of longest war are on a downward trajectory as the reconquers lost terrain who has criticized a withdrawal in he once supported as a gift to must now choose failure or twitter president on in spent the campaign threatening to upend what has been called the liberal international the network of treaties and multilateral institutions that govern global relations he has said he would tear up and renegotiate trade and has even called into question us commitment to the the linchpin of western cohesion with a completely new kind of leader preparing to enter the oval it is already looking like a world turned upside multilateral trade deals the partnership and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership with will be the first to be halted opposition to those accords was a cornerstone of the trump campaign trump has also said he would take apart the 1994 north free trade agreement that binds the us economically it to its and place of such he has said he would negotiate bilateral deals that would be more favorable for us manufacturing but he would face hostile trading irritated at the dumping of major agreements could easily face a trade backlash and a downward economic other consistent theme of the trump campaign was a foreign policy that revolved around his personality he would bring his skills as a businessman to cut bilateral deals with other world particularly the autocrats trump said he would even talk to if the north dictator would travel to the us for the conversation that is but the prospect of an unconditional between leaders would throw a wild card into a deadlocked and extremely dangerous situation in which is well on
despite a lack of political business magnate trump swept to an improbable victory in the us presidential is clear that despite a series of his message resonated with a huge number of voters in key and revealed deep anger and trump wins us to deliver concession speech live read spoke to six trump voters about why they voted for the republican and why they think make a good want the legacy continued in the white is a man regardless of getting a hefty loan from his he used that money to make a name and legacy for himself i hope that experience as a businessman will enable our country to operate more effectively when it comes to managing our money i want to change to serve the people instead of a political system that wants to serve itself my life change except i will have more hope that my government is trying to make our country strong instead of pandering to its own liberal interests my main hope is that he will help balance our and secondly that he will help our economy to remain want the legacy continued in the white house we impeached one and there is too much scandal that revolves around the other why would i want that legacy in my he may say controversial but at least he tells you what he thinks i certainly disagree with anyone that has behaved in a racist or sexist way i feel like i know where i stand with trump he says what he right or and i know what dealing so tired of the media and democrats bellyaching about trump getting voted in what the people pretty sad when all you hear is gloom and doom on the which i thought was supposed to be a balanced representation of the two sides there is a whole other part to this country outside of your newsroom walls that actually thinks differently from the mostly liberal ideas that most news outlets put out there we are middle we are the hardworking people who are holding this country together with our and we are ready to have a country that keeps its book in balance like we do with our private bank accounts small business owner knows how to make deals that will make prosperous was a democrat for 39 but my children and grandchildren need an that is out of debt all that did was double the debt since he took office i will feel a whole lot safer than i ever would with the biggest question is to ask why he kept sending troops and flooding us with refugees that are not vetted for the proper amount of time with the possibility of terrorists mixing in and coming to our my great nephew is still asking that question as he did two tours in he got out because he felt the president care about him or his comrades we have the greatest veterans in the i am one of them the last two presidents care about what happened to us created but minimum wage jobs you support a family on a minimum wage our manufacturing plants are the coal industry is gone from my area and would just shut it down the rest of the way is a failure thank god i have to use it but there are families that need it and if they afford it they get fined that in itself is the mindset of a dictator was going to expand it and make it available for illegals believe trump will be a good president because he knows how to make deals that will make prosperous again we need to bring our nation together i like the fact that all three branches are controlled by the same now we can get down to the business of straightening out our taking care of our our getting the economy moving again and repealing retired from the federal government twitter how the 2016 us election night want conservative cried when i left the polling location because i like trump at all i was deeply saddened to vote for him his his mannerisms and his inexperience repulse me i wish there had been another conservative choice without simply throwing away my vote i know if i travel outside of the us i will be deeply disliked because of him he is only a investment and i am trusting in the checks and balances of our country to prevent him and his from damaging the country too much hopefully trump will not affect my daily personally do not have a gun but i strongly support the right to bear arms it as a right that ensures protection from government tyranny i am also against has the opportunity to elect a supreme court maybe even two or three members considering the current health and age of some justices justices serve for a lifetime and i do not want the justices to be liberal i want conservative laws therefore conservative justices i can deal with a somewhat low four but i deal with a supreme court that swings liberal and i deal with losing gun rights i hope the years fly by and that he will do as little damage as possible i am deeply saddened by these options and i am not proud of our president in the least is exactly what you with you know decide who to vote for until the day before voting it was one the hardest decisions i have ever made i decided on trump for one zones guaranteed full scale war with on day one i mean how do you expect to initiate a zone over a sovereign that would then in turn guarantee a conflict with which will assuredly lead to know would have been business as usual as we ever closer to a nuclear war with four years is a long time but there is always and the next election a risk but
may has congratulated trump on his us presidential election as the and his lib expressed deep unease at the sturgeon has urged trump to prove that he can act for all us citizens regardless of their heritage after his surprise victory in the us presidential has pledged to share the on with the leaderships of northern and before the first meeting of a forum intended to allow the devolved administrations to help shape families who claimed that the bedroom which restricts housing was unfair have won their appeals against the government at the supreme international has a trade minister for to to seek contracts for companies ahead of the 2022 world cup without apparently highlighting the human rights abuses faced by migrant workers building venues for the all from me for for the comments what will or should presidency mean for the here are three good articles that address at the economist says a trump presidency will make harder a single theme unifies these risks is a giant shock to place in the world it will sever old links and require new ones to be forged as some of its keenest proponents this transition will bring painful costs most of all it demands lots of good will and flexibility on all sides in so far as win means a more more volatile global it raises those costs and shrinks that space for compromise and consensus essential for a smooth the damage of a trump presidency on a demands ambition and perspective from may her approach should be build a closer alliance with not just on but on wider the world and china in and other capitals officials complain that referendum result has taken mind off all other matters the prime minister must not allow that to happen and instead work with as a bloc capable of countering worst may should use influence in is if not as much as like to to attempt to moderate the new staying his hand when he does wrong and indulging his vanity when he does right may already had her hands full with for sake and that of the she must also deal with executive director of stronger in at the new statesman looks at what the left can learn from the trump and victories a new politics is one with the seeds of dignity we must find our way to a prosperity which gives people a greater sense of where communities have more autonomy to judge their own and where international cooperation is used to tackle the worst excesses of including tax human trafficking and illegal do we need a new language of politics one that refuses to pander to prejudice but that what the social psychologist calls the which those on the left cannot hear for imagine that there are concentric circles of loyalty country which are not just a comfort blanket in times of but are hardwired into us as human this overt displays of patriotism which may make liberals uncomfortable can in fact be and used to reinforce positive values an academic and former adviser to has called it which from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to the welfare of not to pursue some abstract concept of the global at asks if the special relationship can survive we cannot know in advance how protectionist the us is going to become but we can know that as a trading nation wanting to buy and sell freely with the whole is likely to be a loser if protectionism really does become the of the least the traditionally close relationship between our intelligence services and those of can still be depended upon but it is not going to be a comfortable or predictable may and had better mean it when they say that will have a great new partnership with our friends and going to need it tom a researcher at the foreign policy has posted an interesting thread on twitter about the implications of win for foreign implicitly defends decision not to express any reservations about trump today see point twin poles of foreign policy for 40 years have been special w us and active membership of both in if foreign policy has a strategic purpose it is building rules based order trump diametrically in post war history has never had to manage a us which is actively undermining its main international this is more significant than past splits over the two governments will no longer share a world uncomfortable but must stay close to trump for influence concerns of close ally may provide cover to alter course on for gov to publicly trump should be resisted better to be ally he listens to than join critics geopolitical context for completely changed will still happen but imperative to do so in way that does n't further fracture trump will also be less useful as an ally than in negotiating brings could have pressured to give avoid splits in west not clear trump even more essential now that and find a new mo for cooperation on foreign policy as leaves if us cannot lead and must try to fill the vacuum unity this will create pressure for gov to raise and pressure to do same tricky for given fiscal ambitions for to be serious global player have generally rung hollow if this change what trump exceptionally bad news for managing climate goal and one of few multilateral success stories of recent if pen wins in then the may unravel and all bets are 2016 the outgoing is spending the day at a in with among others a spokesman said would not be speaking to the press in and was due to fly to later in the day but has issued this statement the establishment is in deep shock even more so than after what we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives voters across the western world want nation
after a long and bitter campaign for the us trump has triumphed over and the financial markets have been rocked for supporters he represents a chance to shake up a system that many feel has increased inequality and squeezed living standards for less complacent there are worries mantra will spread protectionism around the put up trade barriers and curb global economic growth markets do not like unknowns and with trump going to the white house they are dealing with a complete newcomer to politics his administration is widely expected to mark a departure from the policies of his own republican party as well as the outgoing what do we know about economic we look at the key into economic discontent trump has argued for protectionism and asserted that decades of policies were responsible for the collapse of the manufacturing industry he has been feeding on the perception among many that has brought more pain than for by bringing cheap consumer goods into the costing domestic jobs and depressing wages outsourcing of jobs to cheaper markets has also been a concern against that stance on trade is perhaps the clearest of his economic policies the billionaire republican wants to or possibly even the north free trade agreement lowers trade barriers between the and and was negotiated by bush and enacted in the by bill the incoming president wants to offer a better deal for and has rejected claims by his opponents that the deal has helped the us economy by opening up export protectionism with regard to does not stop there one of most notorious pledges in the presidential campaign was to build a wall along the us southern border and force to pay for it on the markets on fears over the blow to economy from victory have sent the peso plummeting other global trade deals are also now very much in notably the trans pacific partnership between 12 countries around the pacific excluding and the agreement being negotiated between the us and known as the transatlantic trade and investment partnership in terms of trade both and the now look dead in the an economist at the bank we are minded to disregard some of wilder we consider that there is a tangible risk that a trump presidency could fuel momentum and spark a wave of protectionist policies around the globe in terms of trade both and the now look dead in the has also made his anger with china over trade well arguing that since china joined the world trade have witnessed the closure of more than 50 , 000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs he wants the us government to label china a and has lambasted the rapidly growing economy for subsidy here trump has played into frustrations among many over their sense of financial inequality and squeezed incomes who has faced fierce criticism for appearing to escape paying income tax himself for almost two promised tax cuts for all income has pledged massive tax for working and and has vowed to eliminate income taxes for individuals who earn less than or for a married couple he has also said he would the rich pay their fair but analysis by the conservative tax foundation has found tax plan would disproportionately help the richest saving them has also supported lower corporate proposing to cut the business tax rate from to he wants to close special interest tax loopholes and to restrict companies from moving money out of the country he has also proposed a corporate tax repatriation plan to encourage us companies which hoard cash overseas to avoid paying the tax to bring that cash back to the us according to capital economics this cash hoard is now a tax holiday so the tax due would be only for a period could encourage corporations to bring back cash to invest or distribute to those tax cuts mean less coming in to government at least in the there is an argument that the potential boost to businesses and to household spending power would lift the economy enough to improve government finances for economists expect that plans for tax cuts across the board will mean the us taking on more debt as its deficit the gap between spending and income the chief us economist at the bank the budget while cutting tax rates at the same will be difficult without sizable cutbacks in federal spending if a trump administration manages to push through tax cuts with matching spending federal budget which are already trending will probably increase in our twitter trump called an expensive wants to repeal and replace president introduced under the affordable care act with his cheaper plan for health savings accounts on the campaign trump called an expensive 20 million more people have insurance thanks to the but the scheme has struggled to run efficiently because it relies on competition between insurers to provide affordable and that competition has dwindled most trump plan on immigration is for a wall along the border he also said he would deport 11 million undocumented something opponents say is physically impossible he wants immigrants to be selected on the basis of likelihood of success in the us and their ability to be financially and in the us has dropped below a good record on the surface for but during his trump has focused on those parts of the economy and country where the recovery since the financial crash has not being gaining traction with those who have seen their industries diminish and their wages the campaign trump chose the once booming industrial of to set out his economic plan he cited the motor unemployment rate and crime levels in a speech that played on widespread worries about the decline of us has said his protectionist policies will keep and wealth inside the united he has promised to increase saying his plans for lower trade barriers and tighter immigration rules would lead to stronger economic growth as with
the unthinkable is only unthinkable until it happens like the sack of it can seem historically inevitable so it is with the global political earthquake that is the election of trump as the next president of the united states if he is true to his campaign which were many and win will herald most stunning reversal of political and economic orthodoxy since the new deal in the but with the opposite intention and effect it halts the ailing progressive narrative about modern and the world in its tracks it signals a seismic rupture in the global liberal economic and political order that had seemed to command the 21st century after communism collapsed and economy that the trump triumph has echoes of the increasingly alarming general rightward shift in the politics of other western to which progressives have again produced inadequate responses the parallel with vote is obvious and real is the further boost that the trump triumph may hand to nationalists in many parts of marine pen jumped quickly on that bandwagon the result will be lamented by liberals across and beyond but it will be cheered in and which will feel emboldened this is not a good week to be a or a and another dire one to be a the result is also a generational challenge to progressive politics to find the radical and credible message that eludes them in so many not just in taken this is primarily an catastrophe that has brought upon itself when it came to the us was unable to find a credible way of rallying against trump and what he represents failed that crucial test both in herself and in what she for her this is the end but she was the not the cause trump was not taken seriously and was widely not expected to beat throughout the bitter campaign at each his candidacy was deemed certain to crash and burn the opinion polls and the vaunted probability calculus rarely trended in his both are now discredited only after the less than two weeks before the was it widely imagined that the tables might turn in nevertheless by the eve of poll trump was again the trump won big in an election if the exit polls were most people made up their minds long before the furore victory was total it was more than anything on the white irrespective of age or white people mostly voted for him it was the most stunning upset in modern us not even a squeaker he won most of the battleground states into which the campaign had poured money north and en route to a decisive republican electoral college total exceeding 300 that majority is on the flyover which inhabitants of the big democratic bastions on the coasts often only see from 35 , 000 feet but the red tide pushed north deep into the and consolidated in the south although the electoral college system amplified is set to win the popular as democrats have in every election bar one since republican congressional candidates who had scrabbled to put distance between themselves and their nominee after the ugly debates found themselves riding to victory on coattails republicans held most of their seats in the senate and will be the chance to extend their majority in when the beneficiaries of the wave of 2012 face the voters more the house remained firmly in republican hands speaker and his lieutenants have more to fear from their own party grassroots and from a perhaps vengeful new man in the white house than they do from the shattered for whom this outcome is the sum of all trump is the shock heard round the world now that he has the instant explanations have already started to flood that the of this or that demographic was that he tapped the angry that he spoke for millions who felt abandoned by the prosperous and that was always far stronger than liberals wanted to that he was a celebrity candidate for the that he rode the tiger of that making great again was a message in a militaristic and imperial that white men many white had had it with political that misogyny swung that the mainstream media failed to call him that it is a verdict on the that was always the wrong that there was racist dirty work in the voting that it was the who won it for him twitter highlights from presidential victory of these explanations are irrelevant all of them have something to say but beware of instant certainties as with in the immediate aftermath of a huge a period of careful and reflection is in order this is not to diminish the immense seriousness of what happened on nor is it to understate the anxieties about what lies ahead as steps back and trump takes particular fears now stand out the first is the unleashing of an unbridled conservative agenda in now that the republicans control the white house and capitol hill a rare thing in the past hundred years in her dignified concession speech rightly the need to defend democratic she might have drawn attention to president legacy on and climate change too trump and the congressional republicans have he is more prepared to use the power of government than many of them are but they have a clear path now towards reshaping the supreme court and dozens of judicial benches in their own image the effect on gender and issues is likely to outlast period in office the culture wars will reopen abortion rights are second is the impact of this result on race in more widely trump campaigned against migrants and against insulted black and launched ads that some saw as covertly and was cheered to victory by every white racist in the land his voters a echo again will want him to deliver every action he takes in this area threatens to divide and inflame after a of uneven but undeniable racial progress

no 10 policy its heart this is about a broken contract through the failure of market economics to serve the interests of domestic said the result was stunning demonstration of how low income feel by politics and insurgency is a big test for the constitutional protections for liberty and democracy in the and the us it is clear we are living through a genuine crisis of legitimacy sweeping through western political asked whether the leaders will wake up to roar of anger at machine and out of touch who was a fierce critic of the tone of campaign and at one point described him as key now is how he and who he appoints to his sturgeon urged trump to prove that he can act for all us citizens regardless of their heritage the first minister said many us voters and others around the world would feel real sense of at his hope the will take the opportunity to reach out to those who felt by his campaign and make clear in deeds as well as words that he will be a president for everyone in multicultural must also be a moment for those who share progressive values all of us who believe in tolerance and diversity to speak up loudly and clearly for the values we hold president said win up a period of that be faced with lucidity and congratulated trump is natural between two heads of but showed little enthusiasm had openly endorsed positions taken by trump during the campaign must be confronted with the values and interests we share with the united he said is at stake is the fight against the situation in the middle east it is economic relations and the preservation of the minister said politicians should heed the message from trump votes is a part of our electorate that feels including people who feel behind by he no country outside the union we have as close a relationship with as the united states of whoever rules this vast with its enormous economic its military its cultural carries a responsibility which is felt all over the world have decided that the person to carry this responsibility for the next four years is trump and are connected by common respect for the law and for human dignity irrespective of skin sexual orientation or political conviction on the basis of these i offer the future president of a close working relationship partnership with the remains a basic pillar of foreign policy in order for us to meet the great challenges of our striving for economic and social wellbeing and a climate the fight against hunger and engagement for peace and in and all over the foreign i believe the biggest challenge will be to meet the high expectations that trump himself has to make great also with a view to the to create new jobs in the current economic all that be easy above all i hope that we facing bigger tectonic shifts in international politics during his campaign trump has spoken critically not just about but particularly about i think we have to prepare for the fact that foreign policy will be less predictable for us in the future we have to be prepared for the fact that will be more inclined to make unilateral decisions in the said the results were a she told broadcaster think trump knows that this was not a vote for him but rather against against the prime who was a vocal supporter of even before she secured the democratic offered his congratulations to trump the name of and said he was convinced that the

that what he was saying was correct they saw it in the realities of their life human values have been annihilated and trampled upon in that country there is racial discrimination in that a political

first dog on the moon on president trump a elections
we asked a panel of experts how a trump presidency could affect on everything from climate change policy to trade and regional place in institute executive big picture move would be that trump is in of retreating from the retreating from the us steps back from it becomes a much harder environment for to operate and to have a order all we know is he has certain that allergic to sympathetic to strong men like his views have echoes of trump wins presidential plunging us into uncertain future read minister and ambassador to he were to pursue his objectives internationally it will effectively suspend leadership in global free trade and in the global at face policies could induce crises in the military relationship with two of most important trading partners and japan he will discombobulate the pivot to that has a focus that was and twitter highlights from presidential victory alliance and relationship with trump presidency would be a sobering result for many according to institute polling over trump by trump half of wanted us to distance the country from the us if someone like trump were think it would affect the the alliance has existed for 70 years and goes beyond personality of those at the but a president trump would stretch strategic policy institute executive going to have to do a lot more hard thinking than we have in recent years about how to sustain the effectiveness of the alliance got a selling job to persuade him paying our dues in terms of spending and militarily in the middle the us the instinct of politicians was to soothe that says a lot read is an enormous we are deeply embedded in the military intelligence side of the relationship the capacity to defend ourselves is attached to particularly the military equipment we buy from the told sky news does have one advantage under a trump are a member of the only alliance that the trump people unreservedly approve of so at least got a basis of a discussion with at united states studies what heard in speeches so has been conspicuously missing from all his discussions of allies that are asymmetrically benefiting from its us ambassador to the hockey has said he is reassured by people near trump that is in the good and i think in terms of that likely to see much market loses as key states go trump 's way read has said some very concerning things about lifting tariffs on trump imposes the tariff talking about with respect to it will cause close to an economic crisis no wonder the stock market has fallen trump looks likely to win the electoral john director security and political engagement in the school of is very of free not automatically a bad but he may be much less open to trade with other and that could well be challenging to exporting you go down the path of trade it has huge implications for the foreign exchange and the stability of the suggested it might be harder to export to the us and cause an increase in consumer prices for imports if there is retaliation from security much is unknown but trump has said the and south should do considerably more for their own and not concerned about whether that includes gaining nuclear weapons think a lot of that is campaign talk we have to see how he will proceed in office but he is probably one of the least experienced presidents in decades when it comes to foreign policy any perceived reduction of us interest in the region could lead to strategic situations including rapid nuclear arms great delight in likely trump presidency read respect to the south china said it clear whether the us under trump would push back more or less against afford to be sitting on the secure in the knowledge the us will undertake freedom of navigation exercises going to have to be much more engaged repeatedly pretty hard to imagine a man who be trusted with twitter in charge of the biggest store of nuclear weapons in the world begin the task of being president with the capacity to be a peaceable leader of the most powerful country in the world in ways that would contribute to prosperity or us has been in the region since it has been insurer of stability by providing troops and guaranteeing it would step in should some key allies be these sort of guarantees are withdrawn the logic of security dilemma comes into play one country starts it decreases the security of others and makes them more compelled to arm themselves a very perilous spiral which obviously subtracts from security in the institute chief no doubt this will be an extremely serious but not agreement is structured in such a now it is in force and with us so that trump technically remove the us from the agreement so it actually devastate the structure of the checks and balances in the which may allow any country to go off on a bit of a has capacity to bring them back into the fold my most optimistic take on is a climate change will have to be a stronger advocate for responsible environmental policies of course be a large body of opinion supporting that in the many states will have responsible climate but you expect the us administration to lead on this been mentioned once in presidential debates that sends a signal about its priority or lack of in both campaigns if trump does what he announced to china a climate agreement enabled by cooperation with china will basically also fall down the drain we would not be likely to see movement on this should will be an expectation that we use the fact that we are the only alliance that the us unreservedly approves of to mitigate the worst effects of the directions trump is prepared to head a smaller ally we have to sell the alliance

it is one of the most astonishing victories in political history it will leave millions in the us and beyond in wondering what is to and how did trump do was the first reality star and the first since to win the nomination for president of a major political party he was the first to spend part of his campaign denying sexual assault allegations and clashing with the family of a fallen soldier and a miss universe at he is the oldest person in history to be elected us simple copied and recast promise to make great again in four words it captured both pessimism and both fear and hope the slogan harks back to a supposed golden age of greatness the or the and implies that it has been lost but then promises to restore it it went straight to the unlike rival website manifesto and more nuanced was an appeal to the not the in a country where patriotism should never be a host on said in lot of this support for with all his flaws which he displays is about the country patriotic feelings people they feel like the country has been let down our elite leaders on issues like they regulate any immigration it seems they regulate trade to our to the working man or working advantage they take us into stupid wars their kids fight but our kids trump wins presidential plunging us into uncertain future read patriotic they believe in their country is deep sense that the country is being taken away and betrayed i think that is so deep with people that looking at a guy flawed as hell like trump and at least a way of saying i am really angry about the way the elite has treated my country and so deep that it overwhelms all the bad stuff from trump that strong a strong force 2003 trump became the host of the reality show the in which hopefuls competed for a chance to work for his for a decade millions of viewers were fed the idea of trump as a successful a boss with the power to biographer gave him 10 years of being in front of the public being the being hiring famously firing being the guy who can fix the one who knows being the big authoritarian patriarchal lost the the trust and a weak message read think that has imprinted on a lot of that they that that makes him that combined with the reality phenomenon in which it became acceptable to have something that really true it a kind of a thing and shifted our idea of an acceptable version of the media trump had accumulated not only financial capital but celebrity capital on 8 he cashed in twitter victory speech in full he faced a candidate whose unpopularity rating was surpassed only by his own as the wife of a former president running to succeed a she was the ultimate face of the establishment in a year that was all about change the lack of enthusiasm compared to rise in 2008 was unique vulnerability was exposed when she struggled to beat senator a socialist from in the democratic primary main theme was a rigged economy in regions of and wage trump rode the same and who perceived themselves to be caught in an economic downdraft their children would be worse off than they were wanted a simple fix and trump seemed to provide it as witnessed by the rise of other populists around the there were global forces at work that not even and the democrats could long political career also came with most notably the investigation into her use of private email server when she was secretary of state she was judged to have been and the issue flared up again in late when the said it uncovered a new batch of emails the whiff of scandal persisted despite his decision to clear her again just over a week later historians are likely to debate how crucial director intervention was in tilting the race when set against her own failings as a politician twitter bizarre road to the campaign in three republican seemingly declared war on his own party during and after a traumatic primary he attacked the bush house speaker former nominees mitt and john and many more it was anything but a united front and it would normally have cost him in terms of a lack of or financial many trump voters relished his attacks on the party establishment they complained the the members of congress they elected made promises they fail to keep they noticed the years of deadlock and government shutdown and thirsted for change so when and company condemned it actually worked to his advantage as a rallying point for his supporters he ripped up the rule book as the maverick outsider set to march on at the the republican national committee never lost faith in him chair was quick to declare trump the nominee and twist and turn and excuse his every chief strategist and communications director aggressively pushed the trump cause even as pieces of debris flew off in every the party machinery kept working to deliver the of and vindication for property demagogue and now president read the demographics were against him when was first elected in of the total voter turnout was white by this had fallen to and in it

held the white house for eight years would have been the first candidate since bush in 1988 to extend one hold for a third term even high approval rating evidently did not dim the appetite for his direct mastermind of election wrote in the new times last presidential elections are shaped by perceptions of the style and personality
a month ago i tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to pull it off there is a darkness about trump that negates that sort of a folly so an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever in saying so i am not referring to his business practices or his vulgar remarks about women i mean this in a purely technical this man fractured his own party his convention was a fiasco he had no ground game to speak of the list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short he needlessly offended countless groups of disabled mothers of crying the bush and among others he even lost for now he is going to be president of the united states the woman we were constantly assured was the candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time everyone who was anyone rallied around and it make any difference the man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the oval whence he will hand down his verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old there is a bright side to a trump victory after there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him he has pledged to the of and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task he has promised to renegotiate and maybe will finally come to pass maybe win so much for us he once predicted in a campaign that get sick of not deceive ourselves we going to win anything what happened on is a both for liberalism and for the world as president trump goes about settling scores with his former picking fights with other and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne what we need to focus on now is the obvious what the hell went what species of guided our democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our at the top she has an impressive she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine twitter victory speech in was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a victory would have moved every democrat in up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary something that was taken for granted had winning been the number one several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was with his powerful plainspoken and there was an inspiring and largely figure each of them would probably have beaten but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party so democratic leaders made their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the her fondness for and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose even though they knew about her private email server they chose her even though some of those who studied the foundation suspected it was a sketchy try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a monster is to court disbelief if trump is a as liberals often democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop not a party hack chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats mean what they said about that their opportunism took precedence over the or maybe supporters among the media help either it always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the but it was the quality of the enthusiasm that really harmed her with the same arguments repeated over and two or three times a with nuance and contrary views all the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a cold war propaganda station what it consisted was virtually without flaws she was a peerless leader clad in saintly a a caring benefactor of women and a warrior for social scandals real the economy was doing well was already people supporting if they it was only because they were botched humans racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the republican candidate how did the crusade the fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus they chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them they transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting what could possibly have gone wrong with such an put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery of 2016 the class just spent the year rallying around a professional really all that and either insulting or silencing everyone who accept their assessment and then they lost maybe time to consider whether something about shrill shouted from a position of high social that turns people even larger problem is that there is a kind of chronic complacency that has been rotting liberalism for a hubris that tells democrats they need do nothing they need deliver nothing really to anyone except their friends on the jet and those nice people at the rest of us are treated as though we have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these democrats are the thing between us and the end of the world it is

preparing the ground one senior diplomat told the guardian the guidelines would be a trade off between speed and the guidelines remain flexible they are easier to if they are very they are likely to take more diplomats are keenly following fallout in the some say they have been shocked by the media response to the high court decision on role and the limited of judges the welsh law officer has strongly the attacks on the high court and explained why he wants to be able to make representations at the supreme court member counsel general for said the had been deliberately misrepresented by some he there are those who have deliberately chosen to misrepresent the facts to challenge the independence of the one of the cornerstones of our democratic parliamentary system the reporting of this judgment in some newspapers was frankly a disgrace and an insult to the good name of democratic structure of the and indeed this assembly is built on a foundation of the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system the tragic recent history of is littered with examples of countries that overthrew the rule of law and undermined the independence of the courts that road is not a democratic one and leads only in one direction i would hope those who may have made comments and statements in will want to to the assembly in why he wants to appear in person at the supreme court i consider that this case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the united kingdom and the legal framework for think it is of paramount importance to at this point that despite the political furore surrounding it and the frankly alarming tone of much of the press as the high court itself this case involves a pure question of law it is not concerned with the merits and demerits of leaving the union and the politics surrounding sole legal question at issue is whether the government can as a matter of constitutional law use the prerogative powers to give notice of withdrawal from the union in seeking to intervene in any the welsh government will seek to reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of established principles of constitutional that the welsh government was not seeking to reverse the result of the referendum he having outlined what the case is about i should also make a comment on what it is not about the first minister has made crystal clear and i repeat that sentiment the welsh government respects the result of the referendum and this is absolutely not about overturning that decision the legal commentator has posted a good story on his page he says that the lord chancellor and justice is being sued by six high court judges for age discrimination two of the judges are also claiming sexual discrimination and racial discrimination is an extract from post all the claims relate to reduced benefits the judges can expect to receive under a new judicial pension scheme introduced last hearing has been arranged before a tribunal judge who is not affected by the new pension arrangements there could be further hearings before appeal thought to be unprecedented for serving judges to sue the lord chancellor and the ministry of justice turning back to the ifs report this is interesting a table showing how many of the fiscal targets set by the treasury since 1997 have been met success and failure of treasury fiscal targets since 1997 ifs counts 12 targets in and concludes that only two of them have been hit both were rolling targets that did not involve balancing the budget in a given but setting plans that involved balancing the current budget

to become the 45th president of the united or trump has to win 270 electoral college votes the candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor probably if a or a mandatory prepare for constitutional remind me how the electoral college works each state is assigned a certain number of electoral ultimately based on its population has the with 55 seven states north south and have just three electoral votes gets three there are 50 states in the most of these are republican or democrat they vote the same way every time going back at least six elections so the presidential election boils down to just a handful of the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both republicans and democrats this is why voters in places such as north and new are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops also why you have not seen and trump holding rallies in or twitter how does the us electoral college faces a much more difficult path to victory he needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next whereas if wins two or she wins the race this is because democrats start from a stronger position there are 18 states plus that have voted for a democrat for president in every election since 1992 that batch amounts to 242 electoral votes there are only 13 states that have voted for a republican in every election since 1992 those states carry just 102 electoral simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent then adds has 29 electoral she is the next president if she loses but and north she will be the next needs to hold on to all the historically republican win states such as and which are usually republican but where he has struggled in the polls and then win enough swing states to tip him over closing et in because now the real fun polls close in eastern and most of of each state are on central so the polls there close at running is the governor of in the past 50 years the state has voted democrat only once for in some states we will know the winner almost immediately after the polls close most news including the rely on the associated press to races is able to announce the winners so quickly because it deploys thousands of people on election night to collect results from counties and locales as they are announced it also uses exit polls and voting history solidly democratic or republican states are likely to be called quickly swing states are likely to take trump drink but trump have to worry about the prospect of a trump presidency a nice way to toast and if you were minded to do so the builder might be to mix up a cocktail as you settle in for the night got cinnamon schnapps and orange juice but the most fun bit is the cotton candy on top it look just like his twitter the cocktail it could be a long or a short one but at this stage we likely do not yet so our advice is to fuel yourself for a not a sprint and you can feed yourself and prominent role in us elections by preparing a chili a more take on your traditional brought to by in the if drinking more than one of you will want to line your rolling you always get what you want a perfect to election given that both candidates are incredibly unpopular with the public trump likes the rolling stones and played this song at his rallies the rolling stones do not like and asked him to stop he et ends in three key swing and new a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 29 electoral college votes have proved crucial in the recent past gore can tell you that he narrowly lost the state some still believe he actually won and the election to w despite winning the national popular vote away from the top of the senator and republican presidential candidate is up for he has been running a bit ahead of democrat in the polls who resigned as chair of the democratic national committee in after leaked emails showed the party favoring is expected to comfortably win to was a reliably republican state until won there in 2008 and again in 2012 the mix of rural wealthy federal government employees and military and so on make it difficult to but has been decisively ahead this year new has been won by a democrat in five of the past six presidential elections but the granite state gave trump his first big primary and recent polling here has shown a tight race twitter spice things up states closing at et include south and home state sanders won the democratic primary in by an amazing 73 points but now with has a cocktail called dirty little a vodka martini with hot sauce in a reference to an interview in where said she always carried a bottle of hot sauce you could quip to your friends that a perfect as the race is to heat et close in west north and expect the result from west very quickly trump should win easily north and are swing states and will take longer has been seen as a reliable bellwether voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964 that run might be coming to an either because of the changing demographics or because of the strangeness of the current in

moderate to deliver the first democratic presidential victory in the lone star state since even beats trump in where pious voters decide at the moment of truth that they cannot vote for a candidate who wants to them by the republican leaders get on the day after the election and declare that the nomination of trump was a historic mistake thousands of words are spilled haranguing republicans for nominating a candidate whose appeal to the base may have been strong but who obviously was not a serious contender to lead so great and diverse a nation final electoral twitter the trump bank which trump wins the 270 electoral college votes he needs to grab the keys to the white house with a surprise victory in the upper despite failing to convert in the more familiar battleground states of and in this squeaker trump owes his electoral life to white voters especially rural white voters as the night grows trump realizes that he has lost and owing to a strong vote against him both places he has lost because there are too many people in the suburbs who have some actual experience of the federal government and who are horrified to their teeth at the idea of his taking the white house surprisingly strong turnout among trump supporters in the white communities of has failed to push trump over the democratic wall of and its suburbs but trump has performed strongly all night in the battleground states that winning north and and luck trump picks up a single electoral vote in rural one of two states that split their electoral votes against all odds and the predictions of most he pulls off an upset win in which has not gone republican in a presidential election since but which is more homogeneously white than its neighboring where ends up having failed to inspire voters in to turn up on election and where republican governor political machine has once again succeeded final electoral twitter the which blood pressure climbs to before finally reports a conclusive win for at handing her 29 electoral votes and the white house twitter how does the us electoral college one be pleasant has had some expected victories over the course of the bagging and and the states she was supposed to win in the upper and seeing all the talk of a strong early vote for democrats in come true the people who were supposed to vote for her are voting for her nonwhite educated white voters and no reason she win but the night has been over and by signals that have made democratic eyes twitch the independent voters of new have responded to and concluded that really rather not have a dynasty in politics they give trump four electoral votes then trump wins north where there admittedly are plenty of white republican where republican efforts to quash voting have succeeded be if lost it in how was supposed to win it gets really when the result comes in a large share of voters in suburbs are registered and maybe had the same kind of feeling new have enough with the so stalls out at 266 electoral votes trump gets to 243 and all eyes are on nonwhite voters in turned up at the polls as they might have turnout among white voters in retirement communities has proven absolutely crushing the vote around seems to have failed to materialize and still counting and st then final results in where won by more than 260 , 000 votes in come and the state is clearly trump cries foul but nobody can hear him through the cacophony of popping corks final twitter the which gets the constitutional crisis implicitly promised the moment who has been involved in more than 4 , 095 according to one set foot on his golden escalator the election turns out to be close closer than anyone would have thought maybe trump wins new and makes a sweep of the other battleground save to produce a 269 269 electoral vote tie or maybe which even in the relatively placid year of 2012 took four days to report its election comes down to a margin like the one that separated gore and bush in resulting in fights over absentee ballot a refusal to concede on either side the mother of all legal battles the 2016 election cycle has proven its ability to soar beyond the human and surely no mere mortal can comprehend how hairy things could get the most horrible scenarios appear to lie down the path of an electoral tie what happens nobody really knows while the constitution prescribes that congress shall step in to resolve such a and while a couple of early elections were close enough for congress to get there really are no applicable precedents since presidents are technically chosen by electors who meet to cast formal votes in it is conceivable that a might break a tie in favor by going against the will of his or her voters but then congress must formally count the ballots in and if but one senator and one representative disagree with the each chamber must vote on the validity of the count you see where this is going this is a congress that cannot so much as tie its much less leap constitutional hurdles would a result

when will we know the us goes to the polls on results will start to come in on from about in when some states close their polling stations on the eastern seaboard of the us some states with clear majorities for or trump will be called very quickly depending on how close it is and how certain key states the final result could be known anywhere between and the early evening bear in mind that in is midnight in new so it is likely that and trump will speak to supporters sometime late afternoon be getting results from and from around noon though it may take a while to know who has won in either place if trump pulls off a surprise in he will be in a strong position the result in will be a big indicator one way or the followed by new and north many states will call early at about will win if going to win the this could put her ahead on the day for the first time we may well have a result by twitter how does the us electoral college is the us electoral of it has nothing to do with schools or universities it is not a building or a but rather a way of counting votes in the presidential state is worth a certain number of electoral college votes if a candidate wins a then that candidate wins all of that electoral college votes my year with covering a curiosity that became a dark phenomenon read number of electoral college votes a state gets is based on its population size a state gets a vote for each of its house of representatives districts plus two votes for its two senators the more people in a the more members of the house of representatives it has and the more electoral college votes it has 55 north has has has and so on there are 538 electoral college votes in total that means the first candidate to reach 270 electoral college votes wins the presidential election there have been cases in which there is an electoral college in when finally emerged as and more in the sitcom veep in a tie would likely look more like the latter than the former is it possible to win the popular vote but not the electoral college just as labor under won the popular vote in the 1998 election but win a majority in the a presidential candidate in the us can win the popular vote but fall short in the electoral college vote this has happened four times in us 1888 and when w bush beat gore in the electoral college despite losing the popular vote can trump really voters in could have crucial role in tight us election race read he could though it looking likely in the past week lead has largely off the back of the announcement that it was reopening an investigation into her email server some national polls have even showed trump drawing even with her but has consistently led in the electoral and many polls project her electoral college result at 270 or more most polls now project trump at 200 to 215 electoral college making his task of winning 270 more difficult a blue state and what is a red the 2000 election the us media have used the red and blue to depict how states are likely to vote democratic states are shown in blue republican states are shown in red because red is usually the of the and blue is traditionally the of the right if i look at one of those electoral college it looks as though trump is winning everywhere a sea of red going on is winning a lot of states but many of the states he is winning are not full of people so they have small numbers of electoral college votes by has a of including new and are swing and which ones are states are like marginal seats the ones on a knife edge that can swing between the two parties sometimes they are referred to as purple states mixture of red and swing states to watch in this election are north and new only needs to win all the blue states plus one of these swing states to win the whereas trump needs to win all the red states and all of these swing states to reach 270 do actually there is no consistent method of voting across the with each state running their elections polling hours will vary by city or county as well some states use paper as does some use electronic where it looks as though the voter is using an three states and conduct voting by mail for though in voters also have the option of attending a polling us election how much do you remember from the presidential read states use punch card where the voter uses an implement to punch a hole through the ballot which is then read by a device first time i voted in a us election from the state of mailed me a punch a pad and a metal spike so i could cast my this form of voting gave rise to the term a in when result was challenged on a number of bases including whether a vote was valid if the punch seem to go all the way through the only voting for are voting for a wide range of measures and local tax levies for should the county impose a tax to provide more funds to the local state should the state county officials such as coroners and dog catchers judges they elect judges in governors states are voting for governors this state legislators voting for your state all 435 members of the federal house of elected every two 34 federal voting for your local state federal government and in several state and local plebiscites all at the equivalent of what are voting for tomorrow a
the us election might not end tomorrow anyone who lived through the of when it took until for a winner to be declared and only then by a ruling of the supreme court will know that a presidential contest does not always produce a at least not right away but one thing will certainly be over and that is the sometimes saga that has been the 2016 is standard to describe a us presidential contest as bitter and divisive in the story branded the battle of v mitt of the most closely fought and in recent looking that race looks like a veritable philosophy exemplary in its civility and compared with this one twitter search for successor has been a horror show of bullying and the bigotry a crowded the 2016 campaign stands out as unusually awful it has been whether followed from a distance or covered up close those who say it has unfolded like a drama in real time are not exaggerating except no drama would have dared offer this cast of characters a tycoon with a crush on a an investigated for an underage a former miss universe humiliated as or the reversals of fortune campaign 2016 has made house of cards look that cannot conceal the the search for successor has been a horror revealing and dredging up a stew of misogyny and casual violence bubbling below the surface of life eight in 10 us voters say the campaign has left them feeling according to a times poll last week not dissatisfied the platonic ideal of an election is a sober discussion of the questions that will confront the us over the next decade the reality has been a marathon of threat and trump poses the greatest threat to all our futures letters read blame for this belongs to one man trump has fought a presidential campaign like no other he has mocked opponents for their belittled disparaged war damned ethnic and other minorities in bigoted jeered at disabled beaten his chest with bellicose promises of violence that would trample on the us constitution and trigger a third world and told dozens and dozens of lies every day while his opponent has offered detailed and substantive policy those have barely got a knack for hogging media usually by saying or tweeting something has left no room in the hours of formal presidential debates between trump and climate change was discussed for not one trump does not bear the blame alone also shamed by the 2016 campaign are those institutions and individuals who failed to stand up to him some understood the danger he seeing in him a dictator alone can fix whose contempt for basic democratic from the importance of a free press to the need to respect the outcome of a democratic suggested a lurch towards fascism that small handful will be remembered with admiration whatever the outcome historians of the republic will judge harshly those who did not stop trump when they could it will damn those who pampered and enabled him to reach this where polls still show him with a albeit to the white house twitter bush was among the republican rivals who had no idea how to deal with trump in this of shame is the republican party among those hanging their heads should be the 16 rival candidates who allowed themselves to be steamrollered by a reality host and serially bankrupted businessman and the others had no idea how to deal with trump they collectively made a strategic error by failing to their primary task was to take him out they fought each each hoping to emerge as the candidate around whom republicans would unite that proved a poll lead increased in late 2015 and early his rivals grew ever more frightened of taking a shot at anxious that they might alienate his supporters that he might train his fire back on them so mocked on a debate stage in new in trump could literally step back and watch only to emerge as the winner in that republican primary a few days later twitter trump rival and new jersey governor the republicans cannot be blamed for the weakness of the field that fought trump for their nomination perhaps no traditional politician no senator or governor could take on trump when the republican so furious at the political were hungering for an outsider of this this loathing of all things was itself stoked for years by republicans and their allies on fox news and in the rest of the conservative complex in losing their party to the republicans were burned by a fire they themselves had what shames them is their conduct afterwards even as trump made clear what kind of man he is calling suggesting are too lazy to that see everything through the lens of calling women and threatening violence against endorsing torture and the murder of the families of suspected calling for a foreign power to hack into emails belonging to his political arguing that women who have abortions should some sort of and being exposed as a proud perpetrator of sexual a man whose approach to women is to them by the even after all this and so much most senior republicans of note stood by be they condemned him when the extremity of their standard left them no alternative who serves as speaker of the house of rightly called it the definition of a racist when trump said that judge could not be impartial in handling the lawsuit against the trump university because was in the judge was a us born in trump after the release of the access tape in which trump boasted of his attacks on women but he never repudiated him fully never said trump was unfit to be president of the united states and that he would not vote for him twitter senator john initially endorsed trump j same was nearly true of senator john tortured

there has arguably not been a us presidential election with so much at stake for the rest of the world since the second world war one candidate stands largely for she would do slightly more than her predecessor to shore up the existing liberal world order her opponent is vowing to turn that order on its jettisoning alliances and free trade while seeking to cut deals with the authoritarian trump is elected on it is likely to trigger a foreign policy crisis inside as the diplomatic and security establishments scramble to discover whether he meant what he said on the campaign trail those who believe that the election talk was all bluster and that trump will tack back to a more traditional republican foreign policy once elected are likely to be according to an analyst at the institution in us trump and in tight race on campaign 's final day live read more view is he is a more ideological candidate than we often appreciate and while there is a lot of bluster and a lot of ignorance on a wide number of there are certain things that he has been pretty consistent wright said think he is opposed to us alliances and i think he would try to withdraw the us from security commitments around the world he is and he would veer towards a more and he is he is some believe that trump would be confronted with a series of resignations by diplomats and generals if he tried to turn these campaign platforms into administration policy on the other wins the electoral college she will face the opposite how to distinguish her foreign policy from she has expressed an inclination toward a tougher stance in and in for but the for a change of policy has shrunk with every passing week as has sought to create new facts on the ground in the last stages of the era more weeks would go by while a new administration dives into an inevitable policy review events around the globe may not wait that long whoever sits down at the desk in the oval office on 20 next year may be forced to take some of the toughest decisions any us president has much sooner than he or she would faces host of global threats during transition until next president read power and influence is being challenged around the world at an accelerating and nowhere more so than on the peninsula the north has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so they will soon it is also widely anticipated that in the next few north will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us west coast former and current us administrations have taken the strategic decision that should be prevented from reaching that by force if necessary but the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next foreign policy advisers have that she would focus on the looming crisis early in her term in reassuring japan and south that the us will not abandon and seeking to put pressure on china to enforce trade sanctions more effectively that may well not leaving a administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of with and accepting its nuclear weapons as long as it restricts missile development if that were it would alarm us allies who are already within north missile allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if trump reaches the oval office he has questioned the value of us alliances in the and he has floated the possibility that countries like japan or south should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the us strategic umbrella if he sticks to that policy in there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in and possibly beyond a trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a north missile he has said he would put more pressure on china to get tough with its and he has said he is willing to meet in the on the grounds a or a chance that i can talk him out of those damn he has he is quite willing to contemplate using the us nuclear arsenal if the weapons cannot be he why are we making why do we make china china tantalized by us election mayhem and prospect of trump as president read his or her first year in a new us president would also face a direct challenge to us power in the western pacific the of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the south china sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world us influence is under further threat by the rise of in the who has threatened to eject us casting doubt on his agreement to allow new permanent presence likely policy will be to continue faltering to and to restoring the faith of us allies in the region that will help them resist attempts to dominate the south china sea it is a policy that is held hostage to some extent by ultimate and it could lead to a rapid escalation of tension in the region trump has pointed to the as a reflection of us weakness but has not said what he would do about it he has focused more on the threat posed to the us by its trade relations with china in the transactional model of foreign relations trump he could agree to turn a blind eye to creeping takeover in the south china sea in exchange for a bilateral trade deal with on better terms why plans for zones in could provoke conflict read new us president will arrive
not long after he launched his rocket of a campaign last trump walked into a gathering of hardcore conservative activists in meeting a businessman with no clear ideological the crowd could have been

economist of analytics the election of the republican candidate for president would like the vote to leave the an event that not but that is very while also being very uncertain in terms of precisely what it means for us now and into the given that stock markets loathe uncertainty above all the initial reaction to a trump victory as with the vote would be a stock market kind of wave of emotionally

that departure from the united kingdom happen overnight and that it would take years to negotiate a new relationship with its trading partners in but the united states is a different kind of animal a much larger for one about a quarter of global and some half of the value of all the stocks traded in the world are us changing hands on us stock exchanges add to that the fact that a lot of investors

would affect business investment and hiring says a former adviser to republican presidential candidate john one is sure what kind of specific policy decisions president trump would make and businesses would pause until they got more clarity that would slow economic longer the outlook depends on what choices a president trump would make what form would his stance if trump chooses to follow through on all his policies deporting undocumented building a wall along the border it could shrink the size of the us economy or trigger a trade war is what markets will worry about says chief economist of financial services we were to impose tariffs or quotas on imported our trading partners would likely and our exports to those like china and would there would be no global growth would slow trump has promised that he would cut taxes if which sounds appealing to voters that has the potential to give the consumer sector at least a brief to the extent that those tax cuts are significant enough to register for individual and if those people choose to spend their windfall but notes that tax plan is set up to benefit wealthy most many economists believe that changes in tax policy have less effect on spending by affluent households also the pesky question of how trump would pay for those tax cuts is not at all clear how he would do says you just run higher that would be a a surging stock market

accomplish will be governed by the makeup of congress he abrogate existing trade like the trade pact between the and he could find working with congress to pass some of the more protectionist measures that investors find so terrifying to be far harder than he expects the idea of president is one that investors have had plenty of time to accustom themselves and the democratic policies are clearly

include his vision of the us has for one of dystopia he even described the as a crisis worse than the great depression but amid all this desolation trump gains three things he fuels doubt and leaving people he denigrates his opposition en blaming the world on and he raises himself up above the nonexistent wreckage big a man who once took a joke about the size of his hands too trump spends a lot of time trying to look as large as from his worth estimates to crowds at his rallies and his success in meaningless is pierced throughout by paperwork in the guardian found that trump valued a new golf course at in one document and at in a court filing sued to pay lower on the new times reported similarly huge discrepancies in his reported income the post has shown repeatedly that boasts of charitable giving have virtually nothing behind has also falsely bragged of endorsements from federal agencies and claimed environmental and tried the ploy in he has called the millions his father

independent voters and experts he often cites news stories about and even praised in a presidential debate for catching her in a every trump says the cameras refuse to show his even though his campaign forces cameras to stay within a small where they pan to show the crowd as anyone at his rallies or watching can see only one camera at each event stays fixed on the shared whose footage

together this is apparently the desired a haze of noxious even if no one has found fire for all that smoke for more than 20 journalists and congressional republicans have tried the latter have spent tens of millions of taxpayer dollars investigating the associations and careless email practices but have yet to find criminal conduct arguably worst conspiracy is his insistence that voter fraud has the which merges his fringe claims with his attack on institutions no evidence supports the claim of widespread fraud and the decentralized electoral college makes such a conspiracy functionally impossible but the claim gives trump something to blame failure on besides himself like his other it sows doubt and diminishing the nation so that trump can portray himself as an favorite escape from this maze is the phrase something going which lets trump suggest claim ignorance

normally seeing the people she normally but knowing that many of them had voted leave something she saw as anathema she likened them to she thought she knew and understood the people she lived but clearly she twitter a chart showing the drop in the pound against the us dollar in on 24 the day after the referendum was the disbelief and it quickly gave way to anger how could voters be so how could they swallow all the leave lies about giving more money to the people were never really told what leaving the would mean the fine detail the question of v questions about the status of citizens already here and citizens living in the the role of parliament in determining the terms on which we leave are only now being if it can be called in the months leading up to the vote on 23 was laughably simplistic an immensely complex decision had been reduced to a binary vote the referendum was a fiasco and should never have been called losing his job as prime minister sufficient punishment for who had called the referendum to try to salve wounds in the conservative party and then led a campaign to keep us in he should have been locked up in the tower of anger only gets you so far thinking back to the one image stuck in my mind the day before the vote been shopping in a high street close to where i live in noticed a young man with a clipboard i assumed he was a student at the local university walking up and down the street handing out leaflets and and talking to passersby he was campaigning for remain one person trying to do something for the cause he believed i felt because i had done nothing to try to keep in the a cause in which i passionately believed i had assumed my fellow zombies would be too sensible to swallow the leave nonsense and and vote to quit the i that i and all of us deserved what i had got our arrogance had lost us the in which i live had been festooned with leave posters the leavers really wanted this and were prepared to make public their preference in sporting they were up for it the then leader said his supporters would over broken to get to polling stations to vote to leave the and he was right leave may not have had the arguments on their but they had all the energy who put up posters or show any passion for their were supine in the face of their rhetoric best lack all while the worst are full of passionate how right all this remind you of trump may talk nonsense a lot of the but no denying his passion and rhetorical skill i watched several of the debates involving the republican and he was incredibly bullish and entertaining there was no denying he was box office in an age increasingly suspicious of and with people in the struggling to stay afloat and looking for simple is an attractive of which led me to the phase now at believing that as guilty as every other the guy with the for the catastrophe of 23 and eager to join the battle to rectify the mistake we had a referendum in 1975 to stay in the forerunner of the we decided to leave in 2016 in my book that makes the referendum score and there is still all to play for i believe that once people see the damage leaving would do to the economically and sentiment will will do all i can to help shift that sentiment writing arguing the remain getting involved in some of the now springing up we are the insurgents we have the passion and the energy the leavers are in the but can be harder than attack if the attackers are as we will have to this third following denial and i have never felt so i have found a cause in which i truly believe economic growth for our common social good i am even typing this in a that displays the 12 stars on a blue background that signify the union i feel i owe it to that student who worked so hard while the rest of us did nothing he saw the danger of we arrogantly assumed life would go on as normal the things that matter in life have to be fought if trump does your fault just as i have to that i

actually have been awoken this year by rhetoric the bad news is that the such a vital element in the coalition built by in his two successful presidential is relatively sluggish this time as is turnout for young voters the fall in black turnout could be especially perilous for in swing states such as north which has been identified by both candidates as a key early voters change their as trump has and have they trump is trying to use the furor over the renewed interest in emails to persuade those early voters feeling remorse to switch their preference that you see that was a big

possibility of a constitutional crisis with many dimensions and deleterious consequences should secretary win the is a narrative eagerly pushed by the republican campaign would be under protracted criminal investigation and probably a criminal i would say so have a criminal trial of a sitting trump claimed at a rally in where he quoted trump is open to accusations of creating the potential for his own constitutional crisis too he caused consternation among republican politicians at the final presidential debate when he refused to say whether he would accept the result of the election if he there is as little evidence for claims as there currently is for his theory that has found a of new evidence against both issues are firing up an already angry base to levels of suspicion not seen in

the news is hard to escape these with many people hearing about world events not just from news websites but also on social media platforms but what impact is this having on could be making them more according to the service it reported an increase in the number of children seeking help for with concern around world affairs such as the referendum and conflict thought that the rise is down to a combination of personal and political while the charity said others felt it was also partly due to disturbing events seen in the media and on social asked parents and grandparents about their experience of and how they try to calm children down about world and do your children express fears over global read from granddaughter loses sleep over terrorist am a former working with people who suffered serious and am now a novelist my eldest aged is extremely anxious about political particularly potential terrorist attacks she has become worried about on the tube in when she visits me she is also worried about going into big shopping because of the threat of bombs and was deeply concerned after the attacks she is not at all frightened by any supposed threat she is rather having many which is a good and reassuring aspect of modern but she is insecure about being suddenly attacked in a place that she previously experienced as familiar and fun she loves coming to but feels being there is nowadays more dangerous these concerns affect her sleep she has confided she has periods of lying worrying about terrorism and reassurances that it will not happen to her do and in my view dispel her concerns my experience of working with trauma convinces me that anxiety needs to be addressed and not given a superficial bandage of comfort my granddaughter have a computer or or direct access to the web on her but inevitably she sees the news with her parents and hears about happening in school from other children who tend to big up scary events she absorbs often false or exaggerated information from her peers who have access to social media while she cannot check out the truth what they say in my the current state of the world needs to be discussed in schools as well as at and the spreading of and gossip about scary events needs to be addressed more fully as a serious element in the school curriculum teachers need to rethink how children are introduced to political world events now there is so much greater access to them more consideration needs to be given to the way social which can now feed into a bullying affects children bullying is hardly a novel phenomenon in schools but i think we are really up to speed with the way political events can be deployed to terrify the less well informed or the more sensitive there needs to be greater education on civic responsibility for everyone and i believe for the sake of a responsible future society it should start at a younger age children need to be taught to look at the news and public reactions critically and not take them at face in the way they were once taught to be critical of from daughter gets more anxious about issues such as global who turns eight next watches the news when i so in the morning and evening she also watches most days we do talk about the headlines a she takes an interest in what is going on around the does worry about some of the stuff she just yesterday at bedtime we spoke about the us election and the wall trump wishes to build between and it lead on to us chatting about the wall and the great wall of china my daughter is very inquisitive so talking about news is an simple way to give her some insight and pass on some of my like watching clips of but she will still listen to what the report is saying she is quite sensitive so if there is a piece on for and i think the images are her i will ask her if she would like to watch something be honest she gets more anxiety from topics touched on in such as global warming and natural disasters we go to visit her in twice a year and much of the news recently has been about the earthquake there she has become very fixated about this and i been able to reassure her about her uncle lives in so understandable that she would worry but definitely made her afraid of something similar happening to her when from sons worry they will end up as refugees and no one will take care of who are five and had a shocking about three months ago that the war in was real they had been in the room with me and my husband when we were discussing the decision to launch in we were watching footage about the civilian casualties and condemning the decision they have lots and lots of questions about politics and boys went away to play for a while and must have got talking because they came back into the living room shortly afterwards very people are dying in with real guns and they had got confused between and because of how war is depicted in video games and the fact that they have toy guns my son started to need to stop the shops and the government from selling things that try to make war and bombs and guns fun because real mum happening in not the first time the news has made them my boys worry a lot about war and nuclear weapons they also worry that they might end up refugees too and no one will love them or want them they have lots and lots of questions about politics and weapons i shield them from current affairs and i lie to but instead spend

years of experience and what i want in a president someone who is intelligent and informed about both policy and process a trump presidency would be a as so fond of saying i get no sense that he has any knowledge or the desire to learn the issues at all truly frightening trump would further divide our nation his rhetoric alone has deepened existing divides we must remember the richness immigrants have brought to our country the first priority of the next president must be to unify as nothing can be accomplished in the current atmosphere this has been the ugliest campaign i have witnessed in my 51 years campaign has been embarrassing and dangerous and it will take a while for the nation to recover one good thing that has come of this cycle is that it has woken people up from apathy and

been doing since 2008 but if he it would be in directions i defeating encouraging businesses to stay or return a much better relationship with and the disestablishment of the politically correct society we to our become a priorities should be protecting the land and and promoting the general welfare stateside i have found the campaign absolutely horrid the only good thing about election day

this election is the worst ever and i lived through and the war racism and general ignorance astound me worried that attempt to influence the outcome of this election in favor might yet succeed i know

proportion of voters who make no secret of their reluctant whether grudging sanders or voters of any persuasion who oppose trump only marginally more than they do despite having backed sanders i take a less noncommittal far from being the of two is a remarkably intelligent candidate whose views largely mirror my a stark contrast to the unsympathetic view of her character that is frustratingly widespread her proposed policies demonstrate forward thinking that would enable the united states to stand upright as a respected model among nations i anticipate with hope the improvement of the affordable care act to make universally the push to end gun the increase in police the reform of our prison and a social promotion that advances race rights and gender equity none of these changes can be expected under the influence of who sees the truth as promotes his sexism and narcissism as and in the is excessively volatile and unprincipled embarrassing that whose political competence is nigh

nobody thinks trump will win the but we do tend to gloss over the fact that we still expect something like 50 million people to vote for him some of them are my i live in which will probably vote for trump if history is any indication its of 23 , 500 or has a per capita income of around and of my live below the poverty line one of those places where the coal dried up a few decades ago however depressing it better than it a trump good people in a feedback loop of paranoia and hate read house my children will grow up in was built in 1900 by their paternal belonged to the family ever each generation building on as needed from its original single room there are a few houses like that in the and we moved into this one mostly because we wanted our kids to grow up as he running barefoot through the woods and catching tadpoles in the stream behind the house is still an old place like that not uncommon for friends our age to live in houses recently made available by a family death we buy groceries from a general but miles to the nearest gas station or people here would vote for a villain if they ran on the republican ticket party affiliation is an inherited trait in many families some just like trump he what his supporters which baffles many given what the man but makes perfect sense if you that most of my pay nearly as much attention to politics as writing this and who are reading it many people are uncomfortable with a lot of the stuff heard about him but accept it as a necessary the main thing is to tell elites that not safe in their sinecures any that the common man is about to have his day all gone too far off the the county lies just over the river from west tried to come to but the council voted against it because they want to lose the small businesses lining the main street the company went to mason instead and pointedly positioned its store at the end of the intentionally quaint riverfront downtown now features a rundown some a liquor empty storefronts and a few improbably expensive shops all the tax revenue from the goes to talk about economic insecurity and usually imagining some angry white man upset that someone somewhere a and a woman to is getting more help than him but i picture that where it really matter what the people wanted they made their they got run over anyway a fair description of life in a place like this who admire trump for his business acumen are simply pointing out that no matter the ambiguity about his balance sheets this is a man who flies around on a which to someone making a few hundred dollars a week seems like unimaginable wealth our society values a human based on their material why then are we surprised when many people define and and is a test of fears to the population his slogan about making great again brings memories of last when the downtown bustled and anyone could make a solid assuming they too lazy to present themselves at the mine it ever an easy but it ever this hard difficult to given everything that has happened but trump exploded on to the stage with the first primary debate by telling us that the political system really is as rigged as that politics is about who you can buy and whose influence you can tap we have all known trump said it and where he built his been three years since i wrote a post about poverty trap that went viral and led to a book deal i now have the luxury of paying attention to the world around me but when i look at my hands i see the scars from knives and slicers and hot and i remember the rage that i could not name after a decade and a half of low wages and no because we all say that we live in a meritocracy and we all know but it keeps people sinking regardless it was bound to happen that a candidate running on fear would take us this far into the realm of the unfortunate fact of or at least the kind we practice in the western is that we below are turned against each other there is political value in racial strife as long as we can teach white people to hate nonwhite then we have to worry about poor people they outnumber the rich came to love trump because he speaks openly of the racial strife that politicians have been exploiting and stoking for decades to great electoral effect what people mean when they complain about political after all supposed to hate and fear a bunch of people but not talk about which is nonsensical except in the lens of where perception matters far more than substance twitter what a trump campaign rally reveals about can behave as badly as he wants no worse than people expect from the power elite as

is an astrophysicist who is the director the of planetarium in new a committed science he frequently appears on us television shows and has published 13 the latest of which is called this summer a potentially planet called b was found orbiting the nearest star to our sun at a distance where liquid water could exist on its surface some have mooted it might be habitable what do you say we need to know a little bit more about nearby like and some nearby moons within our solar like around or these have properties that could support life as we know but in its extremes extreme extreme dehydration or extreme radiation and if we find life in our solar that bodes very well for life being ubiquitous then practically any planet we find that has been around long go there expecting to find life rather than simply wondering if it is there says we will put a man on mars under a president yet to be determined with a budget not yet has reiterated the goal of sending humans to mars by the and to bring them back that seems to say the am critical of it in a different way is saying we will put a man on mars in under the leadership of a president yet to be on a budget line not yet established i like that somebody is dreaming that but i know the cost to him of making that promise so i have my that it would actually come to we go back to the moon think we should remind ourselves how to go to the but i think mars is vastly more because it has evidence of running water had water for billions of years always wanted to keep mars in our even if we do choose to go back to the you go to but only after the person who made the spaceship had sent their mother i am not an early adopter of stuff that has never been done but i am glad we have bold people who live and walk among us who do take those risks we would never have left the cave were it not for folks such as is going to get to mars my read of the only thing that will get to mars first is a space such as and because it has never been done not with people it is expensive and it has unquantified risks when all three of those are operating there is no business model that you can establish i think what is much more likely to unfold is the government wants to go to and other companies want to build the spaceship and pays them for it their business model is selling to the is some debate around what life might look like elsewhere in the there might be intelligent life in the form of artificial intelligence or microbes your like it all if earth is any kind of example at then most life find would be microbial but consider also that if you can make a robot that knows how to make a robot from natural resources and you sent this robot off to a planet and it lands and makes three more of itself and they want to go to three other you could populate the entire galaxy in a relatively short amount of time twitter chief musk unveils his plans to mars during the international astronautical congress in in musk and hawking have voiced concerns about how about am completely relaxed i would claim that will rise solving bits of challenges that we have put in our way and those bits in total would be a sort of stunning application of computers in the service of human need is a car going to stand wield a weapon and shoot how we have managed to damage the should we be looking for other places to you want to ship a billion people to mars and have them live there as they are living on have to mars and that means turning mars into an oasis of some kind if you had the power of to mars into then you have the power of to turn earth back into earth so the argument that if we trash earth we need another planet work i am not convinced that escaping earth and leaving others behind to die is the most sensible solution out there with the only way you can undo what people think is but is to vote them out of the have climate change finally been are we all on the same tweeted a couple of weeks ago something that seemed to resonate with people it was something truths are established by objective truths are established by evidence and political truths are established by incessant so you can make anything true that you as long as you repeat it all the time so trump keeps calling her just part of her new name now the first bit is her second name is you repeat this often enough and then you go interview trump supporters and they a new political truth has arisen simply by repetition with the only way you can undo what people think is but is to vote them out of do you think of the i have a slightly different view never see me complaining about someone who is running for office never the issue is not who is or even what their thoughts are the issue is that your fellow citizens are thinking one way versus another in the elections so if you like your gripe is not with trump just a person your gripe is with the of the electorate that wants to vote for him who you should be talking to if people think they are voting in their own interests but are not then they need to be trained how to think about claims made by roasted rapper bob over his claims

ownership of pointing to her repeated comments questioning a key us supreme court decision on gun ownership even liberal second amendment experts have called some of explanations of her position one law professor who supports gun rights put on guns is like a republican politician who claims she supports abortion even as she opposes roe v wade at the final presidential debate last reiterated her position that the supreme court was wrong in its 2008 decision in district of v which overturned ban on handgun as well as a law that required other guns in homes to be a controversial 5 4 the court ruled that have a constitutional right to have and use firearms in their homes for had dodged giving a clear answer about her opinion of the ongoing case during a presidential primary debate in early though she suggested that the supreme court would probably find a full ban on handguns unconstitutional but in the free beacon told an audience at a private event that supreme court is wrong on the second amendment and i am going to make that case every chance i an opinion that is shared by many people including some of the liberal justices on the supreme who argued in their dissent that the second amendment was intended to protect the right of people in each state to form not to limit ability to regulate civilian gun ownership but that particular view is not one that is popular with the general public a poll from 2008 found that of believed the second amendment the rights of to own has stopped short of calling for the supreme court to reverse itself she told fox news in that she did not want to see the heller decision overturned during last she said that she supports individual right to bear comments questioning heller have given the national rifle association and trump continuing fuel for their argument that what she really wants to do is overturn heller and the door for cities and states to private gun twitter how could defeat the gun argument has made repeatedly including at last debate is that she disagrees with the supreme court ruling because of her concern that it might undermine the ability of states and cities to pass safe storage laws to keep guns away from as well as other disagreed with the way the court applied the second amendment in that because what the district of was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store said the court accept that reasonable an explanation that fits narrative of being a champion of safety but several attempts to challenge safe storage laws in court after the heller decision have most recently in in to the litigation director at the law center to prevent gun violence that safe storage law was very similar to previous storage but it included an explicit exemption for other stated gun control priorities including expanded background checks on gun a federal ban on assault and tightening restrictions on gun ownership by domestic abusers are not

have a gun in the home for as articulated in legal said in a statement in in the decision is inconsistent with commonsense laws to prevent gun heller was a crucial symbolic victory for gun rights advocates in terms of constitutional it has had little impact on the broader landscape of gun laws lower courts have upheld the vast majority of gun control laws challenged under heller not clear why

developed which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during was admitted to the hospital and within just a few i developed another complication called the short version being my liver was in danger of and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not had an emergency and was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was and she was and today a wonderful healthy and i feel grateful for that every share this story because this was something in my life that changed me that shaped who i am when i think about this what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my when i think about those days in the hospital the the the the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my most pivotal it horrifies one thing i want for the next hundred i want for no to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone want for no to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government the next hundred i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her why i want to talk about this election tonight because at before in politics have bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned and a candidate who promised to choice between a person who has spent her life in public and a businessman who rips off his perhaps most making a decision between a woman who has said that rights are human and a man who says if you want you can just grab women the a feminist rallying cry right now that i like a and it pussy grabs i know that so much has been made of that and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive those of us here in this room know know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this disrespect of bodily integrity and our bodies are our or make no the conversation that having right now about is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where will be and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human are the two optimistic that on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be exactly what would happen if abortion were made in what has already happened to women like who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to trump claimed that what he said on that access tape was just and later when former new city mayor said that all men talk like men across the country came out to is not normal this is not acceptable men are better than this the feminist future that fighting for has men fighting alongside of men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted when he called women when he called women the media who can so often get things wrong took him to our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked women have been disparaged and harassed for too many and not going to take one more minute of it course this
