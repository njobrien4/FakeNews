washington donald j trump once declared that campaigning for substantial changes to medicare would be a political death wish but with election day behind them , emboldened house republicans say they will move forward on a years old effort to shift medicare away from its open ended commitment to pay for medical services and toward a fixed government contribution for each beneficiary the idea rarely came up during mr trumps march toward the white house , but a battle over the future of medicare could roil washington during his first year in office , whether he wants it or not let me say unequivocally to you now i have fought to protect medicare for this generation and for future generations , senator joe donnelly of indiana , a democrat running for re election in 2018 , said this week in a video message to constituents i have opposed efforts to privatize medicare in the past , and i will oppose any effort to privatize medicare or turn it into a voucher program in the future for nearly six years , speaker paul d ryan has championed the new approach , denounced by democrats as voucherizing medicare representative tom price of georgia , the house budget committee chairman and a leading candidate to be mr trumps secretary of health and human services , has also embraced the idea , known as premium support and democrats are relishing the fight and preparing to defend the program , which was created in 1965 as part of lyndon b johnsons great society they believe that if mr trump chooses to do battle over medicare , he would squander political capital , as president george w bush did with an effort to add private investment accounts to social security after his re election in 2004 democrats will stand firmly and unified against mr ryan if he tries to shatter the sacred guarantee that has protected generations of seniors , said representative nancy pelosi of california , the democratic leader republicans have pressed for premium support since mr ryan first included it in a budget blueprint in 2011 as he envisions it , medicare beneficiaries would buy health insurance from one of a number of competing plans the traditional fee for service medicare program would compete directly with plans offered by private insurers like humana , unitedhealth group and blue cross blue shield the federal government would contribute the same basic amount toward coverage of each beneficiary in a region those who choose more costly options would generally have to pay higher premiums those who choose plans that cost less than the federal contribution could receive rebates or extra benefits supporters say this approach could save money by stimulating greater price competition among insurers , who would offer plans with lower premiums to attract customers democrats say that premium support would privatize medicare , replacing the current government guarantee with skimpy vouchers coupon care for seniors the fear is that the healthiest seniors would choose private insurance , lured by offers of free health club memberships and other wellness programs , leaving traditional medicare with sicker , more expensive patients and higher premiums beneficiaries would have to pay much more to stay in traditional fee for service medicare , said john k gorman , a former medicare official who is now a consultant to many insurers regular medicare would become the province of affluent beneficiaries who can buy their way out of private plans republicans say their proposal would apply to future beneficiaries , not to those in or near retirement but the mere possibility of big changes is causing trepidation among some older americans i am terrified of vouchers , said kim ebb , 92 , who lives in a retirement community in bethesda , md , and has diabetes , atrial fibrillation and irritable bowel syndrome you get a fixed amount of money to draw on for your expenses then you are on your own charles r drapeau , 64 , of east waterboro , me , said he was rattled by the republican plans im scared to death , said mr drapeau , who has multiple myeloma , a type of blood cancer , and takes a drug that costs more than 10 , 000 a month we dont know exactly how it will work , but just the fact that they are talking about messing with medicare , its frightening to me senator richard m burr , republican of north carolina , has proposed a version of premium support , and other republican senators have expressed interest , but the idea has not gained as much traction in the senate as in the house the impact of premium support on medicare beneficiaries depends on details of the plan to be specified by congress a crucial question is how the federal payment would be set the effects would almost surely vary from one market to another , depending on whether private plans cost more or less than the traditional fee for service medicare program mr gorman said that premium support would be a seismic change in medicare and could increase costs for many people in the traditional fee for service program , fueling a big increase in enrollment in private medicare advantage plans enrollment in private plans is already on the rise , having increased more than 55 percent since adoption of the affordable care act in 2010 it is not just republicans who have expressed interest in the idea alice m rivlin , who was the director of the white house office of management and budget under president bill clinton , told congress in 2012 that she favored a bipartisan proposal for premium support because health plans and providers would then seek every possible way to provide higher quality care at a lower cost the nonpartisan medicare payment advisory commission , which advises congress , has explored the idea of premium support and endorsed the principle that medicare payments should be financially
in the run up to the presidential election , new york city was hardly trump territory and every time michael ricatto put another display of trump campaign signs up on the lawn of his sizable white house on abingdon road in kew gardens , queens , last summer , they were stolen or knocked down , actions that would later set off a series of events as unpredictable as the election itself infuriated by the thefts , as well as an obscenity about donald j trump that had been spray painted on the public mailbox in front of his house , mr ricatto installed a security camera it captured a grainy image of a sign stealer mr ricatto , 59 and a real estate investor , then printed fliers bearing the image and a 5 , 000 reward offer for information leading to the arrest of the sign thief he hired some local teenagers to post the signs around the neighborhood with tape when the tape ran out , he said , the teenagers used a stapler to post the fliers to trees on the streets the hubbub made the news , and the stapling method was mentioned in the weeks that followed , a team of enforcement officers from the parks department arrived at mr ricattos house , he said , and issued him 22 summonses with fines totaling 1 , 500 and citing unauthorized posting and minor tree damage to 11 trees to mr ricatto , his real transgression was supporting mr trump , a republican , which he claims annoyed democratic city officials lets call it staple gate , said mr ricatto , who calls himself a conservative , a proud gun owner and a fan of ronald reagan and john wayne a supporter of mr trumps democratic opponent , hillary clinton , would never have been cited in this situation , he fumed , and said that official parks department signs are often affixed to trees with similar staples people in new york city dont like conservatives , he said they wanted to teach me a lesson about being outspoken , and about who i believe in so they found something to hang their hat on mr ricatto said he paid the summonses because i didnt want the headache of fighting them , nor the expense of hiring a lawyer instead of backing down , he splurged on a larger trump banner to hang in front of his house , and he called the prominent civil rights lawyer ron kuby to see if he had any grounds to sue the city for damages claiming political bias in an interview , mr kuby said that he thought the summons was a wild overreaction by the city , but that a suit by mr ricatto claiming selective enforcement based on his trump leanings would be difficult case to make a parks department spokesman dismissed the claim that the summonses were political and called them a routine penalty for damage to the trees the fine had nothing to do with the content of the signs mr ricatto posted and everything to do with the fact that staples can damage and even kill trees , the spokesman , sam biederman , said in a statement he added that the fine was determined by the citys administrative court and not based on the amount of damage or the cost associated , but rather on the rule broken the order to cite mr ricatto set off something of a parallel episode within the parks department an enforcement supervisor ordered a sergeant to write the 22 tickets but the sergeant , joe oro , 54 , refused , arguing that it was improper to write summonses weeks after the signs had been removed , with no witnesses to the violations they were bogus summonses , said sergeant oro , a veteran with 29 years on the job i might as well hit every dog owner who puts up a lost puppy sign he said he also consulted a superior officer , and he told me , stay out of it its too political a rookie officer wound up writing the summons , said sergeant oro , who has had previous run ins with the agency as an outspoken member of his union , local 983 of dc 37 the locals president , joe puleo , characterized department officials as using the officers as pawns for their political favoritism in this case sergeant oro said he was included in an email conversation about possibly forcing mr ricatto to pay 41 , 000 in damage for the staple holes , a proposition that an agency lawyer replied to incredulously , in the email chain as for mr ricatto , president elect trumps victory is a bit of revenge last week , he bought and hung a new , larger banner i told you so , the banner reads trump trump trump trump
this article is part of the opinion today newsletter you can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox many of the initial reactions to donald trumps choice for education secretary betsy devos , an education reform advocate were predictable many conservatives praised her , and many liberals blasted her for anyone who still has an open mind about the politics of education , though , id urge a nuanced , wait and see reaction education reform an inchoate mix of standards , accountability and choice has succeeded in some big ways these successes dont get as much attention as they deserve , which is in part the fault of us in the media we tend to focus on bad news , and to be sympathetic to traditional schools for a very quick sense of the reform movements successes , you can look at the results in washington or new orleans , two laboratories of change \( or read my recent column from boston , which reviews the academic research \) yet those of us who believe these successes are real also need to acknowledge that education reform isnt a magical formula for success some reform oriented schools have failed miserably in particular , some in detroit where devos has been active have evidently failed what separates success and failure \? success depends on a balance of autonomy and accountability , as susan dynarski of the university of michigan says too little autonomy stifles innovation , dynarski tweeted this week too little accountability bad schools proliferate harm students traditional schools often lack both autonomy and accountability they cant make their own decisions about curriculum or personnel , and they can deliver poor results , or great results , year after year with little consequence for principals and teachers devos wants to blow up that system and turn education into more of a free market i agree that more competition and choice would help many parents and students but i worry that devos is drawn to a version of school reform that has its own troubles with accountability she has pushed for vouchers that allow parents to pay for private schools even more than shes pushed for greater autonomy and accountability in the public schools system and there is clear evidence that competitive market forces , by themselves , dont prevent bad schools the market is too complicated parents and students cant always judge what makes a good school and cant easily leave one they have chosen just look at the many poor performing for profit colleges or the fact that michigans version of education reform , which is heavy for profit schools , seems to be performing worse than other states versions choice works best when mixed with oversight the politics of education have turned nasty in recent years , featuring various ideologues who cant be persuaded by evidence devos will obviously bring some strong views to the education department , but heres hoping that she is open to evidence as well no matter how good an idea may seem in theory , it needs to help children in practice
after the stunning disclosures last month that russia had tried to interfere with the election by hacking the democratic national committee , the obama administration hinted at some kind of retaliation so far , however , its only known response has been to publicly identify the russians as the culprits and warn them against interfering again in americas democratic processes president obama should not stop there , as some administration officials suggest he might doing so would allow russia to believe it can operate with impunity in cyberspace and could even invite further hacking because donald trump , an outspoken admirer of vladimir putin , is unlikely to act , it is up to mr obama to hold the russian president to account \( even after intelligence briefings confirming moscows involvement , mr trump refused to blame the russians and said , maybe there is no hacking \) a stronger white house response would begin with mr obama revealing more information about how the hacking was done and by whom he could also decide to disclose russian computer codes , embarrass wealthy kremlin officials by exposing their overseas bank accounts and even disable russian networks and he could impose sanctions on russians who were responsible for the hacking or on military leaders who are bombing civilians in syria whatever he decides , the trick will be to do it without igniting a cyberwar the hacking involved emails from the democratic national committee and from john podesta , hillary clintons campaign chairman , which were then leaked to wikileaks democratic leaders were embarrassed , and mr trumps campaign gained an advantage this was a conscious effort by a nation state to attempt to achieve a specific effect , adm michael rogers , the director of the national security agency , said last week mr obama is said to have chosen a conservative response to this behavior because he did not wish to invite further russian interference in the election nor did he wish to be seen as acting for political reasons at least for now , the warnings appear to have halted further russian cyberattacks and there is an understandable reluctance in the white house to pre empt mr obamas successor by taking additional action americans cannot know for certain that the hacking has ended many experts doubt that warnings alone will be enough to deter mr putin , who has shown no hesitation in challenging america during the postelection transition by continuing to bomb aleppo , in syria , and by installing new nuclear capable missiles in kaliningrad , russia , near the nato border senator lindsey graham has called for congressional hearings to broadly examine russias relationship with the united states , including its role in the hacking , while senator ben cardin has suggested imposing new sanctions regardless of what mr obama decides , congress has a responsibility to pursue paths to ensure that the countrys electoral system is not similarly compromised in the future
on thanksgiving , americans sat down to dinner , looked at the big turkey and thought about donald trump o k , that was totally the wrong attitude were supposed to be having a reset the president elect has been going out of his way to build bridges he came to the times this week for a long conversation , during which he was extremely amiable he blasted the alt right twits who celebrated his victory with nazi salutes \( of course i condemn i disavow and condemn \) he had nothing but praise for barack obama \( i really liked him a lot \) he has no desire to see hillary clinton prosecuted \( she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways \) policywise , he was still the guy whos not all that into position papers in discussing climate change alone , trump used the phrase open mind seven times this is one thing you can count on we havent had a mind so open in the white house since warren harding trump certainly hasnt been giving many hints about what hes actually going to do but the real , and very important , message from his outreach was to remind the nation that hes not crazy trump not crazy ! the word spread throughout the land the stock market soared while its true that the country has generally expected a little more from an incoming president , this election year has always been the story of a very low bar look at his appointments in another year , people might question whether gov nikki haley of south carolina would be the right choice for united nations ambassador , since she has virtually no experience whatsoever in foreign affairs however , given the fact that last week haley appeared to be a finalist for secretary of state , the u n seems like an eminently sensible assignment plus , once again we are relieved its not rudy giuliani ironically , trump , who ran as the big change guy , is spending his first days as president elect trying to assure people the changes wont be too large the mexican wall is going to be a mixture of wall and fences think of it as the great wence the war on illegal immigrants is going to be all about deporting criminals , which is exactly what the obama administration has been doing for years the most astonishing moment in trumps visit to the times came when the president elect announced that waterboarding suspected terrorists was not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think those people would include all the folks who went to trump rallies and cheered when the candidate said things like would i approve waterboarding \? you bet your ass i would it works if its so important to the american people , i would go for it , said the man who spent much of the last year trying to make it important but , he said , hed talked to gen james mattis the odds on bet for secretary of defense and found that mattis thought waterboarding was pretty useless and much less effective than trying to win over a prisoner with cigarettes and beer now , you can look at this two ways one is that we have a president elect who never bothered to talk with any experts about one of his major campaign themes the other is that hes growing into the job lets take the second sure , well probably be disappointed by valentines day , but it could get us through the holidays ive been trying to think of a way to set an example to come up with an olive branch that doesnt go overboard some little thing to smooth the edges before we start fighting about the supreme court and health care over the past couple of years i have noted on several occasions that donald trump once sent me a letter saying i had the face of a dog this was when he took exception to my description of him as a thousandaire ive decided i will refrain from mentioning the incident again until he does something really , really terrible as president in the name of accuracy , however , i have to correct the record i dug out trumps missive the other day and discovered he did not actually say i looked like a dog he said i was a dog and a liar with the face of a pig hard to believe i got that wrong the moral is that you should always consult the primary source so off we go fiscal conservatives are terrified that trump will spend a ton of money on construction projects and refuse to cut entitlements murmurs of the dread term rockefeller republican are probably wafting at paul ryans holiday table perhaps liberals can take comfort in the fact that the other side is just as freaked out as they are next year at this time , well be watching president trump pardon the thanksgiving turkeys unless he reverts and winds up ordering the turkeys tortured
americas first illegal alien amnesty wasnt the biggest in our history , but it was the most influential , since were still talking about it the beneficiaries had shown a certain reckless courage in immigrating here , and a high degree of presumption they entered without permission or papers , ignorant of local laws and customs they didnt learn the language , and they kept to themselves that they were undocumented didnt bother them , so firmly did they believe that no human being is illegal like so many americans , they sanctified their own arrival , blessed their own immigration story above others they were grateful to be accepted by the native born , and glad for the handouts here is their version of how it went down , in 1621 our harvest being gotten in , our governor sent four men on fowling , that so we might after a special manner rejoice together , after we had gathered the fruit of our labors they four in one day killed as much fowl as , with a little help beside , served the company almost a week at which time , amongst other recreations , we exercised our arms , many of the indians coming amongst us , and among the rest their greatest king massasoit , with some ninety men , whom for three days we entertained and feasted , and they went out and killed five deer , which they brought to the plantation and bestowed on our governor , and upon the captain and others and although it be not always so plentiful as it was at this time with us , yet by the goodness of god , we are so far from want that we often wish you partakers of our plenty today , when you celebrate our great american holiday , remember that sense of gratitude if , by ancestral good fortune , your familys foothold in the united states is uncontested , be especially thankful nobodys going to yell at you to speak wampanoag no one will presume criminality in you or your children no one will chant at you build the wall ! thanksgiving is a lovely story we tell ourselves , about kindness and tolerance and white people fitting in the american story got richer and deeper over time , with many grave sins and slaughters , not least for indigenous peoples , but generally hewing to a spirit of growing inclusion and welcome for newcomers how alien that all feels today , in the dawn of donald trumps america
for his second book , john pomfret , a journalist with extensive experience in china , has taken a microscope to an enormous subject the relationship between the united states and china , from 1776 to the present with growing stress points in that relationship and the emergence of strongman leaders in both nations , the book , the beautiful country and the middle kingdom , arrives during a precarious inflection point it is peppered with characters that mr pomfret uses to trace a long historical arc , from howqua , a cantonese tycoon , to herbert yardley , a prominent american cryptographer , and henry m paulson jr , the former united states treasury secretary mr pomfret is scheduled to speak about his book on tuesday at the politics and prose bookstore in washington in an interview , he discussed the history of interactions between the united states and china , president xi jinpings worldview and what china policy might emerge from the trump administration what has been the overarching paradigm of united states china relations from the 18th century to now \? americans and chinese have been enchanting each other and disappointing each other since they first met in 1784 , when the first u s ship landed in guangzhou with a cargo of american grown ginseng and silver to trade for tea if theres a pattern to the relationship , it has been rapturous enchantment followed by despair right now , americans are in the disenchantment phase of the cycle , as are the chinese you tell many colorful anecdotes of americans and chinese in contact with each other which one do you think best reflects the wider story \? one of the main goals of the book was to bring to light stories of unchronicled influence on both sides the first american minister to the qing court in beijing was a young republican named anson burlingame burlingame was a radical abolitionist who was dispatched to beijing by the lincoln administration burlingame believed that the west needed to give china time to develop and modernize and stop pressuring china to change he believed that the west had no right to criticize , for example , the way china treated chinese christians , and he argued that western officials should tolerate the chinese habit of maintaining that their emperor actually ruled the entire world to me , burlingame encapsulates one side of the american view of china , one that reappeared in the 1970s and lasted up through the beginning of the obama administration the idea , or rather the bet that china would liberalize and become more like us as long as we facilitated its rise in opposition to burlingame , other americans believed his views on china were , as one of his successors in beijing put it , a hallucination that also has formed a key part of the american perspective on china your book discusses the way governments in the two nations have interacted with each other , but you also go into detail on the roles that notable nonpolitical figures have played to what extent does the united states china relationship depend on the attitudes of each countries leaders versus those of other citizens , whether they are from the elite classes or the grass roots \? in many ways , we and the chinese , and our governments , elites and those from the grass roots , are captives of our past in the beginning of the relationship , individual americans and chinese created the relationship and imbued it with much of its meaning american merchants and missionaries saw china as a vast market for stuff and for souls chinese saw america as a place that could save china from the depredations of other imperialist nations and , with its world class educational system , as a model for china to emulate at the same time , other groups of americans feared the chinese and , starting in the late 1870s , oppressed chinese workers in america , starting a long history of fearing the industriousness of the chinese chinese had their own prejudices against americans and american ideas as well , viewing them as immoral , sexually deviant and dangerous many of these dreams and nightmares , fantasies and biases we have about each other have resurfaced in subsequent decades in donald trumps claim that china has been raping the united states when it comes to trade , one can hear the populists of the california workingmens party in late 19th century california railing on the streets of san francisco against the heathen chinese in your many years as a journalist in china , what were the most notable changes you saw in the united states china relationship \? with chinas rise , beijing is less willing to bend to washingtons will than before and more willing to aggressively pursue its interests , whether they involve trade or the south china sea washington spent decades arguing that as china strengthened it would become more like a liberal western nation it hasnt turned out that way , and as such the u s has stopped doing china any favors much more than before , it is blocking the sales of western companies to chinese firms and strengthening its alliances with nations around chinas periphery the careful balance of containment and engagement that defined americas policy toward china is now heavily skewed toward containment what are your thoughts on president xi jinpings worldview and how the united states fits into that \? xi jinping has said he wants asians to rule asia , which i think can be translated into a desire to see china rule asia in this view , the u s is an interloper and would do best to retreat to hawaii and let china handle the western pacific china benefited greatly from the pax americana in the pacific , but now xi feels that china does not need the

president elect donald j trump promised to undo many of the obama administrations most ambitious regulations but even before he takes office , federal courts in texas are doing some of the work for him a federal judges injunction this week halted a labor department rule that would have made millions more americans eligible for overtime pay over the last two years , federal district court judges in the state have chipped away at mr obamas legacy by striking down or suspending no fewer than five regulations , executive orders or actions , and guidelines , including an action that would have allowed illegal immigrants who are parents of united states citizens to remain in the country , and guidance that would have expanded restroom access for transgender students the injunction in the overtime case , issued on tuesday by a judge nominated by mr obama , has many advocates and legal experts concerned its a troubling trend because its essentially delegating policy oversight to a set of handpicked judges in the south , who can pick and choose which regulations move forward and which do not , said matthew wessler , a principal at the firm gupta wessler who has argued multiple cases involving workers before the supreme court the case over the overtime rule , which would have made an estimated 4 2 million people newly eligible for time and a half overtime pay , provides some insight into why opponents of regulation conclude that descending on texas increases their odds of success in an interview , the nevada attorney general , adam paul laxalt , whose state was the lead plaintiff in the case against the overtime rule , said that the coalition of states it led had elected to file in the eastern district of texas because the district had a reputation for handing down rulings quickly that was what is known as a fast docket , mr laxalt said the decision was made based on a bunch of variables , but we thought we may be able to get the quickest answer citing the dec 1 effective date for the new regulation , he said , we were really fighting the clock mr laxalt added that nevada had been part of multistate litigation that was filed in other states , including a case over a rule regulating waterways , which was filed in north dakota texas has a rich culture of antigovernment litigation in 2013 , greg abbott , now the states governor and then its attorney general , jokingly described a typical workday as , i go into the office , i sue the federal government and i go home he bragged that he had sued the obama administration 25 times in the previous four years while federal judges in texas are officially appointed by the president , not state officials , senate custom gives the states two united states senators considerable influence over the nominations the judges that do manage to get nominated have to somehow pass through the gauntlet of ted cruz and john cornyn , said richard levy , the secretary treasurer of the state a f l c i o who served as its legal director for more than 20 years it has skewed the bench here in a way i dont think is probably likely in other places even though the federal judge who ruled on the overtime regulation , amos l mazzant iii , was formally nominated by mr obama in 2014 , the influence of mr cruz and mr cornyn made it unlikely that he would be overly sympathetic to federal regulations , mr levy said still , the sweep of judge mazzants decision appears to have surprised even skeptics of the regulation the obama regulation raised the annual salary limit below which workers are automatically eligible for overtime pay something that previous administrations , including george w bushs , had done several times since 1938 to 47 , 476 , from 23 , 660 in his ruling , however , judge mazzant suggested not simply that the administration lacked the authority to raise the salary limit so high , but that no administration had the authority to establish and raise a salary limit of any kind nothing in the law , he wrote , indicates that congress intended the department to define and delimit with respect to a minimum salary level \( judge mazzant retreated from the implications of this statement in a footnote asserting that he was determining the legality only of the obama regulation \) asked if he agreed with the judge that the labor department lacked the authority to create a salary limit of any kind , not just the new level developed by the administration , mr laxalt , the nevada attorney general , said , we do think the judge got it right when he said its unclear whether or not they can do an arbitrary salary test , but confessed that he wouldnt necessarily follow the ruling to its logical conclusion im not prepared to say categorically were opposed to the 23 , 000 , the limit established by george w bush , he said for his part , thomas e perez , the labor secretary , argued in an interview that it simply was not possible to single out the obama salary limit as extreme or arbitrary while accepting the previous increases , since the new limit was in line with some of them if we had simply indexed the 1975 threshold to inflation , that number would be well in

donald trump schlepped across town on tuesday to meet with the publisher of the new york times and some editors , columnists and reporters at the paper as the times reported , trump actually seemed to soften some of his positions he seemed to indicate that he wouldnt seek to prosecute hillary clinton but he should never have said that he was going to do that in the first place he seemed to indicate that he wouldnt encourage the military to use torture but he should never have said that he would do that in the first place he said that he would have an open mind on climate change but that should always have been his position you dont get a pat on the back for ratcheting down from rabid after exploiting that very radicalism to your advantage unrepentant opportunism belies a staggering lack of character and caring that cant simply be vanquished from memory you did real harm to this country and many of its citizens , and i will never never forget that as i read the transcript and then listened to the audio , the slime factor was overwhelming after a campaign of bashing the times relentlessly , in the face of the actual journalists , he tempered his whining with flattery at one point he said i just appreciate the meeting and i have great respect for the new york times tremendous respect its very special always has been very special he ended the meeting by saying i will say , the times is , its a great , great american jewel a world jewel and i hope we can all get along well i will say proudly and happily that i was not present at this meeting the very idea of sitting across the table from a demagogue who preyed on racial , ethnic and religious hostilities and treating him with decorum and social grace fills me with disgust , to the point of overflowing let me tell you here where i stand on your i hope we can all get along plea never you are an aberration and abomination who is willing to do and say anything no matter whom it aligns you with and whom it hurts to satisfy your ambitions i dont believe you care much at all about this country or your party or the american people i believe that the only thing you care about is self aggrandizement and self enrichment your strongest allegiance is to your own cupidity i also believe that much of your campaign was an act of psychological projection , as we are now learning that many of the things you slammed clinton for are things of which you may actually be guilty you slammed clinton for destroying emails , then newsweek reported last month that your companies destroyed emails in defiance of court orders you slammed clinton and the clinton foundation for paid speeches and conflicts of interest , then it turned out that , as buzzfeed reported , the trump foundation received a 150 , 000 donation in exchange for your giving a 2015 speech made by video to a conference in ukraine you slammed clinton about conflicts of interest while she was secretary of state , and now your possible conflicts of interest are popping up like mushrooms in a marsh you are a fraud and a charlatan yes , you will be president , but you will not get any breaks just because one branch of your forked tongue is silver i am not easily duped by dopes i have not only an ethical and professional duty to call out how obscene your very existence is at the top of american government i have a moral obligation to do so im not trying to convince anyone of anything , but rather to speak up for truth and honor and inclusion this isnt just about you , but also about the moral compass of those who see you for who and what you are , and know the darkness you herald is only held at bay by the lights of truth its not that i dont believe that people can change and grow they can but real growth comes from the accepting of responsibility and repenting of culpability expedient reversal isnt growth its gross so let me say this on thanksgiving im thankful to have this platform because as long as there are ink and pixels , you will be the focus of my withering gaze im thankful that i have the endurance and can assume a posture that will never allow what you represent to ever be seen as everyday and ordinary no , mr trump , we will not all just get along for as long as a threat to the state is the head of state , all citizens of good faith and national fidelity and certainly this columnist have an absolute obligation to meet you and your agenda with resistance at every turn i know this in my bones , and for that i am thankful

at thanksgiving , many of us will be subject to or subjecting our hosts to a wide range of opinions about the 2016 election but some aspects of it are rooted in fact not open to interpretation \( sorry , uncle bill \) below , we present a compendium of sorts about the election , to help guide you in your discussions some of these may seem basic , but they are by no means obvious to everyone dont let them get in the way of a good holiday argument hillary clinton definitely won the popular vote , and that lead is only going to grow the new york times called the election for donald j trump at about 2 40 a m on nov 9 at that time , he had about 57 2 million votes , almost a million more than hillary clinton even before then , the signs pointed to her edge in the national popular vote most of the votes that remain uncounted are in heavily democratic places like california even roughly two weeks later , the state estimated that it had about two million ballots yet to be counted , including about 760 , 000 in los angeles county , where voters have preferred mrs clinton by around 50 percentage points as the votes have trickled in , the popular vote has tilted toward mrs clinton as of wednesday morning , that lead surpassed two million votes , or 1 5 percentage points better than mr trump \( our time stamped estimates are courtesy of dave wassermans excellent popular vote tracker \) this lead is still growing , but its already a larger margin than in popular vote victories by al gore in 2000 , richard nixon in 1968 and john f kennedy in 1960 turnout in the 2016 election was not low it is about the same as it was in 2012 and comparable to most 20th century presidential elections turnout is simple to calculate take the total number of votes cast and divide it by the total number of adults who are eligible to vote , and presto , you have a turnout rate ! when the race was called , this math problem yielded a rate that was , indeed , historically low it was also wrong , for the same reason mrs clinton trailed in the popular vote at that time not all the ballots had been counted because the denominator in this math problem the number of voting eligible adults on election day does not change , the turnout rate goes up every time ballots are counted as they have come in , the turnout rate has risen to about 57 7 percent michael mcdonald at the united states elections project estimates that it will ultimately be closer to 58 4 percent , a bit lower than it was in 2012 and roughly comparable to most presidential elections in the last 100 years yes , the polls were off , but not in extraordinary ways mrs clinton held a modest but steady lead in nearly every national poll for months , and led most state polls in florida , north carolina , pennsylvania , michigan and wisconsin yet she lost in each of these states so how wrong were the polls \? on average , by about 3 4 percentage points in the closest states thats higher than in any election in decades , but comparable to polling misses in 1988 and 1992 the 2016 polling miss feels much larger because the places where mrs clinton fared worse than polls suggested were concentrated in a few battleground states the places where she fared better than expected were in big liberal states , where she had almost no chance of losing nationally , these effects nearly canceled out , which is why her national polling lead before the election three to four points ended up being close to the result \( which , again , is about a 1 5 point lead and is expected to grow as more votes come in \) third party candidates , like gary johnson and jill stein , may have cost mrs clinton michigan , but they almost certainly did not cost her the presidency the total vote tally says about 4 percent of all voters , about 5 8 million people , voted for mr johnson \( 3 3 percent \) or ms stein \( 1 percent \) in four battleground states that mrs clinton lost florida , pennsylvania , wisconsin and michigan the votes for these third party candidates exceeded mr trumps margin of victory if those states had flipped , mrs clinton would be president are third party voters responsible for the trump presidency \? almost certainly not with the exception of michigan , third party voters would have had to overwhelmingly favor mrs clinton to flip the state that notion also rests on a significant number of third party voters coming to the polls , but many of them told pollsters that they would have stayed home if they could not have voted for their third party candidate if we look at mr trumps margin of victory in these four states and the number of votes cast for mr johnson or ms stein , were left with a simple math problem if those candidates did not exist , what share of those votes would mrs clinton have needed to pick up to overtake mr trumps vote lead \? the answer a substantial share might these voters really have preferred mrs clinton to mr trump to this degree and showed up to the polls at higher rates than they told pollsters they would \? its possible but for that vote to be decisive , pennsylvania or florida and at least one other state would have had to flip the evidence we have suggests such an outcome would have been highly unlikely if anything , the johnson vote could have easily leaned toward
donald j trump has said climate change is a hoax created by the chinese to get the united states to suppress its manufacturing sector that prompted a public rebuttal last week from a chinese official attending a climate summit meeting in marrakesh , morocco on tuesday , mr trump appeared to back away from the strict climate denier viewpoint embraced by many republicans in an interview with the new york times , saying that there was some connectivity between human activity and climate change he also said he wanted to keep an open mind about whether to pull the united states out of the paris agreement , the main global climate change accord mr trumps opacity means it is unclear whether he will actually support policies to limit the effects of climate change after being sworn in as president in january but officials from china , which has surpassed the united states as the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gas , have said they will move forward on climate policies without the americans , if it comes to that on tuesday , michael r bloomberg , the media tycoon and former mayor of new york city , said that american cities would continue to enact climate policies no matter what mr trump and the federal government decided to do mr bloomberg made his remarks in washington at a talk hosted by the china general chamber of commerce they were adapted for an op ed article published tuesday by bloomberg view under the headline , washington wont have last word on climate change mr bloomberg , a longtime advocate for action on climate change , praised xie zhenhua , chinas climate envoy , for saying china remained committed to tackling the issue thats a responsible thing to do for the chinese people and the world , he said mr bloomberg added that if mr trump decided to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement , then he would urge the mayors of 128 cities in the united states who see the need to fight climate change to join the agreement following is a central passage from mr bloombergs op ed article i cant tell you what donald trumps administration will do and in all fairness , they will need time to figure it out themselves whats said on the campaign trail is one thing actually carrying out a specific policy is another i hope theyll recognize the importance of the issue but i am confident that no matter what happens in washington , no matter what regulations the next administration adopts or rescinds , no matter what laws the next congress may pass , we will meet the pledges that the u s made in paris the reason is simple cities , businesses and citizens will continue reducing emissions , because they have concluded just as china has that doing so is in their own self interest the u s s success in fighting climate change has never been primarily dependent on washington bear in mind over the past decade , congress has not passed a single bill that takes direct aim at climate change yet at the same time , the u s has led the world in reducing emissions that progress has been driven by cities , businesses and citizens and none of them are letting up now just the opposite all are looking for ways to expand their efforts mayors and local leaders around the country are determined to keep pushing ahead on climate change mr bloombergs remarks dovetail with recent ones made by american mayors who say their cities will defy potential policies from mr trump on critical issues among others , the mayors of new york , chicago , seattle , philadelphia and washington have said their cities will be immigrant sanctuaries that do not cooperate with united states immigration and customs enforcement in his visit with reporters and editors at the new york times on tuesday , mr trump said of the paris agreement im looking at it very closely i have an open mind to it in addressing the climate issue , he also said , clean air is vitally important mr trump appeared to be confusing the issues of climate change and air pollution carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that accelerate climate change do not cause smog it is buildup of particulate matter that leads to toxic air , a severe problem in chinese cities greenhouses gases and particulate matter can both come from the same source in many cases , industrial coal burning so any policies to limit the use of coal helps with both issues the united states and china have made pledges to curb the use of coal mr bloomberg concluded the op ed article published tuesday with this thought washington will not have the last word on the fate of the paris agreement in the u s mayors will , together with business leaders and citizens
salinas , calif as americans gather around thanksgiving tables , chances are that the healthier parts of their menus the tossed salads , broccoli casseroles or steaming bowls of roasted brussels sprouts were grown here in the salinas valley a long strip of deep and fertile soil pinched by sharply rising mountains , the valley has more than doubled its output of produce in recent decades and now grows well over half of americas leaf lettuce yet one place the valleys bounty of antioxidants does not often appear is on the tables of the migrant workers who harvest it public health officials here describe a crisis of poverty and malnutrition among the tens of thousands of farmworkers and their families who tend to the fields of lettuce , broccoli , celery , cauliflower and spinach , among many other crops , in an area called the salad bowl of the nation more than a third of the children in the salinas city elementary school district are homeless overall diabetes rates are rising and projected to soar and 85 percent of farmworkers in the valley are overweight or obese , partly because unhealthy food is less costly , said marc b schenker , a professor at the university of california , davis , who studies the health of farmworkers the people who grow our food cant afford to eat it , and they are sicker because of it , said joel diringer , a public health specialist and advocate for farmworkers its an incredible irony that those who work in the fields all day long dont have access to the fresh produce that they harvest for decades , the fields of the salinas valley have been a revolving door of migrants , from the okies of john steinbecks writings to the latin american immigrants who tend the fields today ninety one percent of farmworkers in california are foreign born , primarily from mexico , according to the united states department of labor while the valleys vegetables are reaching an ever growing number of american households , public health officials say there are no signs of improvement in the living conditions and diets of farmworkers the popularity of sugary drinks and cultural preferences for filling but high calorie foods like tacos and tamales contribute to the obesity of farmworkers and their families , public health officials say because an estimated half of agricultural workers in the salinas valley are in the country illegally , many do not have health insurance and go without treatment until symptoms become acute the combination of high rents and low incomes wages typically fall in the range of 10 to 15 an hour leaves farmworkers with minimal and often inadequate money for food and is a contributor to the housing crisis in salinas homelessness has risen so steadily in recent years that the salinas city elementary school district now has a liaison for students without permanent housing cheryl camany , the school districts homeless liaison , listed the types of dwellings where some farmworkers slept tents , encampments , abandoned buildings , she said they could be living in a toolshed , a chicken coop poverty and neglect among farmworkers is by no means new steinbeck , the valleys most famous native son , wrote in the 1930s about the curious attitude toward a group that makes our agriculture successful the migrants are needed , and they are hated , he wrote , a sentiment that residents here feel has been revived with the election of donald j trump as president and his promises to deport undocumented workers at a diabetes and nutrition awareness class held at a nursery school in king city , overweight women from farmworker families were given a barrage of statistics on the dangers of poor diets , especially those excessive in sugar two in five americans will develop diabetes , lisa rico , the instructor , told the class in spanish but for us its one in two the class was run by the natividad medical foundation , a nonprofit that is part of natividad medical center , a large hospital in salinas ms rico read to the class the findings of a survey of 1 , 200 young people in monterey county , which includes salinas 72 percent of children under 10 years old and 83 percent of teenagers said they drank at least one soda a day adolescents drank 4 5 times as many sugary drinks as water a study published in march by the u c l a center for health policy research reported that 57 percent of residents in monterey county had diabetes or prediabetes , just slightly above the california average of 55 percent but dr dana kent , the medical director for health promotion and education at the natividad medical foundation , said estimates among farmworkers might be low , especially among those who are undocumented and fearful to obtain medical services we get a sense that there are a lot of people out there who are undiagnosed , dr kent said on a recent afternoon , workers from mexico and el salvador harvested heads of iceberg lettuce in a field in gonzales , a city in the heart of the salinas valley the workers moved so quickly slicing , trimming the outer leaves and putting the heads of lettuce into plastic bags that they looked like actors in a film played at an accelerated speed angelica beltran , the supervisor , said her workers typically ate six to eight tacos while at work and had two or three sodas during their shift no one drinks diet soda , she said it doesnt taste good despite the frenetic pace of the work , farmworkers suffer from what melissa kendrick , the head of the food bank for monterey county , calls the obesity paradox of the poor they are fat , yes , but they are malnourished because all they are eating is garbage , she
this interview with john lilly , a partner at greylock partners , a silicon valley venture capital firm , was conducted and condensed by adam bryant q what were your early years like \? were you in leadership roles early on \? a my dad was in the air force , and we moved around a lot there was a stretch when i went to a different school every year we lived in san antonio before i went to college i learned a lot from being in a marching band i was playing trumpet , and it was a 200 piece marching band , exactly like in friday night lights i became a section leader , and we would get up at 6 30 in the morning and do all our drills when it was still dark then i went to stanford , where i had a lot of great leadership opportunities as a sophomore , i ran the kitchen for our dormitory another guy and i had a budget of about 300 , 000 a year and we were responsible for feeding 80 people and hiring staff when you were younger , did you mind moving so often \? i dont remember kicking or screaming i always just thought it was a pretty good adventure im pretty adaptable im good at packing and unpacking tell me more about your parents they both have a good sense of humor and like jokes , and humors a big part of what i value and how i lead and theyre both analytical moms an accountant dad was a physics major but then became an engineer i remember when i was in second grade , we needed a new tv all my friends would just go to the store and buy one , but my dad bought a heathkit , and we had to put together the parts i remember being mortified and saying , dad , why cant we go buy a tv like everybody else \? but in retrospect , it taught me that everything is made by people we look at our technology now , like iphones , and i think a lot of people see them as magical obelisks from the mountains that steve jobs bestows on us early leadership lessons for you \? i didnt understand the role of simplicity and messaging early on one of the things that happened at one of my start ups was that i would get bored saying the same thing every day so i decided to change it up a little bit but then everybody had a different idea of what i thought because i was mixing it up so my big lesson was the importance of a simple message , and saying it the same way over and over if youre going to change it , change it in a big way , and make sure everyone knows its a change otherwise keep it static you spend a lot of your time meeting with c e o s to decide whether to invest in their companies how do you assess them \? one is sort of a context free assessment , which is , who is this person and how do they behave \? the other is a contextual assessment , which is , am i any good for this person \? there are some amazing c e o s who i just dont know how to interact with because of stylistic differences you have to have both because you want to make good investments , but you also want to make good investments where you can work with the person i ask a lot of questions , but i almost dont care what the questions are when people start talking about their business plan , ill say , what about this , what about this , what about this \? you start to expand the scope of the questions to try to see two things one is the quality of their thought process and the other is how they interact with you do they become defensive \? do they become aggressive \? are they listening \? youre trying to get a sense of whether , in a complicated situation with a lot of things going on , can they be honest and candid and still get to a productive place sometimes you get honest and candid , and sometimes you get antagonistic or defensive as a v c , ill meet with probably 400 companies a year and ill invest in two of them the context of those meetings is highly variable , and the power dynamics are all bizarre because you come into this 60 minute crucible moment you have to go out of your way to make sure that your questioning is understood when i was a v c at first , i would just ask my questions and kind of poke , poke , poke , poke and now ill say look , im going to ask some things , and this might be kind of awkward , but im just going to say it , and lets work our way through it and it doesnt mean i dont believe in you and your company i just want to understand where you are and what you think im going to ask some things and they might be wrong , but lets figure some things out together the one thing thats profoundly different about being a v c compared to an operator is that v c s talk a lot about fomo fear of missing out you turn things down all the time , and you worry , what did i miss and what did i get wrong \? as an operator , you focus 100 percent on what youre doing as a v c , you wonder what youre not doing its a difference in perspective what career and life advice do you give to new college

president elect donald j trump has reached into western michigan royalty to pick betsy devos as his education secretary and is looking at ben carson to head the department of housing and urban development meantime , hillary clinton has widened her lead in the popular vote to 1 5 percentage points , a spread not seen for a losing candidate since the disputed election of 1876 mr trumps choice of betsy devos to be his education secretary brings western michigan royalty into the trump fold , but she was not always a fan mrs devos sharply criticized mr trump during the campaign , and spent much of the year raising money for other republicans on the ballot until we have a better reason to embrace and support the top of the ticket , and see an agenda that is truly an opportunity agenda , then we have lots of other options in which to invest and spend our time helping , she said in may the devos family , heirs to the amway fortune , has long been a leading source of money for republicans in michigan and beyond just in the last three elections before 2016 , members of the family gave nearly 9 5 million to party committees and candidates mrs devos had money of her own before she married richard devos jr , the amway scion her father , edgar prince , built his own auto parts supplier , in holland , mich her brother , erik prince , founded blackwater usa , a private security contractor whose guards were convicted of killing 14 civilians in baghdad in 2007 the national education association , the nations largest teachers union , was quick to voice its opposition to ms devos with nominees chosen for c i a , national security adviser , secretary of education and ambassador to the united nations , the next pick is expected to be the retired neurosurgeon ben carson to head the department of housing and urban development that could be official as early as friday mr trump posted on twitter that he was seriously considering mr carson , a former rival in the republican primaries , as housing secretary the department is no small corner of the government its programs fund public housing , subsidize rent for the poor , promote homeownership and work to revitalize struggling cities and housing policy has been in a deep freeze since the great recession , when the nominally independent mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac collapsed and fell under federal control for nearly a decade , the mortgage industry has basically been government run , with much of its profits going right into the treasury mr carson would have a big role in figuring out how to move forward writing in the conservative washington times last year , mr carson let it be known that he is no fan of government intervention in the housing market , specifically to force racial integration with new votes tallied from new jersey , illinois , maryland and california , mrs clintons popular vote lead reached 2 , 017 , 563 overnight , prompting new calls for an audit of voting machines in battleground states mrs clintons lead now exceeds the winning percentages of seven presidents , five of whom also won the electoral college and it has given rise to a push from liberal activists to demand audits in three states won narrowly by mr trump michigan , wisconsin and pennsylvania the university of michigan computer scientist j alex halderman posted an extensive explanation on wednesday nate cohn , who wrote of voter projections and analyzed polls for the new york times , isnt buying it mainly , it would seem , mrs clintons record losing lead is pointing toward a structural disadvantage democrats have with the electoral college their voters are too concentrated in the bright blue states of the west coast and northeast democrats have now won the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections , but lost two of them \( al gore in 2000 , and mrs clinton \) in the electoral college after the hoo ha created when ivanka trump fine jewelry started hawking a bracelet worn by ms trump during a 60 minutes appearance as part of the new first family , ivanka trump the brand and ivanka trump the woman are beginning to disengage at least on instagram , facebook and elsewhere on monday , a public letter from ivanka trump hq noted \( in part \) the separation follows another public letter from the designer sophie theallet announcing that she would refrain from dressing melania trump and encouraging her fellow designers to do the same one more such open missive and we will have a new fashion trend when anthony scaramucci , the hedge fund titan and trump adviser , floated elton john as an inauguration performer to the new york post , the singers response was swift no way he did , after all , say in october , we need a humanitarian in the white house , not a barbarian pity mr scaramucci was counting on the diversity statement , telling the post president elect trump has chosen gov nikki haley of south carolina , the daughter of indian immigrants , to be his ambassador to the united nations , the transition team announced wednesday mr trump , whose presidential run was buoyed by an uncompromising stance against immigration , has mostly chosen older white men for cabinet posts in assembling his new team her move would eventually elevate south carolinas lieutenant governor , henry mcmaster , an early and vocal supporter of mr trumps ms haley backed senator marco rubio of florida during the primaries mr trump arrived on tuesday night in florida to celebrate thanksgiving at his private club , mar a lago , in palm beach , a visit intended to give the president elect some time with his family ,
in a saner time , in a country whose politics were less poisoned , there would be no talk of punishing young immigrants like sofia de la vega , luis roberto ursua briceno and anayancy ramos no one would be threatening to derail their ambitions , stifle their educations , throttle their dreams but this is the country we live in , with a president elect who may be preparing to do that , and perhaps worse when donald trump takes office in january , he will have the power to upend the lives of more than 700 , 000 young people who have grown up in the united states after being brought here illegally as children and he has said many times that this is exactly what he will do known as dreamers , these young people were given temporary protection from deportation and permission to work by president obama they are the beneficiaries of a program called deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca , the one sweeping immigration reform that mr obama achieved in eight otherwise frustrating years should mr trump decide to send a deportation force after them , they could end up being expelled from the only country they know it would be a relatively simple task the department of homeland security already has their names , addresses and other personal information and their written acknowledgment that they are living in the country without permission daca was never a form of legalization , which only congress can grant it was not an executive order it was a decision by homeland security , at mr obamas direction , to make dangerous criminals and security threats the main priority and to grant this group of young immigrants who are culturally americans , citizens in all but the paperwork a reprieve from deportation , renewable after two years this program is entirely revocable , and revoking it immediately is what mr trump has promised the result would be potentially devastating to over 700 , 000 individual lives , not to mention the larger economy one inescapable fact of living outside the law is the heavy ceiling that it places on a young persons ambition without daca , these young people would graduate from high school and have almost no way to pursue more education or careers their potential is vast , but their paths would become narrow living largely in the shadows , they are part of a tragic cohort quiet casualties of americas great failure to achieve immigration reform the times has asked dreamers to send in their stories and videos they include mr ursua briceno , who is studying biochemistry at arizona state university ms ramos , a biochemistry and biology major at eastern connecticut state university and ms de la vega , from florida when i first heard president obamas speech on daca years ago , i saw the light at the end of the tunnel , ms de la vega wrote daca granted me everything to live a normal life and , for once , belong it was temporary , but it felt real she is pursing an associates degree to become a paramedic i have a brother that drowned when i was younger in my home country , you can forget that police and ambulance will arrive or even bother to come if you call my only hope is to save as many lives as i can , and to die risking my life for another the decision to expand the opportunities of ms de la vega and the others should be obvious there are 11 million immigrants living here outside the law , a vast majority of them strivers , like these dreamers congress has tried for years to fix the outdated laws that block their paths to legal status , but bipartisan bills have been killed time and again in congress by mostly republican opposition lacking real immigration reform , daca is one way to honor a vision of the country , and of the positive contributions of immigrants , that has been badly degraded in this grotesque election year the program should be continued , as a down payment on the american future ending it would be a dreadfully shortsighted , self harming way to start a presidency
following is a transcript of president elect donald j trumps interview on tuesday with reporters , editors and opinion columnists from the new york times the transcription was prepared by liam stack , jonah engel bromwich , karen workman and tim herrera of the times more on the trump transition here arthur sulzberger jr , publisher of the new york times thank you very much for joining us and i want to reaffirm this is on the record donald j trump , president elect of the united states o k sulzberger all right , so were clear we had a very nice meeting in the churchill room youre a churchill fan , i hear \? trump i am , i am sulzberger theres a photo of the great man behind you trump there was a big thing about the bust that was removed out of the oval office sulzberger i heard youre thinking of putting it back trump i am , indeed i am sulzberger wonderful so weve got a good collection here from our newsroom and editorial and our columnists i just want to say we had a good , quiet , but useful and well meaning conversation in there so i appreciate that very much trump i appreciate it , too sulzberger i thought maybe id start this off by asking if you have anything you would like to start this off with before we move to the easiest questions youre going to get this administration laughter trump o k well , i just appreciate the meeting and i have great respect for the new york times tremendous respect its very special always has been very special i think ive been treated very rough its well out there that ive been treated extremely unfairly in a sense , in a true sense i wouldnt only complain about the times i would say the times was about the roughest of all you could make the case the washington post was bad , but every once in a while id actually get a good article not often , dean , but every once in awhile look , i have great respect for the times , and id like to turn it around i think it would make the job i am doing much easier were working very hard we have great people coming in i think youll be very impressed with the names well be announcing some very shortly everybody wanted to do this people are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks but theyre giving up a lot i mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is but i think were going to see some tremendous talent , tremendous talent coming in we have many people for every job i mean no matter what the job is , we have many incredible people i think , reince , you can sort of just confirm that the quality of the people is very good reince priebus , mr trumps choice for chief of staff inaudible trump were trying very hard to get the best people not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct people , because that hasnt been working so we have really experts in the field some are known and some are not known , but theyre known within their field as being the best thats very important to me you know , ive been given a great honor its been very tough its been 18 months of brutality in a true sense , but we won it we won it pretty big the final numbers are coming out or i guess theyre coming out michigans just being confirmed but the numbers are coming out far beyond what anybodys wildest expectation was i dont know if it was us , i mean , we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind of , everything , the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people as you probably know , i did many , many speeches that last four week period i was just telling arthur that i went around and did speeches in the pretty much 11 different places , that were , the massive crowds we were getting if we had a stadium that held and most of you , many of you were there that held 20 , 000 people , wed have 15 , 000 people outside that couldnt get in so we came up with a good system we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left i would do , during the last month , two or three a day thats a lot because thats not easy when you have big crowds those speeches , thats not an easy way of life , doing three a day then i said the last two days , i want to do six and seven and im not sure anybody has ever done that but we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 oclock in the morning in michigan and we had 31 , 000 people , 17 , 000 or 18 , 000 inside and the rest outside this massive place in grand rapids , i guess and it was an incredible thing and i left saying how do we lose michigan \? i dont think we can lose michigan and the reason i did that , it was set up only a little while before because we heard that day that hillary was hearing that theyre going to lose michigan , which hasnt been lost in 38 years or something but 38 years and they didnt want to lose michigan so they went out along with president obama and michelle , bill and hillary , they went
politicians lie donald trump dissembles more frequently than most so no matter how clever or tough or eloquent your questions , there are limits to what an hour or so in a room with him can actually establish but this newspapers lunch with the next president of the united states was still , i think , a possibly revelatory experience given the palpable tension between the president elect and my employer \( or failing nytimes , as his twitter self would have it \) , it was interesting to observe the ways in which trump did and didnt try to ease that tension , the places where he was conciliatory and the places where he dug in his heels and refused to give an inch the conciliation was most striking on public policy without getting into details , trump professed to have an open mind about climate change , made a passing reference to making an immigration deal that we \( meaning my more liberal on immigration than myself colleagues \) would find surprisingly congenial , and was more eager , as usual , to talk about repairing roads and persuading apple to build products stateside than about fiscal discipline or any other more paul ryan ish republican priority he also professed to have an open mind on torture , an issue where his campaign rhetoric was particularly reckless he had been impressed , he said , when james mattis , a former marine corps general and a leading candidate to be secretary of defense , dismissed waterboarding as less effective than the art of subtler persuasion \( a possible lesson if you want president trump to cool off , make sure its the guy nicknamed mad dog urging restraint \) he hewed to his campaign trail promise to aim for dtente with russia , but he also revived a past promise to try to solve the israeli palestinian conflict he was personally conciliatory toward hillary clinton \( more so than toward republicans who had crossed him \) , positively glowing in his descriptions of president obama , and amply complimentary toward this newspapers storied past and he was quick enough to disavow his white supremacist supporters , albeit in a way that took no responsibility for the ways that both he and his strategist , steve bannon , had played footsie with birthers and online alt right trolls so the overall policy impression trump left was that he would be very happy to play a nixon rockefeller republican , with lots of public works spending , pump priming economic policy and attempted deal making overseas if this posture was a pander to my colleagues pro government sensibilities , it was also a plausible one consistent with trumps new york background , his past \( and in his heart , probably present \) social liberalism and many of his pre 2016 pronouncements it may not be possible for trump to govern this way , given the republican party as it exists , his erratic temperament and tendency to be more george wallace like than nixonian on race , crime and immigration but i can well believe that its how he sees himself whats also consistent with trumps background , though , is an unapologetic eye for the main chance and a brazen disregard for propriety and self restraint and this was where his lack of pandering to timesian sensibilities was striking he refused to yield much ground when faced with questions about the ethics of being a businessman president whose beloved family plays both sides of the trump organization trump administration line amid prodding by my colleagues on these issues , he made only the vaguest of promises about firewalling himself off from his companies and investments , while constantly stressing that no clear conflict of interest laws govern the presidency , playing down the appearance of corruption as inconsequential and basically suggesting that he intends to continue the kind of seemingly self dealing moments \( photo ops with business partners , self interested comments to foreign politicians \) that have already cropped up during his transition there will be no blind trust he wont sell off anything , because real estate is too hard to unload hes still signing checks \( though he would eventually phase that out \) hed love to have his son in law working for him \( maybe solving the israel palestine problem ! \) even though nepotism laws might make it hard his kids would run the business and he could hardly be asked not to have contact with ivanka , could he \? we didnt need to worry , he promised , because he didnt care about his business any more , only about america though of course he was aware that the trump hotel in washington might see more business , and that his brand was probably doing well worldwide whether or not you believe a politician when he panders , its wise to believe him when he doesnt so our hour with donald trump left me persuaded that whether he governs effectively or incompetently , as a moderate or a conservative or something in between , his administration will be closer to a kings court than any presidency before it and it will be very , very good to be the king
washington struggling to respond to donald j trumps victory , a group of shellshocked democrats moved swiftly to endorse representative keith ellison of minnesota for chairman of the democratic national committee , hoping that he would be a fresh face for a party with a depleted bench but after steadily adding endorsements from leading democrats in his bid to take over the party , mr ellison is encountering resistance from a formidable corner the white house in a sign of the discord gripping the party , president obamas loyalists , uneasy with the progressive mr ellison , have begun casting about for an alternative , according to multiple democratic officials close to the president the battle pits the titans of the democratic party against one another , with mr obamas camp at odds with figures like chuck schumer , the new senate democratic leader , and senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts mr obamas advisers , some of whom discussed the party leadership race at a white house meeting last week , have talked about whether labor secretary thomas e perez and former gov jennifer granholm of michigan would be willing to run for the post mr perez met with vice president joseph r biden jr last week and had lunch tuesday in the white house mess with valerie jarrett , mr obamas senior adviser , while also visiting with david simas , mr obamas political director some in mr obamas circle were even holding out hope that mr biden himself could be persuaded to step into the chairmanship as a unifying force for a party reeling after losing the presidency and making scant gains in the house and senate but mr bidens office said tuesday that he was not interested in being d n c chair , though he plans to remain deeply involved in helping shape the direction of the democratic party moving forward the tumultuous tenure of representative debbie wasserman schultz , who was forced out as party leader in july , convinced a wide range of democrats that whoever takes over the committee must make it their sole focus theres too much at stake for us not to have somebody working in a full time capacity , said michael blake , a new york assemblyman and veteran of both of mr obamas campaigns , who is considering a d n c vice chairmanship this has to be your priority but there are other reasons for the discomfort with mr ellison that illustrate lingering divisions after a bruising presidential primary fight and a general election in which hillary clinton suffered deep losses among working class whites and could not match mr obamas support among young and nonwhite voters some democrats , in mr obamas orbit and beyond , say that elevating mr ellison would amount to handing the party to senator bernie sanders of vermont , mrs clintons primary race opponent , and his liberal followers mr ellison was a high profile backer of mr sanderss presidential campaign , and mr sanders has been rallying support for mr ellisons d n c bid already a polarizing figure among democrats , he ignited new controversy this week by saying the party needed to go beyond identity politics its not good enough for someone to say im a woman ! vote for me ! mr sanders told students in boston on sunday , a comment widely seen as a criticism of mrs clinton no , thats not good enough what we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to wall street , to the insurance companies , to the drug companies , to the fossil fuel industry this call for an economic centered brand of liberalism is what galvanized so many of his supporters , but his blunt language also served to remind some democrats of the divisive primary race there is little appetite for a replay of that fight in the d n c race , which will be decided by members of the committee when they gather in february for their winter meeting some top democrats had hoped to pre empt a contest by backing mr ellisons bid mr schumer , ms warren and an array of house members and unions were lining up behind him even before he formally entered the race but along with his inability to do the job full time and his links to mr sanders , mr ellisons past criticism of mr obama and praise for louis farrakhan , the nation of islam leader , worry some democrats looking for a figure to lead the opposition to mr trump mr ellison , a muslim , defended mr farrakhan in the 1990s , saying he was not an anti semite , and has positioned himself on the left flank of congressional democrats on israel jonathan greenblatt , the head of the anti defamation league , called mr ellison an important ally in the fight against anti semitism but said he had taken positions on the israeli palestinian conflict on which we strongly differ and that concern us we hope that all candidates for this post will make clear where they stand on these issues , and that the democratic national committee will make a choice that affirms the longstanding bipartisan consensus on a strong u s israel relationship , he said aides to mr ellison were going to make him available for a telephone interview , but then declined when informed that he would be asked about his past comments on mr farrakhan they emailed a list of his links to the jewish community and a statement that said , democrats need an organizer who will energize the grass roots across this country to build the party from the bottom up a handful of state democratic leaders have entered or are considering entering the race , and howard dean , the former vermont governor and d n c chairman , has also expressed interest but it is mr perez ,
well , that was interesting donald trump came to lunch at the new york times you can find all the highlights on the news pages , but since i had the opportunity to be included , let me offer a few impressions of my first close encounter with trump since he declared for the presidency the most important was that on several key issues like climate change and torture where he adopted extreme positions during his campaign to galvanize his base , he went out of his way to make clear he was rethinking them how far \? i dont know but stay tuned , especially on climate there are many decisions that president elect trump can and will make during the next four years many of them could be reversible by his successor but there is one decision he can make that could have truly irreversible implications , and that is to abandon americas commitment to phasing out coal , phasing in more clean energy systems and leading the world to curb co2 emissions before they reach a level that produces a cycle of wildly unpredictable climate disruptions when asked where he stood on that climate change issue which in the past he dismissed as a hoax and last decembers u s led paris emissions reduction accord , the president elect did not hesitate for a second im looking at it very closely i have an open mind to it were going to look very carefully you can make lots of cases for different views i will tell you this clean air is vitally important clean water , crystal clean water is vitally important do you think climate change is caused by human activity \? i think there is some connectivity , trump answered it is not clear how much , and what he will do about it depends on how much its going to cost our companies trump said he would study the issue very hard and hinted that if , after study , he was to moderate his views , his voice would be influential with climate skeptics on the question of whether the u s military should use waterboarding and other forms of torture to break suspected terrorists a position he advocated frequently during the campaign to great applause trump bluntly stated that he had changed his mind after talking with james n mattis , the retired marine corps general , who headed the united states central command trump said mattis told him of torture ive never found it to be useful \( many in the military and the c i a have long held this view \) he quoted mattis as saying , give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and i always do better than anyone using torture concluded trump , i was very impressed by that answer speaking of the middle east , trump said unprompted i would love to be able to be the one that made peace with israel and the palestinians , adding , i have reason to believe i can do that and he hinted that his son in law , jared kushner , could be his special envoy and hed be very good at it he knows the region \( wow , watching trump try to forge a deal between bibi netanyahu and the palestinians would be pay per view ! \) the one area where i think trump is going to have the hardest time delivering on his campaign promises is to create millions of good paying jobs by incentivizing and pressuring american companies to manufacture more in the u s he still talks about america as a manufacturing wasteland when , in fact , manufacturing remains the largest sector of the u s economy but employs far fewer workers as the management consultant warren bennis famously observed the factory of the future will have only two employees , a man and a dog the man will be there to feed the dog the dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment bottom line the campaign is over , but the struggle for donald trumps soul has just begun trump clearly learns by talking to people , not reading because so few thought he would win , many of those who gathered around him and had his ear were extreme characters but now that he has been elected president he is exposing himself to , and hearing from , a much wider net of people he mentioned that he had had telephone conversations with bill gates and with apple c e o tim cook and he stressed repeatedly that he wants to succeed i am doing this to do a good job to do that he needs to moderate many views and learn from a much wider network of people for those of us who opposed trumps election , it is not time to let down our guard and stop drawing redlines where necessary but for moderate republicans and democratic business leaders , like a bill gates , who can gain his ear and respect , and who have made big investments in clean energy , trump may be may be persuadable on some key issues they need to dive in now and try to pull him toward the center for a meeting between the newsmaker and this news organization that has covered him without fear or favor , the lunch was fairly relaxed , but not without some jousting asked if he read the new york times , trump said i do read it unfortunately i would live about 20 years longer if i didnt
in the summer of 2015 , katy tur , a london based foreign correspondent for nbc news , got a surprising offer from the networks head of news coverage would she like to cover donald j trumps presidential campaign \? he assured her that it would be a brief assignment six weeks at the most it was one of many assumptions about mr trumps candidacy that proved to be wildly off base ms tur was on the campaign trail for 18 months , living out of a suitcase and subsisting on hard boiled eggs , packets of peanut butter and fistfuls of cheez its she became a frequent target of mr trump on twitter and during his rallies , where he accused her of dishonesty and called her a third rate reporter , and she received death threats from his supporters on election night , expecting to cover his defeat , she instead reported on his victory speech ms tur will recount those experiences in a book , unbelievable , which will also explore mr trumps unexpected rise through the republican ranks and his ascension to the presidency ms turs memoir , which will be published by dey street books next year , is part of a coming deluge of postelection analysis , as agents , editors and publishers race to acquire books that explain the forces that propelled mr trump to victory and assess the future of american politics after a caustic and polarizing election it is a challenging task , made all the more daunting by the fact that few in the publishing world foresaw mr trumps rise as book publishers , we have a responsibility to take two steps back from the nowness of it all and find out whats going to be relevant five years from now , said julia cheiffetz , executive editor of dey street books its one of the most extraordinary moments in american history some political books and memoirs that were already in the works before election day will take on new resonance random house recently acquired a memoir by khizr khan , the pakistani american gold star father who became a prominent surrogate for hillary clinton after his stirring speech at the democratic national convention his memoir , which is scheduled to be published in 2017 , will tell the story of the khans move from pakistan to america the loss of their son , a captain in the army and their unexpected role in a heated national debate about immigration , patriotism and religious diversity their story of what its like to be a muslim in america , it feels even more pertinent after the election results , said ben greenberg , random houses executive editor other books will examine mr trumps populist appeal and how he capitalized on voters economic and social anxiety , or will try to place the trump phenomenon within a growing wave of populist and nationalist movements the journalist david neiwerts militialand usa the rise of the radical right in the age of trump , to be published by verso , will examine how mr trumps campaign helped extreme right wing voices find a place in the mainstream this month , atlantic books acquired the bbc broadcaster steve richardss the rise of the outsiders how the anti establishment is on the march , which will look at the populist sentiments that drove trump voters and the movement in britain to exit the european union a normal election year brings a barrage of books from campaign reporters , political pundits and academics , ranging from autopsies of the inner workings of a campaign to wonkier works that explore policies and social issues there have been some breakout campaign books in recent years , including game change a juicy post mortem of the 2008 election by the political reporters john heilemann and mark halperin , which sold nearly 500 , 000 print copies according to nielsen and books by obama campaign insiders like david plouffe and david axelrod and an outgoing administration typically produces a flood of memoirs from cabinet members , advisers and , of course , the president and first lady but this was far from a normal election year like many in the media , publishing industry executives were caught off guard by the results on nov 8 , and now find themselves scrambling people are curious , and people are baffled , and from the point of view of a publisher thats both an opportunity and a hurdle , because you need to find a way to explain what happened , said peter osnos , founder of the publishing imprint publicaffairs , who has worked on books by barack obama , bill clinton and jimmy carter the big question is who will emerge with something thats compelling , original , revelatory and provocative some publishers say theres little appetite for the traditional blow by blow account of a contentious campaign that was already the subject of almost nonstop daily news coverage \( mr halperin and mr heilemann declined to comment on whether they planned to write a book about the 2016 election \) it was such an exhausting campaign , and it was so exhaustively covered that you would really have to come at it in a different way , said john sterling , an editor at large at macmillan theres an evident hunger among readers for thoughtful and nuanced explanations of how mr trump rode a tide of discontent among white working class voters to the presidency immediately after the election , books like j d vances hillbilly elegy and george packers the unwinding , which both examine the countrys growing cultural and political divisions and the grievances of the white working class , shot up on amazons best seller lists mr vances book , which has 570 , 000 copies in print , sold more than 19 ,

houston before the election , gun rights activists were so worried hillary clinton would win the presidency that some of them bought extra ammunition and guns , fearing a crackdown on certain weapons , bullets and magazines theyre not worried now instead , since the election of donald j trump , gun advocates have been rejoicing , crowing about their political clout and plotting ways to eliminate many remaining curbs on gun ownership and use as they await one of the most vocal pro gun presidential candidates ever to enter the white house weve been threatened weve been bullied weve been ridiculed for eight years , said alice tripp , legislative director of the texas state rifle association , the state affiliate of the national rifle association i expect the tone to change if tone sets policy , then weve got it made it was more than just the outcome of the presidential race gun advocates played a role in flipping the state senate in iowa from blue to red and helped defeat a ballot initiative in maine that would have required universal background checks for gun sales the national rifle association spent 50 2 million in seven races this year by supporting mr trump and six republican senate candidates , and it lost only one race in nevada , according to an analysis by the center for responsive politics and the trace , a nonprofit news outlet that covers gun violence smart politicians all across the country are realizing that if we dont play ball with the second amendment we will find ourselves unemployed , said aaron dorr , executive director of iowa gun owners , whose members distributed information about candidates perceived as hostile to the second amendment in five state senate districts in each , the democratic incumbent lost in kansas and indiana , voters approved amendments enshrining the right to hunt and fish in their constitutions and in maine , david trahan , executive director of the sportsmans alliance of maine , which opposed the ballot question on universal background checks there , said concerns about restricting lawful gun transfers and a sense that outsiders were dictating maines political process had led to a backlash the measure was backed by everytown for gun safety , a group founded in part by michael r bloomberg , a former mayor of new york supporters of gun control said the national situation was more nuanced than the gun activists jubilation suggested they said it was impossible to say what role gun issues had played in mr trumps victory and disputed that the election was a national referendum on gun rights of the four high profile state ballot measures , gun control advocates won three and lost one , in maine in washington state , voters passed an initiative allowing for emergency court orders to temporarily block the right to possess a gun for people perceived as being at a higher risk of harming themselves or another person californians passed a measure requiring background checks to buy ammunition and nevada voters approved a ballot measure requiring background checks for almost all gun transfers , beyond what is required by federal law jennifer crowe , who campaigned for the background check measure in nevada , known as question 1 , said concerns about homicides and unchecked online gun sales had helped her side win despite opposition the more we spoke about the online marketplace and how robust it is , the more people seemed to understand the importance of question 1 as a public safety measure , ms crowe said erika soto lamb , a spokeswoman for everytown for gun safety , which supported the ballot items in maine , washington state and nevada , said the only true referendums on how americans view the issue of gun safety are the ballot measures she said the open discussion of gun control in the campaign and the state level wins suggested that what has long been considered a third rail issue was in fact a winning issue gun rights advocates say just the opposite , calling mrs clintons defeat a sign that gun control is an untouchable issue and anticipating an expansion of gun rights with a trump administration and a republican majority congress one of the policies being discussed would lift the restrictions that prohibit service members on military bases and at recruiting centers from being armed weapons rules at most military bases and centers prohibit service members who are not police or security personnel from carrying firearms , and mr trump has said he supports banning so called gun free zones on military bases the issue gained new attention after shootings at military sites , including at fort hood , tex , and in chattanooga , tenn if nidal hasan had had somebody shoot him back , he might have hurt and even killed a few people , but he wouldnt have killed as many as he did , said valente gonzalez , an administrator for the advocacy group open carry texas in the houston area , referring to the gunman who killed 13 people at fort hood in 2009 disarming law abiding people invites chaos other policies include a national right to carry , which would allow those with concealed handgun permits in one state to have their permits honored in the other 49 states such a move , known as national reciprocity , also has the backing of mr trump there is also a push to make silencers easier and less costly to purchase by removing them from the national firearms act we want broad deregulation of firearms , said dudley brown , the president of the national association for gun rights its high time republican majorities in the executive and legislative branches come in and make some broad , broad changes as the saying goes , dance with the ones who brung ya some gun owners were as surprised as anyone by mr trumps upset victory c
president elect donald j trump on tuesday expressed reservations about the use of torture but he did not disavow the practice , or his promise to bring it back and if he does , c i a doctors may be americas last defense against a return to savagery but theyll need to break sharply with what they did the last time around buried in a trove of documents released last summer is the revelation that c i a physicians played a central role in designing the agencys post sept 11 torture program the documents , declassified in response to an american civil liberties union lawsuit , show in chilling detail how c i a medicine lost its moral moorings its long been known that doctors attended torture as monitors whats new is their role as its engineers the documents include previously redacted language from a directive by the c i a s office of medical services telling physicians at clandestine interrogation sites to flout medical ethics by lying to detainees and collaborating in abuse this language also reveals that doctors helped to design a waterboarding method more brutal than what even lawyers for the george w bush administration allowed the directive counsels that clinical care not undermine the anxiety and dislocation that the various interrogation techniques are designed to foster it instructs physicians not to appear overly attentive and to confound patients expectations via deceit recommended tactics include doing clinical exams while pretending to be guards , changing medication schedules to disrupt detainees sense of time and hiding drugs in food it also outlines protocols for prolonged shackling in painful positions that would permit development of skin lesions and edema \( swelling because of leakage of fluid from blood vessels \) up to the knees sleep deprivation protocols call for a balance between breaking detainees resistance and preserving their capacity to provide information if forced wakefulness is intended to be one element in the process of demonstrating helplessness in an unpleasant environment , the directive counsels , two hour naps between days of sleeplessness are sufficient previously redacted language also discloses the origin of the degrading practice of rectal hydration , first reported by the senate select committee on intelligence in 2014 the medical service advised that individuals refusing adequate liquids be given fluids forcibly , through a rectal tube other language shows that c i a physicians collaborated in waterboarding more terrifying and dangerous than what government lawyers permitted the justice department allowed interrogators to simulate drowning for up to 40 seconds by using a wet cloth to block air flow through the nose and mouth but according to the directive , the medical service determined that a good air seal was not easily achieved by the wet cloth so it instead went along with pouring up to several liters of water onto captives faces the resulting occlusion , the directive said , was primarily from water filling the nasopharynx , breathholding , and much less frequently the oropharynx being filled rather than the sealing effect of the saturated cloth the drowning experience , in other words , wasnt simulated it was real that c i a interrogators actually employed this method is consistent with videotapes of waterboarding sessions a 2004 review of these since destroyed videos found that instead of using the wet cloth technique , interrogators continuously applied large volumes of water the review , by the c i a s inspector general , noted that this differed from what the justice department had authorized the agencys method , a psychologist interrogator told the inspector general , was more poignant and convincing the medical service instructed physicians to manage waterboardings dangers by combining the practice with sleep deprivation and shackling of detainees in stressful positions this , the service advised , could prolong the period of moderate use of the waterboard by reducing the intensity of its early use the service conceded in the recently released text that the abuse its doctors helped to plan put detainees at deadly risk inhalation of water , spasm of the larynx , hypothermia and lung and limb infections are among the hazards physicians were told to watch for the role of physicians included assessing the comparative efficacy of abusive methods the medical service judged extended sleep deprivation most effective because of its demonstrably cumulative contribution toward demonstrating helplessness in an unpleasant environment but it concluded that confinement in tiny boxes worked poorly since this offered a respite from interrogation , and it expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of waterboarding some of the agencys doctors challenged the torture programs efficacy and questioned why the psychologists who created it served in conflicting roles as both its managers and evaluators there were objections , as well , to the ethics of putting behavioral science to such brutal use but the programs advocates prevailed , and the medical service instructed its physicians accordingly there have been no public indications that any refused to go along unlike the contractor psychologists who created the torture program and have faced public excoriation , the c i a physicians who helped design it remain anonymous behind this cloak of invisibility , theyve acted as a rogue profession , contemptuous of medicines hippocratic commitment to patients an independent inquiry into what those physicians did and how they lost their ethical moorings is vital so are clear lines between acceptable and improper use of medical expertise for national security purposes the law of armed conflict sets standards for access to medical care for detainees , and clinical assessment is a potent tool for detecting abuse meanwhile , its urgent that american medicine sends a powerful , public message to president elect trump that there can be no place for medical participation in the engineering of cruelty , even in clandestine service to the nation and its critical that c i a and military doctors heed this message , even if they must defy orders to the contrary
the election has resurrected the fiasco of how to fix fannie mae and freddie mac shares of the two bailed out mortgage agencies have rocketed over the last two weeks on hopes that the trump administration might end government oversight big political roadblocks remain , though fannie and freddie , which buy or guarantee home loans , needed 188 billion of taxpayer aid in the 2008 financial crisis and were placed under government conservatorship debates about whether to reduce their role went nowhere because they play a large role in the 30 year mortgage market allowing them to shake off their government training wheels is a long way off even representative jeb hensarling , a republican and the house financial services committee chairman , reckons his plan to do so is a long shot worries about hurting the housing market , and in turn angering voters , are strong enough that some republican lawmakers would probably join their democratic rivals in opposing any such attempt there is one relatively easy tweak , though , that could please most sides allowing fannie and freddie to keep their earnings since 2012 they have been forced to hand over all profit as dividends to the treasury so far , they have sent 256 billion , none of which counts toward repaying the bailout that would allow them to rebuild their capital they currently have just 600 million each set aside against a total of 5 trillion of loans on their books , and that is scheduled to fall to zero in 2018 that raises the embarrassing prospect of one or both of them having to go cap in hand to uncle sam for another bailout in even a mild housing downturn avoiding that ought to appeal to lawmakers william a ackman , john paulson and other hedge fund managers who bought fannie and freddie stock after the crash have been pushing for this for some time , too including in the courts donald j trumps ascendancy to the white house has emboldened them , not least because steven mnuchin , a former goldman sachs partner who is a leading candidate to become treasury secretary , was a co investor with mr paulson in the mortgage lender indymac , recapitalizing it after its 2008 collapse and selling it last year to cit ending fannie and freddies status as an a t m for the government would still leave their bailout unpaid and their future status unresolved but it would be a smart first step
the future of financial regulation is murky given the conflicting statements by president elect donald j trump , congressional republicans and senate democrats some may panic , but looking at the whole picture , there may be some cause for optimism , a least when it comes to the big banks and the concept of too big to fail the starting point in all of this is mr trump himself his campaign rhetoric was hardly bank friendly he called for breaking up the big banks , as well as for enactment of a 21st century glass steagall act , the depression era law that separated commercial banking from investment banking , a restriction that was repealed during the clinton administration since then , big banks have become bigger the four largest banks jpmorgan chase , wells fargo , bank of america and citibank control more than 33 percent of banking assets , according to the federal reserve , and 43 percent of deposits the house republicans , led by jeb hensarling , who is said to be a candidate for treasury secretary , have proposed their own financial overhaul in a bill of more than 500 pages the bill , known as the financial choice act , which was proposed before mr trumps election , would substantially change the way banks are regulated under the 2010 dodd frank act dodd frank established a financial stability oversight board with power over systemic risk and the ability to designate nonbanks like insurance companies as systemically important it subjects big banks and other financial institutions to heightened regulation if those companies fail , dodd frank also established an orderly process for liquidating them capital charges were put on big banks , and the volcker rule limited trading by them , among a host of other requirements mr hensarlings house bill does away with much of this regulation instead , there is a chapter 14 inserted into the bankruptcy code to allow these entities to be reorganized in bankruptcy the volcker rule is repealed well capitalized banks have options to avoid the dodd frank restrictions these are not unreasonable changes the orderly liquidation authority was criticized because it required multiple approvals for liquidation with one day for a court to consider the decision , making it unlikely to be used and making liquidation anything but orderly the existence of an oversight board seems conceptually fine but also adds a layer of bureaucracy where the government has not proved particularly good at spotting financial crises \( neither has anyone else , frankly \) of course , the house bill has lots of other stuff the consumer financial protection bureau would be turned into a normal agency with commissioners appointed by the president its rule making authority would be limited , and it would be barred from limiting consumer arbitration as it is proposing the house bill also cuts a swath through other financial regulation it eliminates rules on credit card fees and the department of labors fiduciary duty standard it lowers the compensation disclosure requirements for public companies , including cutting the dodd frank requirement that companies disclose the amount and ratio of chief executive pay to the median employee salary will the trump plan or the house plan win out \? the simple trump plan seems to focus on making banks smaller and taking away the regulatory oversight and safety net on the other hand , the republican plan does not do away with financial regulation it simply makes what the republicans view as reasonable modifications to allow the banks to operate more effectively thrown into this mix are the senate democrats under the senate rules , 60 votes will be needed to bring any legislation revising dodd frank to a vote the republicans have 51 senators and maybe 52 , depending on the results of the louisiana runoff on dec 10 new yorks chuck schumer , the leader of the senate democrats , has already said that although there are areas of common ground on republican plans for infrastructure projects , there is no such agreement on financial regulation so assuming the democrats hold the line , any legislative repeal of dodd frank is unlikely and although some democrats may cross over , getting eight or nine will be almost impossible so where does that leave us \? very likely there will be a muddle areas where the president can act without congress are likely to see the most change if mr trump adopts the house republican mantra , things like the financial stability oversight board will wither the designation of systemically important financial institutions for insurance companies will also go away the rest will depend on what mr trump wants and who he picks for treasury secretary all three rumored potential candidates would seem to be more in favor of the republican house bill than the ideas mr trump put forth they may try a compromise that the democrats can buy into however , compromise can only go so far dismantling the consumer financial protection bureau is probably a nonstarter given that 60 senate votes are necessary to modify the bureaus status , it is likely to remain in fact , the agencys budget is protected from congress and the president it can continue on its current course , at least until mr trump appoints a new director in two years but there may be more common ground on how to deal with the big banks this is because the proposals in the house bill concerning bank regulation are worth discussing , and the houses changes to regulation of the big banks have credible support in reasonable quarters for example , the bankruptcy option seems more viable than a liquidation authority that will never be used in an op ed article in dealbook , professors david a skeel jr and mark j roe wrote that the core concept behind the bill bankruptcy for banks is sound , noting that there it needed
vilnius , lithuania lawmakers in lithuania chose as their new prime minister on tuesday a former police chief and interior minister who supports donald j trumps call for nato members to spend more on defense the choice of saulius skvernelis , 46 , to lead the government came a month after an election won by the peasants and greens union in a populist whirlwind the party is hard to classify it is an unorthodox grouping of farmers and environmentalists that leans left on economic issues but to the right on social issues other populist politicians in europe , like marine le pen in france , geert wilders in the netherlands and frauke petry in germany , oppose the european union , but the peasants and greens union favors membership in the bloc , which lithuania joined in 2004 the party strongly supports maintaining the sanctions imposed by the european union after russias 2014 military incursion in ukraine in some ways , lithuania is in a comparable situation to neighboring poland , where a right wing government took power last year polands new leaders are leery of the west , but also of mr trumps overtures toward the russian president , vladimir v putin lithuanias foreign minister , linas linkevicius , said last week that he was very afraid for the baltic states lithuania , latvia and estonia which sit along natos increasingly tense frontier with russia he expressed concern that russia might try to test the united states before mr trump takes office as president on jan 20 during the american election campaign , mr trump called on nato members to spend more for their collective security and rely less on the united states members are supposed to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on their military , but only the united states , britain , greece , poland and estonia do so now mr skvernelis said in a statement after his election on tuesday that lithuania would join them we are ready to increase financing for our military up to 2 percent by the end of 2017 2018 at the latest , he said on top of that , we will increase spending on interior security systems , such as border control , civil defense and intelligence services mr skvernelis said his government had full trust in the united states , as well as other partners in nato the european unions sanctions should be relaxed only when there is real progress on the ground from russias side , he said , but so far , the involvement of russian forces in georgia and ukraine does not imply willingness to cooperate in a neighborly spirit unlike the more prosperous countries of northwestern europe , lithuania worries about emigration , not immigration young people leave in search of jobs and higher living standards , and the population has been falling the peasants and greens union promised to stem the exodus by emphasizing the nations cultural heritage , luring investment to rural areas , and cleaning up corruption , especially in the health and defense ministries mykolas majauskas , 34 , a new lawmaker from the homeland union party , said the countrys political establishment bore much of the blame for the populist wave in the election last month people are clearly disappointed , and want someone to come in and make a change , he said mr skvernelis , the new prime minister , is viewed by some as the public face of a more powerful figure , ramunas karbauskis , the businessman who financed the peasants and greens union mazvydas jastramskis , a political scientist at vilnius university , said that the new prime minister was partly a mystery even for seasoned political observers lithuanians trust in the business sector is not that high , but they trust people who are seen as successful , he said , referring to mr karbauskis

this years election has forced americans to take notice of class divisions between workers and while these divisions may at first ring of lazy stereotypes the rural rust belt worker without a college degree and the coastal urban college educated worker theyre rooted in a real dynamic many of the most skilled workers young people with college degrees are leaving struggling regions of america for cities , specifically for cities in southern and coastal states there are clear economic reasons for their choice dense metro areas tend to produce more jobs and make workers more productive wages , for all kinds of workers , are also higher in theory , these incentives should prompt workers of all levels of education to move to metro areas but moving outside ones region is relatively rare these days , and even more rare for someone without a college degree moving is actually quite uncommon in advanced economies the united states has been one of the exceptions it has one of the highest rates of internal migration among advanced economies , and it has since at least the middle of the 19th century a study comparing thousands of american and british census records between 1850 and 1880 showed that nearly two thirds of american men moved across county lines , while only a quarter of british men did for americas first century , internal migration was largely driven by farming moving west to new land but toward the end of the 19th and in the early 20th century , migration began to be driven by people moving to american cities small and large this pattern added a twist after world war ii , when more people began moving outside their local region , particularly to the sunbelt before the 1940s , roughly 15 percent of americans lived outside a census division in which they were born , and by 1970 that had jumped to 25 percent but in the 1980s , people started moving less internal migration has been in gradual decline ever since across all demographic groups in the 1980s , 3 percent of men moved across state lines each year over the last decade that figure has dropped to 1 7 percent the decline is similar for women between 2001 and 2010 , the demographic groups with the lowest rate of interstate migration were people with less than a high school diploma \( 1 percent \) or nothing beyond a high school diploma \( 1 2 percent \) migration rates for college educated people were roughly twice that in the regional competition for the most skilled and most mobile workers in america , many noncoastal states are at a disadvantage although they have some large cities , they tend to be farther from other large cities than is the case in the coastal areas the economists stuart rosenthal and william strange looked at the benefits of density and found that they tend to dissipate over distances greater than five miles this advantage provided by clusters of cities is helpful for coastal states , which tend to contain many big metro areas , like san diego , los angeles , san jose and san francisco in california , or the so called acela corridor stretching from washington to boston but it can be bad news for inland areas with one or two large cities that are farther apart omaha and kansas city , mo , say or cleveland and columbus , ohio the flows of young college graduates out of a state can often be replaced by flows of young college graduates moving in the problem that many interior states face is that young college graduates moving into the state arent keeping up with those that are leaving lots of talented young people all over the country are eager to see new sights what is different , and a problem for michigan is that we have an unusually low rate of immigration , said charley ballard , a regional economist at michigan state university , in an email keeping young college graduates would help alleviate the effects of globalization and technological change on these local economies its not surprising that many states with net losses in their young and college educated populations also showed some big gains for donald j trump relative to mitt romneys performance in 2012 the map shows the total net migration figures for those with a college degree under 40 between 2000 and 2015 \( people who grew up in one state , went to college in another and then moved somewhere else are counted as migrating from the state where they attended college \) generally , rust belt and midwest states like ohio , michigan and iowa , and plains states like south dakota and nebraska have seen the largest net losses in younger , college educated people the places that are gaining college graduates tend to be coastal and southern states like california , maryland , texas and south carolina two exceptions to this trend are new york and massachusetts , states that also produce a large number of college graduates to begin with \( harsh winters and a high cost of living could be factors \) one reason that inland states have a reasonable case for disappointment at not keeping their young college graduates theyre helping to pay to educate them a majority of college graduates get their degrees from public universities , which are partly funded by state governments of course this doesnt diminish the other important benefits that public universities bring to each states economy , but if states are losing more college graduates than they are holding or bringing in , theyre effectively subsidizing other states skilled labor forces cities in these states do have some advantages the cost of living is lower , mostly because housing is cheaper outdoor recreation is often more accessible still , these areas are in a bind without jobs to offer , luring young college educated people
throughout this bitter election campaign , liberal celebrities like lady gaga , jennifer lawrence , lena dunham and lin manuel miranda used their powerful media platforms to sing hillary clintons praises now theyve invited their online followers to join them in processing her loss and protesting the impending administration of donald j trump i want to live in a countryofkindness where lovetrumpshate , lady gaga wrote on twitter the day after the election she added a photo of herself at a protest outside trump tower in manhattan , where she had climbed onto a truck in a strapless black jumpsuit and raised a pro clinton sign while the angry tweets , therapeutic instagram testimonials and fiery speeches may comfort their fans , these left leaning celebrities are also inadvertently energizing the opposition conservative news outlets most notably breitbart news network , the right wing populist enclave are perfecting the art of sapping democratic stars name recognition and repurposing their words and actions into pro trump material the enormous reach that celebrities enjoy , and the privileged bubble they live in , is wielded against them here , refashioned as evidence of the outsize control that the rich and famous have over regular americans this new battle in the culture wars is being waged not by bombastic , big name right wing commentators like rush limbaugh , but by nimble , often nameless online aggregators who quickly churn through popular culture and throw the most evocative stories to their readers , often without much commentary all it takes is a pointed headline , an unflattering photo and a few well chosen \( and real \) quotes like this lady gaga protests on sanitation truck outside trump tower , read breitbarts headline for its article on her tweet america is divided by its politics , its media , and as this election made even clearer , by its celebrity influencers in the weeks before the election , the

what it calls big hollywood , the glamour of celebrities becomes grist for the sites overarching narrative about the corrosive influence of the cultural elite the image ms dunham posted to instagram of a restorative trip to sedona , ariz , may have played as soothingly aspirational for an audience concentrated with young , coastal women , but to breitbarts demo , under the headline grieving lena

mr ponomarev , a new york times photojournalist , and mr arango , the timess baghdad bureau chief , are in northern iraq covering the mosul offensive and the intensifying humanitarian crisis surrounding it each day , dozens of families pick their way out , some carrying white flags even as they come under mortar or sniper fire from the islamic state billowing black clouds from oil wells set on fire by militants provide a dystopian background to the scenes of flight it is so bad south of mosul that the sheep there have begun turning black the military campaign to retake mosul , iraqs second largest city , is in its sixth week and bogged down in a grueling fight seeking to escape the fighting , more civilians than ever are taking the risk of evacuation , hoping to find help if they can make it past the militants gun range the numbers tell one story almost 70 , 000 people have been displaced so far , roughly half of them children , according to the united nations but the exodus is really only getting started there could be a million more people still in mosul , most clustered on the west of the tigris river , where the fighting has not reached for those who have been able to reach the aid camps miles outside the city , there has been an initial glimpse of hope and relief some , like these displaced iraqis at the khazer camp outside mosul , find that aid workers and soldiers are quick to offer food , handing out cookies or iraqs traditional diamond shaped bread but it is a particularly hazardous journey for military age men fearing that islamic state fighters will try to escape by posing as civilians , the iraqi forces are separating men from their families for questioning in past offensives , the process proved ripe for abuse the word of an unnamed informant can be enough to send a man to prison , leaving countless families wondering what happened to their husbands and sons these men were questioned by iraqi intelligence officers outside qayyara , south of mosul as the war against the islamic state has intensified , more than three million iraqis mostly sunnis are now thought to be displaced with most of them still unable to return to their homes even in cities long ago reclaimed from the islamic state , like falluja and ramadi , aid camps have had to serve as home amid the worries , there are still touching scenes of reunions at the camps , as family members who had left two years ago are brought together with loved ones who had stayed behind until now , like this group of relatives at the khazer camp a few weeks ago , zakea muhsin , 55 , from the village of topzawa near mosul , saw her husband for the first time in more than two years she hadnt even been able to talk with him over those months , as the islamic state had banned communication with the outside world they told us , if we find a cellphone on you , we will behead you , she said but just as often , there is more separation , families cut off from one another amid the chaos of battle last week , awad abdullah , 47 , who had left an area south of mosul and lives in a camp near erbil , was grief stricken because he could not find his parents i have not heard from them , he said i am always crying as he spoke , an older woman approached with a sad story of a lost daughter nobody knows where she is , she said when the battle began , everyone hoped the islamic state would abandon the city , as it had in falluja instead , it dug in for a last stand with the fighting becoming ever more brutal and drawn out , humanitarian workers are concerned that iraqi forces will adopt more aggressive tactics , putting civilians at greater risk when the fight started , iraqi officers worried the islamic state would destroy the bridges over the tigris that connect east and west mosul , cutting off trapped civilians now coalition warplanes are knocking the bridges out themselves to prevent the islamic state from bringing supplies and car bombs into the battle scarred east already , there is talk of an aleppo style siege of the city center and the united nations is busily expanding some camps and building more to accommodate perhaps hundreds of thousands more displaced civilians , like in the rapidly expanding jaadah camp below some fear that the increasing number of refugees , and their vulnerability , could bring another wave of sectarian revenge in a country rife with it sunni extremists who would later identify with the islamic state forged their identity with the widespread killing of shiites during iraqs sectarian civil war last decade , and again when the militant group blitzed across iraq in 2014 , when mosul and other cities were seized but the groups sectarian focus did not keep it from oppressing sunni civilians under its rule now hundreds of thousands of them are refugees , flowing into areas like iraqi kurdistan , where they are met with suspicion and where memories of abuses under saddam husseins sunni arab oligarchy are still fresh today , the fighting drags on , and each day there are more families trickling out of the battleground in a new iraqi ritual of coming and going when the mosul offensive began in earnest , in mid october , some american officials quietly expressed hope that it might be wrapped up by the end of president obamas term but most public estimates envisioned a fight stretching over months , and that appears to be coming true many iraqi officials now predict the mosul fight could stretch on until the
earlier today the new york times had an exclusive interview with donald trump see how it unfolded on our live blog president elect donald j trump is moving toward choosing his domestic policy team , suggesting that the retired neurosurgeon ben carson could be his housing secretary and speaking at length to a democrat , michelle rhee , about education meantime , mr trump suggests that his son in law will bring peace to the middle east and seems to reverse tack on climate change through his spokesman , ben carson has said he does not have the experience to run a major federal agency , yet there he was , cozying up to be the next secretary of housing and urban development what a neurosurgeon knows about housing policy is not clear , but mr carson is clearly in the running well , you know our inner cities are in terrible shape , and they definitely need some real attention , he told fox news on tuesday you know , there have been so many promises made over the last several decades and nothing has been done the housing post was one of the offers thats on the table , mr carson confirmed another name surfacing for a domestic cabinet post \? its former representative harold ford jr , a moderate democrat , as possible transportation secretary why mr ford \? he is a frequent guest on msnbcs morning joe , and the co host joe scarborough has the president elects ear michelle rhee , a democrat who has been willing to ruffle feathers on education , didnt exactly take herself out of the running to be mr trumps education secretary , but she did push back at critics who do not approve of her visits to trump tower mr trump , as it turns out , didnt care all that much about mrs clintons private email server but there are consequences when his senior adviser , kellyanne conway , announced that the incoming administration would not pursue the investigation of mrs clintons private email server , the response from the right was swift broken promise , blared breitbart , the conservative website that promoted mr trumps candidacy and gave him the mastermind of his campaign , stephen k bannon the conservative provocateur ann coulter was no more subtle judicial watch , the conservative legal organization that has doggedly pursued mrs clinton and former president bill clinton , also chimed in ms conway said tuesday that it was now mr trumps intention to move beyond the issues of the campaign and focus on the task of running the country instead if donald trump can help her heal , then perhaps thats a good thing , ms conway said on the msnbcs morning joe of course , the attorney general is supposed to be independent , but things may not work the usual way with president trump i think when the president elect , whos also the head of your party , tells you before hes even inaugurated that he doesnt wish to pursue these charges , it sends a very strong message , tone and content to fellow republicans , ms conway said rudolph w giuliani , the former new york city mayor who is expected to serve somewhere in the new administration , told the news media at trump tower that the president elect was making a tough call look , theres a tradition in american politics that after you win an election , you sort of put things behind you , mr giuliani said and if thats the decision he reached , thats perfectly consistent with sort of a historical pattern of things come up , you say a lot of things , even some bad things might happen , and then you can sort of put it behind you in order to unite the nation so if he made that decision , i would be supportive of it id also be supportive of continuing the investigation but mr trump has lofty ambitions james mattis , a former marine corps general , is no fan of waterboarding , which could present problems if he becomes secretary of defense why \? because the president elect is a really big fan as recently as monday night , president elect trump said in a video that he would scuttle president obamas energy and environmental regulations put in place to fight climate change to unleash coal and hydraulic fracturing yet in his meeting tuesday with times reporters and editors , he seemed to soften on climate change , which he used to call a hoax but donna brazile , the interim chairwoman of the democratic national committee , took to medium to make the case that democrats need not panic , but they do need to get back to work on the one hand , she noted on the other , with republican gains in state legislatures , the party is working off a structural disadvantage she explained as a candidate , mr trump proposed ramping up surveillance of mosques and a moratorium on muslim immigration , compelling to a surge in american muslims registering to vote surprisingly , a lot of them actually voted for mr trump according to an exit poll of 2 , 000 muslim voters conducted by the council on american islamic relations , or cair , 13 percent backed mr trump , while 74 percent supported mrs clinton that is nearly twice as much support as mitt romney , the 2012 republican nominee , received from muslim voters four years ago robert mccaw , a spokesman for cair , said mr trumps strength with muslims was somewhat surprising , but that about 15 percent of muslims do identify themselves as republicans and that mrs clinton did little direct outreach to muslims there were aspects of trumps candidacy that either appealed to them or it was a vote against hillary clinton , mr mccaw said it might
ive been thinking a lot about the best imaginable trump voter this is the trump supporter who wasnt motivated by racism or bigotry this is the one who cringed every time donald trump did something cruel , vulgar or misogynistic but this voter needed somebody to change the systems that are failing her she needed somebody to change the public school system that serves the suburban children of professors , journalists and lawyers but has left her kids under skilled and underpaid she needed some way to protect herself from the tech executives who give exciting speeches about disruption but dont know anything about the people actually being disrupted she is one of those people whom joan c williams writes about in the harvard business review who admires rich people but disdains professionals the teachers who condescend to her , the doctors who dont make time for her , the activists whose definition of social justice never seems to include the suffering people like her experience this voter wants leaders tough enough to crack through the reigning dysfunction , and sure enough , trumps appointments so far represent the densest concentration of hyper macho belligerence outside a drill sergeant retirement home this voter wants a philosophic change of course , and trump offers that , too the two party establishments are mired in their orthodoxies , but trump and his appointees are embodiments of the nationalism espoused by pat buchanan , the most influential public intellectual in america today buchanans organizing worldview is embodied in visceral form in the person of steve bannon the globalists gutted the american working class and created a middle class in asia , bannon said in his hollywood reporter interview the new political movement , he said , is everything related to jobs he vowed to drive conservatives crazy with a gigantic spending program to create jobs he vowed to use that money to create a new new deal that will win over 40 percent of the black and hispanic vote , creating a neo jacksonian majority that will govern for 50 years its not my cup of tea , but i can see why some good people might be willing to tolerate trump and bannons personalities in order to pursue it thinking about this best voter has helped me take an emotional pause many of my fellow trump critics are expressing outrage , depression , bewilderment or disgust theyre marching or writing essays should we normalize trump or fight the normalizers \? it all seems so useless during this transition moment its all a series of narcissistic displays and discussions about our own emotional states it seems like the first thing to do is really learn what this election is teaching us second , this seems like a moment for some low passion wonkery its stupid to react to every trump tweet outrage with your own predictable howls its silly to treat politics and governance purely on cultural grounds , as a high school popularity contest , where my sort of people denigrates your sort of people weve arrived at the moment of actual governing weve arrived at the moment when trump has to turn his vague notions into concrete proposals trump promised to rip up the iran deal , but he seems to be realizing there are six other signatories and weve lost leverage with the iranians because we already gave them back their money trump promises to repeal obamacare , but how do you do that when it has already been woven into the fabric of every health care system in america \? whether its reforming immigration or trade policy , his governing challenge is going to be astoundingly hard and complicated surely this is not the moment to get swept up in our own moral superiority , but rather to understand the specificity of the proposals he comes up with and to offer concrete amendments and alternatives to address the same problems finally , surely a little universal humility is in order orthodox republicans spent the last 30 years talking grandly about entrepreneurialism while the social fabric around their core voters disintegrated maybe a little government action would have helped \? the democratic party is losing badly on the local , state and national levels if you were a football team youd be 2 8 maybe you can do better than responding with the sentiment sadly , the country isnt good enough for us those of us in the opinion class have been complaining that trump voters are post truth , that they dont have a respect for expertise well , the experts created a school system that doesnt produce skilled graduates the experts designed obamacare exchanges that are failing maybe those of us in the professional class need to win back some credibility the old fashioned way , with effective reform there will be plenty of time to be disgusted with trumps bigotry , narcissism and incompetence its tempting to get so caught up in his outrage du jour that you never have to do any self examination but lets be honest it wouldnt kill us trump critics to take a break from our never ending umbrage to engage in a little listening
milwaukee i love telling people im from wisconsin maybe its my defense mechanism for when people accuse me of being a coastal elite , out of touch with real america i like fulfilling all the wisconsin stereotypes i love cheese and cheese curds , of course i love our sports teams out of a vague sense of homerism and my accent \( all hard as \) comes out in full force after ah couplah beers mostly i love my grandma , who has called wisconsin home for 88 years her parents immigrated to wisconsin from germany , and she started public school without knowing a word of english she forgot most of the german her parents taught her years ago , but taught me the words to the liechtensteiner polka that we would sometimes hear when my family would go to a friday night fish fry up until nov 8 , i still believed my states moral baseline bent toward empathy the wisconsin i thought i knew , where i lived for 21 years , was filled with complex but fundamentally decent people who recognized that everyone is deserving of respect and could disagree without being disagreeable the state did elect scott walker as governor in 2010 , and the republican led legislature gutted public sector unions , setting off huge protests in the capitol but i didnt think that state would vote for donald j trump , turning its 10 electoral votes to a republican for the first time since 1984 \( i mean , come on , we even voted for dukakis \) as much as mr trump won the election in wisconsin , hillary clinton lost it her campaign , which prided itself on employing all the data wizards and ground game gurus money can buy , did not do nearly enough to lock down the upper midwest , particularly wisconsin and michigan , and instead treated those states as a given paul soglin is the mayor of madison , wisconsins capital city , in cerulean dane county he supported senator bernie sanders in the democratic primary , and said he talked at least once a week with a field organizer from the sanders campaign during the primary but once mrs clinton locked up the nomination , it was radio silence from the clinton campaign since i first held elected office in the early 70s , virtually every presidential election , ive been contacted , either by the candidate or by a staffer , he told me im not saying this to say im important but the point is , not only wasnt she in the state , but i never got a call , a contact , anything after the primary president obama , by contrast , made two campaign stops in madison during the 2012 election , including a huge rally with bruce springsteen on the monday before election day mr soglins frustration with the clinton campaign was apparent i dont understand the strategy ive never seen an explanation for it , other than assuming that they wanted not just a victory , but a smashing victory actually , the kind that donald trump had , he said wisconsins voter turnout in 2016 was the lowest its been in 20 years roughly 40 , 000 fewer democrats voted in milwaukee county this year than did in 2012 the drop in turnout in milwaukee county might be partially attributed to a voter identification law in the state in 2014 , a federal judge found that roughly 300 , 000 registered voters in wisconsin lacked the necessary photo id card to vote under the new law , and a substantial number of those voters were low income however , election watchers have said the voter id law alone could not have flipped the state in mr trumps favor mrs clinton did not visit wisconsin once after the democratic national convention in july neither did president obama or michelle obama mr sanders made multiple trips to the state on behalf of mrs clinton , but that was not enough to gin up voters enthusiasm like most of the country , my friends and family in wisconsin were shocked that mr trump won the state , and the election my mom says shes still in denial my dad has progressed comfortably to anger my grandma , though , has been coping with the election result with characteristic wit after listening to donald trump speeches about hate , i was convinced its o k to hate , she emailed me therefore , i hate donald trump throughout the general election , the clinton campaigns surrogates appeared reassured to the point of hubris that they would be able to convert moderate republican voters in midwestern suburbs for every blue collar democrat we lose in western pennsylvania , we will pick up two moderate republicans in the suburbs in philadelphia , and you can repeat that in ohio and illinois and wisconsin , new york senator chuck schumer said in july this line of thinking was not just wrong , but disastrously so in 2008 , barack obama won 59 of wisconsins 72 counties this year , 59 counties voted for donald trump republicans successfully built on the map that helped to elect mr walker to the governors mansion while the clinton campaign was looking to run up the score in states like arizona and georgia a triumvirate of wisconsin republicans also helped elect mr trump , both actively and passively first , there is reince priebus , who worked his way up from republican politics in wisconsin to head the republican national committee , and now , to serve as mr trumps chief of staff then there is house speaker paul d ryan , who now has a historic opportunity to pass his agenda through congress finally , mr walker , recovered from his own failed presidential campaign , will now oversee the republican governors association charlie sykes is a longtime
for the last four years , new york democrats have had to contend with an only in albany riddle in a 63 member state senate with slightly more democrats than there are republicans , how do the republicans manage to hold a majority \? the answer often lies with one rogue democrat senator simcha felder , who votes with the republicans and whose heavily democratic , overwhelmingly orthodox jewish district in brooklyn voted just as overwhelmingly for president elect donald j trump to the democrats endless frustration , mr felder has never once caucused with members of his own party , defecting to the other side of the aisle within days of being elected in 2012 this year , the democrats long electoral migraine did not lift with absentee ballots in two close races on long island still being counted to settle the final senate margins , the democrats would need to win at least one of those , lure back the seven member independent democratic conference which has teamed up with the republicans to govern the senate for several years and reclaim mr felder in order to form a working majority but mr felder declined to come along , revealing on sunday night that he would remain a republican in senate allegiance if not in name , telling the political television program capital tonight that he would have to have a compelling reason to leave the republican caucus the mainstream democrats offer , he said , had fallen short \( mr felder , who ran on the republican as well as the conservative and democratic ballot lines for the first time this year , said the republicans had not promised him anything specific \) as the voter rolls have it , the district which is dominated by hasidic and other orthodox jewish residents in the borough park , kensington and midwood neighborhoods is heavily democratic , the better to register influence in city democratic primaries , which often determine the outcome of general elections but party affiliation often bows to parochial concerns here mr felders constituents , many of whom send their children to yeshivas , want the state to provide tuition assistance for religious schools , among other faith driven issues , and senate republicans have been far more receptive to taking measures that would benefit religious education than the democrats the district went for mr trump , a republican , by large margins it was also an easy pickup for mitt romney four years ago their allegiance is to their foundational religious practices and beliefs , not necessarily party identity , said michael tobman , a brooklyn based political consultant who has worked on several races involving orthodox communities democratic leaders have considered trying to oust mr felder in a primary battle before , but his popularity in the district makes him all but immune to challenges he cant lose , mr tobman said if they primary him , they could say goodbye to any possible rapprochement in the future still , democrats responded on monday to mr felders decision with overt appeals to party unity its a shame , given how important its going to be to hold the line at the state level against what we expect to be very draconian efforts out of washington , that were likely to have a majority of the senate be elected democratic and still not be able to govern , said senator michael n gianaris of queens , who serves as the democrats chief political strategist a spokesman for the republicans , scott reif , said of mr felder , we look forward to continuing to work with him to move this state forward without mr felder , the mainstream democrats would need to win the contested long island races and strike a deal with senator jeffrey d klein , the leader of the independent democrats emerging from election day without much clarity on which party would end up with a numerical advantage , both sides , as so often before , have hastened to pay court to mr felder and mr klein before ending the suspense about his decision , mr felder met with senator andrea stewart cousins , the westchester county democrat who leads the mainstream conference , as well as john j flanagan , the republican senate majority leader , saying as recently as last week that he would join whichever side offered him the best deal he also got a call from gov andrew m cuomo , a democrat , who , in his efforts to position new york as a liberal foil to mr trumps washington , may have a greater interest than usual in installing a true democratic majority
washington civil rights groups called on president elect donald j trump on monday to publicly condemn extremist movements that are espousing racism in his name after hundreds of white nationalist sympathizers spent the weekend in washington debating ways to preserve white culture mr trump has been accused of fanning the flames of hate groups with his hard line positions on immigration , his hesitance to denounce the former klansman david duke and his occasional promotion of white nationalist accounts on twitter while mr trump has called for an end to hate crimes and said he wants to bring the country together , he has not been full throated on expressing disapproval of the alt right , a rebranded white nationalist movement we would like him to stand up and denounce these folks , heidi beirich , who tracks hate groups for the southern poverty law center , said of mr trump its inexplicable the longer it goes on , the more you have to wonder if its not intentional the conference , held at a federal building named after ronald reagan , drew about 275 attendees from around the country and attracted droves of anti fascist protesters speakers preached the virtues of a white ethno state , railed against jews and lauded mr trumps election as a victory with nazi salutes jonathan greenblatt , the national director of the anti defamation league , said that mr trump should not be blamed for every hate group that invoked his name , but that he should be doing more to discredit people using his election to make prejudice mainstream to have a group like this convening steps away from the white house proclaiming that what happened two weeks ago was a great victory for them and their ideas , there is value for the president elect stating clearly that these are not american values , that their ideology is in conflict with american ideals , mr greenblatt said after hillary clinton gave a major address attacking the alt right over the summer , mr trump said that he had never heard of the movement and that nobody even knows what it is on monday , hope hicks , a spokeswoman for mr trump , said the president elect disapproved of all hate groups mr trump has always denounced these groups and individuals associated with a message of hate , ms hicks said mr trump will be a president for all americans however , he totally disavows the support of this group , which he does not want or need but white nationalists showed no sign of being ready to abandon mr trump richard b spencer , the head of the national policy institute , which sponsored the weekend conference , said that mr trumps win had lifted the spirits of what he described as a radical movement and that he hoped to ride the enthusiasm by pitching policy papers on subjects such as foreign policy and immigration to the administration my goal for the next five years is professionalization , said mr spencer , who has become the face of the alt right that is the next step for the alt right but the conference demonstrated how far the group remained from the political mainstream and the challenges it faced explaining to the public that a desire for a white state was different from blatant racism as the conference concluded , mr spencer shouted hail our people ! and hail victory ! the english translation of the nazi exhortation sieg heil ! some members of the crowd shouted back and raised their arms in nazi salutes asked on monday about the comments , mr spencer said he had gotten caught up in his passion for the alt right cause my talk certainly was strident , and it definitely was about getting a rise out of people and expressing excitement , he said theres a lot of cheekiness going on and exuberance of the salute that is synonymous with anti semitism , he said , that was a rhetorical flourish
beirut , lebanon the united nations special envoy to syria offered unsolicited advice on monday to president elect donald j trump pay attention to what happens between now and january in syria , particularly in aleppo , the storied city at risk of obliteration by russian backed syrian forces the envoy , staffan de mistura , suggested that mr trumps shared desire with russia to collaborate to annihilate the islamist militants ensconced in eastern aleppo and elsewhere presented new circumstances that could alter the war for better or worse while such a collaboration could be effective in eradicating the islamic state , mr de mistura said during an interview in beirut , the carnage and destruction caused by the syrian and russian militaries in syria increasingly make it more problematic politically for mr trump to align with russia mr de misturas remarks , after a weekend of frustrating diplomacy in syria , represented the first time that he had spoken about mr trumps potential role in the war through the president elects eagerness to work with russia , which backs the government of president bashar al assad of syria if russia desires a new approach with the incoming trump administration on syria , mr de mistura said , it could be difficult for any president in the united states , regardless of his own priorities , to ignore the international outrage over the humanitarian tragedy in aleppo unless drastic steps are taken , mr de mistura said , eastern aleppo will not be there by the new year in terms of structural destruction for now , the syrian governments apparent determination to eradicate the anti government insurgents in eastern aleppo appears to have overwhelmed all other considerations while the bombing of aleppo abated during mr de misturas visit to damascus on saturday and sunday , it resumed as he was departing on monday humanitarian agencies have pleaded for respite from the assaults , which they say have destroyed or incapacitated all hospitals in the rebel held part of the city at the united nations on monday , the organizations top relief official told the security council that he was more or less at my wits end as a human being about the suffering in aleppo and other besieged parts of syria we are not just seeing a resumption of violence in aleppo this is not business as usual , said the relief official , stephen obrien , the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator what has been unleashed on civilians this past week is yet another low in an unrelenting inhuman onslaught mr de mistura went to syria with a short term proposal to help civilians in aleppo , which included the evacuation of about 200 wounded people at risk of dying because their injuries cannot be treated in a war zone the delivery of medical supplies and food aid for the most vulnerable the emergency plan would also allow doctors , who have been working around the clock , to rotate out for rest the syrian government rejected all tenets of mr de misturas plan except the evacuation of the wounded mr de mistura has also proposed asking the fighters who are part of the nusra front , the al qaeda affiliate operating in syria , to voluntarily leave east aleppo to allow aid deliveries for the civilians there syrias foreign minister , walid al moallem , has rejected that proposal mr de mistura nonetheless believes the russians are sympathetic to his ideas for aleppo , he said , because they do not want to be seen as helping to destroy the historic city in articles quoting russian sources and disseminated by the russian based sputnik news agency and by a chinese newspaper , russia has sent decidedly mixed messages about its intentions in the sputnik articles , the officials criticized the united nations for having failed to use a pause in the aleppo bombing this fall to evacuate wounded people the articles also said traces of chlorine and white phosphorus bombs had been found in attacks on government held western aleppo if true , the claims would suggest rebels are using banned weapons mr assads forces have also been accused of using banned weapons , including by a united nations panel of inquiry however , chinas peoples daily newspaper has asserted that russia is not participating in the bombing , suggesting that as mr de mistura indicated , russia does not want to be associated with the flattening of aleppo and untold civilian casualties the newspaper also suggested that mr trumps election victory might factor into what it described as russias reluctance at this stage russia all the more does not want any trouble with regard to civilian casualties on the syrian battlefield and other issues that could complicate bilateral relations , the newspaper said
washington lobbyists , financial and policy analysts and wall street insiders are all trying to figure out what the trump administration will mean for the banking industry but rusty cloutier never doubted that mr trump would be good for the small bank he runs in lafayette , la mr cloutier sees in the new administration a chance not just for regulatory relief , but for a reordering of priorities away from the wealthy interests of the big cities and toward the rural and blue collar communities where he operates my customers are very hard working people , said mr cloutier , the president of midsouth bank they work in the oil fields and they hear they are racist , and they just got tired of it being slammed in their face he added , tell your editors that they need to run a headline that says main street won and yet , in the weeks since mr trumps surprise election , wall street has been winning , too the stocks of bank of america and jpmorgan chase have been soaring to their highest levels in years a rally of such force that it has caught many bank executives and analysts by surprise the surge , for example , has more than restored all the value in wells fargos share price that was eroded after the scandal over the rampant creation of unauthorized bank accounts erupted in september for now , banks both large and small are benefiting from expectations that the president elect will roll back regulations on just about every aspect of the industry , including the fees banks can charge , whom they can lend to and how much capital they have to hold banks would also benefit from the higher interest rates that are expected if a trump administrations fiscal stimulus program revives inflation higher rates would increase the value of some of the banks holdings and would widen banks margins on loans but like nearly all of mr trumps policy positions , his plan for banking regulation has not been explained in any great detail mr trumps feelings on banks , perhaps more so than other industries , are difficult to sort out on one hand , he has called for dismantling the 2010 dodd frank financial overhaul that is credited with reining in risk taking but blamed for crimping profits on the other , he has railed against wall street elites for keeping down small town america how , then , will mr trump justify policies that bolster bank profits , while also delivering on his promises of economic populism \? community bankers see themselves in the sweet spot they say mr trump can limit regulations particularly on banks with less than 10 billion in assets while still being tough on the wall street banks that were the driver of the financial crisis and so much anger among the general public freeing up community banks from the qualified mortgage rule and rigorous anti money laundering guidelines , for example , would allow them to spend less time and resources complying with regulation and more on making loans and lifting the fortunes of the rural america mr trump championed in his campaign several community bankers said they also wanted the trump administration to rein in the consumer financial protection bureau by installing a five person bipartisan oversight board , rather than a single director among community bankers , support for mr trump has been pervasive and consistent roughly 84 percent of community bankers supported mr trump , according to a poll that the industrys trade group conducted after the political conventions this summer i didnt have any trump signs in my yard , said tim zimmerman , president of standard bank , which operates in communities outside pittsburgh but i want the bank to do well and to be able to help people in the community and i cant do that if things go the way they are going in reality , the nations roughly 5 , 800 community banks represent a relatively small part of americas banking activity about half of the nations deposits are held by just a handful of mega banks , where there was deep support for hillary clinton many on wall street helped bankroll mrs clintons campaign in the hope that she would protect the forces that drive their global profits , like free trade many executives at large banks feared that mr trump was a loose cannon who could destabilize the economy the chief executive of goldman sachs , lloyd c blankfein , went so far as to publicly voice support for mrs clinton he made a cameo in a pro trump ad along with janet l yellen , the chairwoman of the federal reserve , and the investor george soros that painted the democrats as puppets of the global financial elite critics called the ad anti semitic because it focused on jewish figures but as the stock market soared , the big banks began talking about the upside of a trump presidency two days after the election , mr blankfein said at the dealbook conference sponsored by the new york times that he believed mr trumps policies would be market supportive unprepared for a trump victory , executives inside the big banks began drawing up lists of regulations or rules that the new administration and the republican controlled congress might change for their benefit they are not arguing for the repeal of dodd frank , which large banks have spent hundreds of millions of dollars complying with nor do they want a less powerful consumer protection agency , which some credit with helping big banks by cracking down on players on the industrys margins , like payday lenders at the top of their wish list rolling back the so called durbin amendment , which limits the fees banks can charge on debit cards , and tweaking the volcker rule so that large banks can engage in more types of
to the editor re hamilton plea sets stage for a trump clash \( front page , nov 20 \) many republicans whine \( often on dubious grounds \) about supposed threats to free speech from political correctness on college campuses and elsewhere they admonish liberals to grow a tougher skin and put up with speech or views they disagree with or even find offensive we now see how thin skinned and hypocritical president elect donald trump is when the shoe is a bit tight on the other foot a hamilton cast member , brandon victor dixon , engaged in a very brief , polite and thoughtful exercise of his constitutional right to free speech when he urged vice president elect mike pence \( attending the show \) to uphold our american values and show more concern for people who understandably feel threatened by the rhetoric of the incoming trump pence administration by lashing out at mr dixon and ordering him to apologize ! \( for urging support for american values \? \) , president elect trump proves the very point that mr dixon was trying to make , and sends a disturbing signal about his lack of respect for the constitution he must swear to uphold on jan 20 bryan h wildenthal san diego the writer is a professor of constitutional law at thomas jefferson school of law to the editor the curtain call taunt of a hamilton cast member to vice president elect mike pence was a public and premature chastisement , grossly impolite and impolitic it was a perfect example of liberal cultural overreach , importune and embarrassing to a decent man whose only offense was to have given the show his nonpolitical attendance art and politics are often mixed , but post performance editorializing to a particular member of the audience is simply bad manners peter hutchinson phippsburg , me to the editor there is good reason that donald trump clings to his controversial twitter account its utility was apparent when he accused the cast of hamilton of harassing mike pence some have interpreted his tweets as marks of a thin skinned , irrational man this is misguided mr trump has risen to power by creating conflict and manipulating social and news media , often through his tweets the hamilton tweets serve mr trump in two ways first , he uses them to ignite a firestorm around a relatively trivial issue to divert attention away from real problems plaguing him and his nascent administration in this case , it diverts attention away from his 25 million trump university fraud settlement second , he again succeeds at pitting the urban progressive against the rural conservative , creating a false antagonism and solidifying his base the media should pivot away from sensationalized controversies that mr trump appears to savor and instead focus on the major issues this country is facing if not , he continues to manipulate us all lauren browne brooklyn to the editor regarding the boos that greeted him on entering the richard rodgers theater on friday night , and the appeal of the hamilton cast to him during the curtain call , mike pences comment was noteworthy thats what freedom sounds like , he said to his daughter , attending the performance with him this is the response of a mature man who may actually believe in democracy howard rosenfield brunswick , me to the editor so donald trump thinks the cast of hamilton owes mike pence an apology i think its precisely the opposite mr pence has fought l g b t rights for years , including a call for conversion therapy yet here he is , all dressed up for a night at the theater in which the new lead is a gay man once again , such hypocrites want to partake of the art given them by gay people but do not wish to respect them as human beings or lend them dignity this is reminiscent of the days in which artists such as sammy davis jr or lena horne were not allowed to stay in the hotels in which they performed yes , mr pence , you apologize douglas soesbe sherman oaks , calif
president elect donald j trump said during the campaign that he would push companies to bring manufacturing jobs back to the united states he named one tech company in particular apple which is the worlds largest public company and makes many of its gadgets overseas apple does make one product domestically the mac pro desktop computer is assembled in austin , tex , through the contract manufacturer flex so vindu goel , a new york times tech reporter , recently visited austin to see what having tech manufacturing domestically has wrought for apple and the area what he found was a more nuanced picture showing that manufacturing is far from the only way for a tech company to provide good jobs and career paths for americans it turns out apple has a campus in austin where the number of jobs has grown rapidly , reaching about 6 , 000 jobs now , up from around 2 , 100 seven years ago the roles that apple has created there are varied , including fielding tech support calls , overseeing logistics with suppliers and updating apples maps software the average salary of apples austin employees , including management , is 77 , 000 a year the manufacturing jobs at flexs austin location , located about a mile from the apple campus , are also important , of course flex added about 2 , 000 jobs for the mac pro desktop but clearly , they are not the only kinds of jobs a tech company can now create
vatican city the roman catholic church will allow priests throughout the world to grant absolution for abortion , the vatican said on monday , making permanent a policy that pope francis announced a year ago in a document marking the conclusion of the churchs yearlong jubilee of mercy , the pope extended a policy of allowing priests and not only bishops or special confessors to grant forgiveness for abortion , which the church considers a sin the announcement was a signal of the popes vision of a more welcoming , merciful and inclusive church while firmly restating his opposition to abortion as a grave sin , since it puts an end to an innocent life , the pope affirmed that there is no sin that gods mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the father the document , an apostolic letter , was signed on sunday after a mass denoting the end of the jubilee year it was made public on monday pope francis decision last year , at the start of the jubilee , followed in the footsteps of pope john paul ii , who granted priests the same right during the previous holy year , in 2000 under canon law , abortion brings automatic excommunication unless the person receiving or performing it confesses and receives absolution abortion is considered a reserved sin , meaning that permission to grant forgiveness usually must come from a bishop bishops could already delegate the authority to grant absolution to parish priests and many bishops in the united states had done so but the practice varied widely by country and even by diocese in parts of the world , observant catholics who have sought absolution for abortions have faced delays at times , or even rejection in some places , priests have been delegated the power to absolve abortions during certain times of year , like lent , archbishop rino fisichella , the president of the pontifical council for promoting new evangelization , said at a news conference at the vatican on monday now that right is extended to all priests , he said , noting that changes would have to be made to canon law to reflect the new practice the decision underscores the popes idea of a church that leaves nobody outside its doors , and the apostolic letter calls on the clergy and the worlds 1 2 billion catholics to reflect , and to act , upon the message at the heart of the yearlong meditation on mercy in the document , a blend of religious teachings and acute social commentary , pope francis delineates the path of the future life of the church so that it can always be an instrument of mercy toward everyone , without ever excluding anyone , archbishop fisichella said the archbishop said that the apostolic letter offered guidelines to priests who were called on to exercise forgiveness , referring to an april proclamation on family life that , among other things , created a path for divorced and remarried catholics to receive holy communion francis letter also noted that the church would celebrate a world day of the poor every november to help communities and each of the baptized to reflect on how poverty is at the very heart of the gospel he also called on the faithful to promote a culture of mercy based on the rediscovery of encounter with others , a culture in which no one looks at another with indifference or turns away from the suffering of our brothers and sisters at a ceremony naming 17 new cardinals on saturday , the pope warned against what he described as a virus of polarization and animosity he said that in gods heart there are no enemies , and chided those who raise walls , build barriers and label people the comments were seen by some vatican observers as a rebuke to calls by president elect donald j trump to build a border wall and to restrict muslims from entering the united states pope francis did not single out any country , but he has expressed dismay over the harsh tone on immigration that mr trump has taken in february , the pope suggested that mr trump was not christian because of the campaign promise to build a wall on the united states mexico border \( mr trump , who is not catholic , called the popes admonishments disgraceful \) the pope on saturday denounced the tendency to treat a stranger , an immigrant or a refugee as the enemy , warning that such thinking invited hatred little by little , our differences turn into symptoms of hostility , threats and violence , he said harassment and violence against immigrants and other marginalized groups surged after election day in the united states , according to the southern poverty law center , which tracks hate crimes and domestic extremist groups
american fashion is emerging from its shellshocked postelection state and is beginning to wrestle with how it is going to handle the advent of donald j trump as the 45th president of the united states and just like everything else affected by the recent vote , a great divide has opened up diane von furstenberg , the chairwoman of the council of fashion designers of america and a very public supporter of hillary clinton , sent a letter to the more than 500 members of the council urging them to consider , how can we help on the eve of this new era \? she suggested that the answer is to embrace diversity , be open minded , be generous and have compassion and to be an example of good nonetheless , last week , sophie theallet , a french designer and self described immigrant to new york who has made a signature out of elegance for all body types and ages , became the first c f d a member to declare publicly that she would not dress melania trump ms theallet posted an open letter on facebook , instagram and twitter explaining her position and inviting fellow designers to join her this got a lot of people very excited and prompted headlines such as designer sophie theallet calls for fashion boycott of melania trump the post with the open letter has been retweeted nearly 8 , 000 times and liked nearly 15 , 000 times on twitter alone and has provoked both cheers and vitriol in the comments , as might be expected but ms trump has not been associated with any of ms theallets looks , and it is unclear whether the soon to be first lady had any intention of asking to wear ms theallets clothes , so it is possible the stand is less dramatic than it first appears as of monday , four days later , no other designer had officially joined ms theallets cause , and she was declining all requests for further comment on her stand and on how it had been received still , it broke the ice humberto leon , half of the design team behind opening ceremony and kenzo \( the other half is carol lim \) , who is not a member of the c f d a , did post a message of encouragement on his facebook page no one should and if she buys your clothes , tell people you dont support it , he wrote of dressing ms trump you know who you are ! \( again , ms trump has not been associated with opening ceremony or with kenzo \) the day after ms theallets letter , fashionista , a fashion website with more than 2 5 million monthly readers , offered an editorial explaining , how we plan on covering \( or not covering \) melania trumps fashion choices we plan on having no part in normalizing the trump family , particularly when it comes to cataloging the first ladys fashion choices , it wrote as individuals , we dont want to contribute to humanizing or making light of an administration that poses such serious threats to women , minorities , immigrants and more , and that has so many other troubling implications that we cant ignore but that we also cant talk about in sufficient depth , because this is first and foremost a site about fashion and beauty we wont go so far as to say well never write about what ms trump is wearing , but were going to reserve it for strictly newsworthy occasions as to what those may be the met gala , state dinners , the usual what they may not be stepping off air force one it will be interesting to see if such public statements of intent continue more common , so far , has been the reaction of another designer , who asked to remain anonymous because he was not ready to take an official position , but who told me that he had been contacted by a member of the trump family who wanted to borrow a dress for a public occasion the designer said that he simply pretended he did not get the message in any case , the conversation is heating up and the stakes are rising one designer , tommy hilfiger , who has an office in trump tower , told wwd this week that he would have no problem dressing the new first lady i think melania is a very beautiful woman , and i think any designer should be proud to dress her , mr hilfiger told wwd personally , i think it makes more sense for everyone involved to take a deep breath and see what happens when president elect trump actually goes to washington it is absolutely fair to ask questions and to watch closely the choices mr and ms trump make about how they use \( or dont use \) what they wear whether they support homegrown industry or , as in the past , brands made overseas what messages they send with their clothes if they are about aspiration \( the reagan model \) , or accessibility \( the carter model \) , or diplomacy \( the obama model \) , or something altogether different \( given the campaign , very possible \) and it is fair to ask whether if american fashion designers want to make a statement it is ultimately better to reject an american president or to try to effect change from within , in whatever way the industry can there will be plenty of time to judge , and plenty of evidence to judge by , when mr trump actually takes office that judgment will start with what is worn to the inauguration , an event that will send a very clear signal about his and his familys intentions when it comes to sartorial semiology whether it will be full
this article is part of the opinion today newsletter you can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox mark lillas much discussed piece in yesterdays times tapped into a debate about identity politics lilla argued that democrats had lost the election by focusing on ethnicity , gender and sexuality rather than appealing to americans as americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of them his view fits with the post election conventional wisdom that democrats must do better appealing to the white working class to regain power i largely agree , but i also think that democrats need to be careful about alienating their current constituencies particularly since many of those constituencies are growing so i spent some time yesterday looking for critiques of lilla , to think through their arguments the core criticism was that lilla was wrong to suggest the political left deserves blame for initiating the focus on racial \( and other \) groups the label of identity politics is mostly ridiculous whenever used , because american politics historically was based on white male identity , vann r newkirk ii of the atlantic wrote on twitter trumps entire candidacy now presidency was based on one of the most effective campaigns of identity politics in history likewise , ira madison iii , at mtv com , wrote trump is confirming racists and white nationalists for his cabinet , but its the liberals focusing on identity politics that are getting us into trouble \? youll find similar points in the comments section of lillas article , including one from sara , one of the first comments under readers picks all of these arguments make a vital historical point this countrys deep racial problems stem from discrimination , not from oversensitivity about discrimination and it would be a terrible mistake for anyone to shy away from criticizing donald trumps alarming choices for attorney general and chief white house strategist at the same time , theres a reality that democrats would be foolish to underestimate this countrys political system the rules for electing both congress and the president is biased toward large , sparsely populated areas those areas tend to be overwhelmingly white unless democrats can win more support from white voters than they did this year , the party will be left to complain about the countrys political situation rather than do something about it
good morning \( want to get california today by email \? sign up \) californias trees are dying at an alarming rate late last week , the u s forest service said an aerial survey revealed that 36 million additional trees had died while in the grip of persistent drought , bringing the total since 2010 to more than 102 million those numbers have startled california officials and scientists while adding urgency to a long simmering debate over what should be done about it the tree deaths have been concentrated in the southern and central sierra nevada , but experts warn of increasing deaths in forests all the way up to the oregon border as a result , forestry officials have asked for more funding to thwart wildfire risks through prescribed burning and the removal of millions of dead trees we must fund wildfire suppression like other natural disasters in the country , tom vilsack , the agriculture secretary , said in a statement but some ecologists say the emphasis on fire danger and its attendant demand for increased logging are misplaced do everything necessary to eliminate risks to humans , these experts argue , but otherwise leave dead trees alone to decompose or go up in flames and create new habitats far from being disasters , wildfires can be an adrenaline shot for biodiversity , they say a lot of the hype seems to me a lack of understanding of the naturalness of disturbance in ecology , said richard hutto , an ecologist at the university of montana the tree die off may ultimately signal a transformation of californias forest ecosystems as a result of climate change , many scientists say in some places , woodlands would simply give way to grasslands max a moritz , a wildfire specialist at the university of california , berkeley , said the focus on wildfire prevention has taken attention away from addressing what that shift is going to mean for california the question is what are we going to do \?

the scenario elected officials promising workers nice pensions based on wishful thinking sound familiar \? it is a problem faced across the united states , and the next victim could be dallas the citys mayor said it appeared to be walking into the fan blades of municipal bankruptcy its pension fund for police officers and firefighters is near collapse and is seeking an immense bailout how can this be when dallas has the fastest economic growth of the 13 largest cities in the country \? panicked local retirees have pulled 220 million from the fund in the last six weeks after a recommendation that they no longer be allowed to take out big blocks of money even before that , there were reports that the funds investments were worth less than stated senator john whitmire , a democrat who has been in the statehouse since 1973 , recalled enthusiastically voting in 1993 for the plan that sent the pension fund on its ill fated quest for investment returns of 9 percent we all know some of the benefits , guaranteed , were just probably never realistic , he said it was good while it lasted , but weve got some serious financial problems because of it heres a puzzle for you 1 europe may never regain economic vigor if italys banks are in a state of perpetual emergency 2 italys banks cannot get healthy without economic growth 3 italys economy cant grow without healthy banks whats the solution \? the countrys banks have muddled through for years , but with the economy so weak , bad loans have festered and good loans have deteriorated nearly a fifth of loans in the system worth nearly 400 billion are classified as troubled by the international monetary fund if this also sounds like a familiar theme , thats because its a longstanding problem and one that affects the rest of europe italys troubled loans represent about 40 percent of all the bad loans within the eurozone but , banking is a symptom , not the cause , says ignazio visco , the governor of the bank of italy he argues that the bulk of italys bad debt is backed by collateral and most of the remainder has a solid chance of turning into collectible debt economists , however , are unconvinced they say banks prop up zombie companies that will never repay their loans , extending just enough credit to keep them current on their debts this years presidential election could be remembered as a pivotal moment for the markets , which have been given the impetus to solidify deeper trends that were already underway a revaluation of a wide range of assets and securities has been taking place but traders are making educated guesses and if they turn out to be wrong , the market could turn upside down again what does this mean for most long term investors \? broad diversification , jeff sommer writes simple balanced portfolios of stocks and bonds have barely moved since the election against the backdrop of the swerves and shifts happening in markets , that may count as an achievement genny lopez , a contractor handling tech support calls for apple the company is unlikely to produce iphones in the united states but it is providing employment for working class americans who lack college degrees the 48 billion mega merger between anthem and cigna goes to trial the justice department is challenging the deal and the drama has been heightened as the companies have accused each other of breaching the merger agreement decisions about this case and the deal between aetna and humana are expected before president elect donald j trump takes office , but his administration could have a major say if either side decided to appeal the decision mario draghi , president of the european central bank , will answer questions at the european parliament he is likely to be asked about the effect of mr trumps presidency on the eurozone
three years ago , i read adventures of huckleberry finn to my daughter she smiled as she heard about hucks mischief , his jokes , his dress up games , but it was his relationship with the runaway slave jim that intrigued her most huck and jim travel together as jim seeks his freedom at times , huck wrestles with his decision to help in the end , tom sawyer concocts an elaborate scheme for jims release when we finished the book , my daughter had a question why didnt tom just tell jim the truth that miss watson had already freed him in her will \? she is not alone in asking scholars have long debated this issue one answer lies in white identity , which needs black identity in order to define itself , and therefore cannot exist without it identity is a vexing word it is racial or sexual or national or religious or all those things at once sometimes it is proudly claimed , other times hidden or denied but the word is almost never applied to whiteness racial identity is taken to be exclusive to people of color when we speak about race , it is in connection with african americans or latinos or asians or native people or some other group that has been designated a minority white is seen as the default , the absence of race in school curriculums , one month is reserved for the study of black history , while the rest of the year is just plain history people will tell you they are fans of black or latin music , but few will claim they love white music this years election has disturbed that silence the president elect earned the votes of a majority of white people while running a campaign that explicitly and consistently appealed to white identity and anxiety at the heart of this anxiety is white peoples increasing awareness that they will become a statistical minority in this country within a generation the paradox is that they have no language to speak about their own identity white is a category that has afforded them an evasion from race , rather than an opportunity to confront it in his campaign for the presidency , donald trump regularly tied americas problems to others immigration must be reformed , he told us , to stop the rapists and drug dealers coming here from mexico terrorism could be stopped by banning muslims from entering the country the big banks would not be held in check by his opponent , whose picture he tweeted alongside a star of david the only people that the president elect never faulted for anything were whites these people he spoke of not as an indistinguishable mass but as a multitude of individuals , victims of a system that was increasingly rigged against them a common refrain in the days after the election was not all his voters are racist but this will not do , because those voters chose a candidate who promised them relief from their problems at the expense of other races they may claim innocence now , but it seems to me that when a leading chapter of the ku klux klan announces plans to hold a victory parade for the president elect , the time for innocence is long past racism is a necessary explanation for what happened on nov 8 , but it is not a sufficient one last february , when the subject of racial identity came up at the democratic primary debate in milwaukee , the moderator gwen ifill surprised many viewers by asking about white voters by the middle of this century , the nation is going to be majority nonwhite , she said our public schools are already there if working class white americans are about to be outnumbered , are already underemployed in many cases , and one study found they are dying sooner , dont they have a reason to be resentful \? hillary clinton said she was concerned about every community , including white communities where we are seeing an increase in alcoholism , addiction , earlier deaths she said she planned to revitalize what she called coal country and explore spending more in communities with persistent generational poverty senator bernie sanders took a different view we can talk about it as a racial issue , he said but it is a general economic issue workers of all races , he said , have been hurt by trade deals like nafta we need to start paying attention to the needs of working families in this country this resonated with me i , too , come from the working class , and from the significant portion of it that is not white neither of my parents went to college still , they managed to put their children through school and buy a home a life that , for many in the working class , is impossible now nine months after that debate , we have found out exactly how much attention we should have been paying such families the same white working class voters who re elected obama four years ago did not cast their ballots for clinton this year these voters suffer from economic disadvantages even as they enjoy racial advantages but it is impossible for them to notice these racial advantages if they live in rural areas where everyone around them is white what they perceive instead is the cruel sense of being forgotten by the political class and condescended to by the cultural one while poor white voters are being scrutinized now , less attention has been paid to voters who are white and rich white voters flocked to trump by a wide margin , and he won a majority of voters who earn more than 50 , 000 a year , despite their relative economic safety a majority of white women chose him , too , even though more
to the editor re even nightmares are classified \( lasting scars series , front page , nov 13 \) your reporting reminds us all of the indelible scars the united states torture program has left on its victims during the obama administration , we in the human rights and medical communities held out hope for transparency and accountability about the appalling treatment of detainees instead , weve had to rely on investigative journalists and detainees themselves to get a full accounting of tortures lasting effects on both body and mind with a trump presidency now on the horizon , theres a real fear that the united states could descend back into the bleak days when medieval , barbarous practices like waterboarding were greenlit at the highest levels of government this spring , donald trump said of waterboarding i love waterboarding i think its great waterboarding and other forms of torture are violations of united states and international law , and are fundamentally at odds with long established international standards as physicians and medical professionals , well be watching closely to see whether or not mr trump carries through on his campaign promises of bringing back torture if so , well be ready to fight him at every step donna mckay executive director physicians for human rights new york to the editor your indictment against the united states government , military medicine and military mental health , and even civilian psychiatry for its lack of oversight , is exquisite at the very least , your expos suggests a new low for the institutional abuse of psychiatry in the united states military the tormented accounts by the psychiatrists and others who expressed feeling torn between prisoner patients , who suspected that the psychiatrists were accomplices in torture , and interrogators , who accused psychiatrists of protecting the prisoner patients , are reminiscent of many of the responses i received from former army psychiatrists in a post vietnam war study those psychiatrists who served after 1968 and after america repudiated the war were typically bitter , disillusioned and deeply regretful because , while by then most were against the war and earnestly sought to reduce psychiatric suffering , their soldier patients nonetheless opposed treatment as if they were agents of a persecuting military it was a rich and troubling example of ethical tensions arising from so called dual agency but this was not the case for the psychiatrists at guantnamo , at least by the standards of the american psychiatric association in 2006 , the a p a officially reiterated its position that psychiatrists primary obligation is to prisoner patients , including serving as their advocate they are furthermore prohibited from participating in or facilitating torture and are obligated to report evidence of torture to those in a position to take corrective action but whats especially suggested by the article is that in being subordinates in the military hierarchy , the psychiatrists in guantnamo were not confident as to how to oppose institutional pressure that they know which side they were on and act accordingly in 1993 , i openly advocated that the a p a actively monitor the regulations , policies and treatment doctrine affecting psychiatrists in the uniformed services , but to no avail the circumstances in guantnamo suggest that this should be seriously reconsidered otherwise , there remains , as was the case in vietnam , an unreasonable burden of conscience borne alone by each psychiatrist who serves norman m camp richmond , va the writer , a retired colonel in the army medical corps , is a clinical professor of psychiatry at the medical college of virginia , virginia commonwealth university
steve bannon , donald trumps chief strategist , is a white supremacist and purveyor of fake news but the other day , in an interview with , um , the hollywood reporter , he sounded for a minute like a progressive economist im the guy pushing a trillion dollar infrastructure plan , he declared with negative interest rates throughout the world , its the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything so is public investment an area in which progressives and the incoming trump administration can find common ground \? some people , including bernie sanders , seem to think so but remember that were dealing with a president elect whose business career is one long trail of broken promises and outright scams someone who just paid 25 million to settle fraud charges against his university given that history , you always have to ask whether hes offering something real or simply engaged in another con job in fact , you should probably assume that its a scam until proven otherwise and we already know enough about his infrastructure plan to suggest , strongly , that its basically fraudulent , that it would enrich a few well connected people at taxpayers expense while doing very little to cure our investment shortfall progressives should not associate themselves with this exercise in crony capitalism to understand whats going on , it may be helpful to start with what we should be doing the federal government can indeed borrow very cheaply meanwhile , we really need to spend money on everything from sewage treatment to transit the indicated course of action , then , is simple borrow at those low , low rates , and use the funds raised to fix what needs fixing but thats not what the trump team is proposing instead , its calling for huge tax credits billions of dollars in checks written to private companies that invest in approved projects , which they would end up owning for example , imagine a private consortium building a toll road for 1 billion under the trump plan , the consortium might borrow 800 million while putting up 200 million in equity but it would get a tax credit of 82 percent of that sum , so that its actual outlays would only be 36 million and any future revenue from tolls would go to the people who put up that 36 million there are three questions you should immediately ask first , why do it this way \? why not just have the government do the spending , the way it did when , for example , we built the interstate highway system \? its not as if the feds are having trouble borrowing and while involving private investors may create less upfront government debt than a more straightforward scheme , the eventual burden on taxpayers will be every bit as high if not higher second , how is this scheme supposed to deal with infrastructure needs that cant be turned into profit centers \? our top priorities should include things like repairing levees and cleaning up hazardous waste wheres the revenue stream \? maybe the government can promise to pay fees in perpetuity , in effect renting the repaired levee or waterworks but that makes it even clearer that were basically engaged in a gratuitous handout to select investors third , what reason do we have to believe that this scheme will generate new investment , as opposed to repackaging things that would have happened anyway \? for example , many cities will have to replace their water systems in the years ahead , one way or another if that replacement takes place under the trump scheme rather than through ordinary government investment , we havent built additional infrastructure , weve just privatized what would have been public assets and the people acquiring those assets will have paid just 18 cents on the dollar , with taxpayers picking up the rest of the tab again , all of this is unnecessary if you want to build infrastructure , build infrastructure its hard to see any reason for a roundabout , indirect method that would offer a few people extremely sweet deals , and would therefore provide both the means and the motive for large scale corruption or maybe i should say , its hard to see any reason for this scheme unless the inevitable corruption is a feature , not a bug now , the trump people could make all my suspicions look foolish by scrapping the private investor , tax credits aspect of their proposal and offering a straightforward program of public investment and if they were to do that , progressives should indeed work with them on that issue but its not going to happen cronyism and self dealing are going to be the central theme of this administration in fact , mr trump is already meeting with foreigners to promote his business interests and people who value their own reputations should take care to avoid any kind of association with the scams ahead
portage , ind i was working the night of the election helping ship merchandise to convenience stores around indiana so i kept up on the news by texting a friend should i worry \? i asked around 10 p m not yet , he said an hour later , the response had changed pressing the worry button now i got off work at midnight , and listened to the radio as i drove home it was by then nov 9 , and the election was coming to an end but it didnt hit me until i saw my mom when i got home , she was awake and watching the television , her face paralyzed by distress i realized we were in trouble i have lived in the united states as long as i can remember , but i am undocumented , mexican by birth my parents came to the united states because my father was in danger he served in the mexican military , but was scapegoated for leaked information and could have been killed my parents decided to leave for california in 1997 , and a year later , my sister and i , ages 5 and 2 , joined them my parents scraped by selling tamales in the streets of los angeles , and my sister and i grew up as californians but there was always a huge difference between us and many of our classmates after my sister graduated , she returned to mexico because she couldnt see a future here , blocked from pursuing higher education and a job her absence has been extremely painful for my family we havent seen her in five years still in high school , i thought i would have to follow her , but the deferred action for childhood arrivals executive order issued by president obama in 2012 changed my life it allowed me to work provisionally in the united states and even qualify for college scholarships most important , i was protected from deportation around the same time , progressive states like california began to implement laws that provided access to higher education and employment i started to dream about stability , about a secure life in the united states but then a gang member threatened my father , and my parents had no choice but to move or risk being killed they left for indiana , where my aunt lives , and she helped them start over again i decided to stay in california where there was more opportunity for undocumented people , so i said goodbye i fell into a routine of working and going to high school i was making enough to make ends meet , thanks to a kind landlord who kept my rent cheap but i couldnt keep my grades up while i was working more than 40 hours a week finally , after four years apart from my family , i joined them in indiana things started looking up i found a well paying job at a convenience store chain and started to attend ivy tech community college , where i became the vice president of the student government i noticed an immense difference because of being closer to my family i was doing better i got my own car and raised my grades to a 3 5 g p a now , with donald trump soon to be president , im uncertain of any protection for what my family has built , let alone for the future of so many families like ours his election legitimizes discrimination against , and the dehumanization of , the entire undocumented community im worried about my work permit i worry about violence and the deportation of my parents and myself i worry that my two younger siblings both u s citizens will be separated from my parents i fear that many conservative states like indiana will push for harsher anti immigrant laws , and that mr trump will nominate supreme court justices who will rule in favor of harsh state laws like those that alabama and arizona passed several years ago although parts of those laws were softened or ruled unconstitutional , they were unprecedented in the power they gave to the police to check immigration status alabamas law even allowed teachers to question students they suspected of being undocumented , and made it a crime to employ , house or even give rides to undocumented people that law was also an economic disaster after it was passed , tens of thousands of people left the state , costing up to 10 8 billion in lost income and tax revenues , according to one university of alabama study farms dried up , construction slowed and investment went down but a republican run house , senate and executive branch , and a supreme court that may soon have a conservative majority , may approve similar anti immigration laws that will make conditions in the united states unbearable for many families i fear that all the hard won progress to create a friendly country for immigrants will be destroyed , and the federal government will forgo any initiatives to establish a path to citizenship undocumented people are not a drag on the united states not only do we contribute billions of dollars in taxes \( and would pay more if we had some sort of legal status \) , we are part of a long history of people who came to this country to seek opportunity through hard work the united states economy needs the work of immigrants it always has i am trying to remain hopeful the next four years will be difficult for many groups not just undocumented immigrants but also women , black and l g b t communities , and muslims we can coalesce around one another progress is made by resisting , and pushing back , by holding on to hope and building resilience immigrants are here to stay so we will
milwaukee four barbers and a firefighter were pondering their future under a trump presidency at the upper cutz barbershop last week we got to figure this out , said cedric fleming , one of the barbers we got a gangster in the chair now , he said , referring to president elect donald j trump they admitted that they could not complain too much only two of them had voted but there were no regrets i dont feel bad , mr fleming said , trimming a mustache milwaukee is tired both of them were terrible they never do anything for us anyway as democrats pick through the wreckage of the campaign , one lesson is clear the election was notable as much for the people who did not show up , as for those who did nationally , about half of eligible voters did not cast ballots wisconsin , a state that hillary clinton had assumed she would win , historically boasts one of the nations highest rates of voter participation this years 68 3 percent turnout was the fifth best among the 50 states but by local standards , it was a disappointment , the lowest turnout in 16 years and those no shows were important mr trump won the state by just 27 , 000 voters milwaukees lowest income neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnout figures of the citys 15 council districts , the decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen in more prosperous areas accounting for half of the overall decline in turnout citywide the biggest drop was here in district 15 , a stretch of fading wooden homes , sandwich shops and fast food restaurants that is 84 percent black in this district , voter turnout declined by 19 5 percent from 2012 figures , according to neil albrecht , executive director of the city of milwaukee election commission it is home to some of milwaukees poorest residents and , according to a 2016 documentary , milwaukee 53206 , has one of the nations highest per capita incarceration rates at upper cutz , a bustling barbershop in a green trimmed wooden house , talk of politics inevitably comes back to one man barack obama mr obamas elections infused many here with a feeling of connection to national politics they had never before experienced but their lives have not gotten appreciably better , and sourness has set in we went to the beach , said maanaan sabir , 38 , owner of the juice kitchen , a brightly painted shop a few blocks down west north avenue , using a metaphor to describe the emotion after mr obamas election and then eight years happened all four barbers had voted for mr obama but only two could muster the enthusiasm to vote this time and even then , it was a sort of protest one wrote in mrs clintons democratic opponent , senator bernie sanders of vermont the other wrote in himself im so numb , said jahn toney , 45 , who had written in mr sanders he said no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black people , including mr obama , whom he voted for twice its like i should have known this would happen were worse off than before but mr obama did do something important he did give black people something to aspire to thats a lot im happy my son was able to see a black president mr fleming , 47 , who has been trimming hair , beards and mustaches for 30 years , had hoped his small business would get easier to run but it hasnt give us loans , or a 401 \( k \) , he said , trimming the mustache of steve stricklin , a firefighter from the neighborhood his biggest issue was health insurance mr fleming lost his coverage after his divorce three years ago and has struggled to find a policy he could afford he finally found one , which starts monday but costs too much at 300 a month aint none of this been working , he said he did not vote mr albrecht , of the election commission , said other factors contributed to the decline in turnout this was the first general election under new state laws that required voters to produce an approved photo id card , and that stiffened the requirements for new voters to prove their residence this was particularly onerous for the poor , who move often mr albrecht said he believed this change had cost several thousand people in the city their vote to me thats very significant , he said it takes away from the fairness and integrity of the election although two federal district courts had ruled that the photo id law discriminated against african americans , who disproportionately lack the approved ids , the law was applied on election day after an appeals court stayed one of the decisions gov scott walker , a republican who backed the laws , has said they have no impact on voter participation , and mr albrecht allowed that their effect on milwaukees turnout would not have erased mr trumps victory in the state perhaps the biggest drags on voter turnout in milwaukee , as in the rest of the country , were the candidates themselves to some , it was like having to choose between broccoli and liver i felt cornered , said ian pfeiffer , 25 , who works the grill at jakes delicatessen and says he did not vote we were stuck between trump and hillary they really left us with no choice mr pfeiffers grandmother , an avid supporter of mrs clinton , spent months trying to convince him to vote for her but he could not get over his revulsion at what he saw as trust issues related to the clinton foundation \( mr
three days after the presidential election , an astute law professor tweeted a picture of three paragraphs , very slightly condensed , from richard rortys achieving our country , published in 1998 it was retweeted thousands of times , generating a run on the book its ranking soared on amazon and by days end it was no longer available \( harvard university press is reprinting the book for the first time since 2010 , a spokeswoman for the publisher said \) its worth rereading those tweeted paragraphs mr rorty , an american pragmatist philosopher , died in 2007 were he still alive , hed likely be deluged with phone calls from strangers , begging him to pick their stocks when achieving our country came out , it received a mixed critical reception writing for this newspaper , the critic christopher lehmann haupt called the book philosophically rigorous but took umbrage at mr rortys warnings about the countrys vulnerability to the charms of a strongman , calling this prophesy a form of intellectual bullying donald j trump enthusiasts might dispute the word strongman but the essence of mr rortys argument holds up surprisingly well where others saw positive trends say , a full throated dawn chorus praising the nations diversity mr rorty saw dead canaries in a coal mine his basic contention is that the left once upon a time believed that our country , for all its flaws , was both perfectible and worth perfecting hope was part of its core philosophy but during the 1960s , shame over vietnam , over the serial humiliation of african americans transformed a good portion of the left , at least the academic left , into a disaffected gang of spectators , rather than agitators for change a formalized despair became its philosophy the system was beyond reform the best one could do was focus on its victims the result was disastrous the alliance between the unions and intellectuals , so vital to passing legislation in the progressive era , broke down in universities , cultural and identity politics replaced the politics of change and economic justice by 1997 , when mr rorty gave three lectures that make up the spine of achieving our country , few of his academic colleagues , he insisted , were talking about reducing poverty at all nobody is setting up a program in unemployed studies , homeless studies , or trailer park studies , he wrote , because the unemployed , the homeless , and the residents of trailer parks are not other in the relevant sense does this overlooked category sound familiar \? mr rorty did not deny that identity politics reduced the suffering of minorities but it just so happened that at the very moment socially accepted sadism good phrase , that was diminishing , economic instability and inequality were increasing , thanks to globalization this world economy will soon be owned by a cosmopolitan upper class which has no more sense of community with any workers anywhere than the great american capitalists of the year 1900 again ring any bells \? this group included intellectuals , by the way , who , he wrote , are ourselves quite well insulated , at least in the short run , from the effects of globalization which left the white working class guy and gal up for grabs open to right wing populists , maybe even strongmen in mr rortys view , no one within academia was thinking creatively about how to relieve white working class anxiety this was a problem outside the academy , he wrote , americans still want to feel patriotic they still want to feel part of a nation which can take control of its destiny and make itself a better place sounds an awful lot like make america great again at the time , mr rorty was staring at a slightly different political landscape but it wasnt that different , ultimately todays just has more mature trees in achieving our country , he wrote about the perils of the north american free trade agreement today , hed probably have cautioned against the trans pacific partnership in achieving our country , mr rorty railed against the scurrilous demagogue pat buchanan , who in 1991 talked about building a fence at the mexican border today mr rorty would have railed against mr trump and his proposed wall why could not the left , he asked , channel the mounting rage of the newly dispossessed \? is his analysis a bit oversimple \? yes even within universities , there have always been optimistic champions of america , those who ever passionately believe in the moral arc bending toward justice and work ever diligently on formulating concrete , actionable policies that would make the country more just by focusing only on his own environment , academia , mr rortys arguments also seem strangely parochial during the 1960s , the academic left may have started to turn its back on poverty , but actual politicians on the left were still thinking a great deal about it robert f kennedy was visiting poor white families in appalachia lyndon b johnson was building the great society right through the 90s and into the 2000s , we had left of center politicians singing the praises of hope , rather than the hopelessness that mr rorty decries bill clinton explicitly campaigned as the man from hope , and barack obama would later campaign on a platform of hope and change in passing health care reform , mr obama genuinely did something for the immiserated underclass , and both men , in their ways , rejected identity politics \( remember mr clinton dressing down sister souljah \? or mr obama declaring on mtv that brothers should pull up their pants \? \) but it wasnt enough , obviously under presidents carter and clinton , mr rorty wrote , the democratic party has survived by distancing itself from the unions and from any
kanye west likened himself to donald j trump at a concert on saturday in california before tumbling into a 17 minute , free associative speech addressing radio programmers , mtv , his friends and collaborators jay z and beyonc , hillary clinton , mark zuckerberg and more after getting an array of grievances off his chest from real world politics to awards show politics mr west ended the performance with a microphone drop , having played only three songs , leaving fans bitter and upset , according to reactions on social media its a new world , hillary clinton , its a new world , mr west said from his floating platform stage above the crowd feelings matter because guess what \? everybody in middle america felt a way and they showed you how they felt the brief concert , at the golden 1 center in sacramento , came two nights after mr west shocked his audience by announcing at a show in san jose , calif , that he had not voted , but would have cast a ballot for mr trump if he had though the rapper affirmed his belief in the importance of issues like black lives matter and womens rights , he praised mr trumps method of communication as very futuristic on saturday night , in a trademark polemic the likes of which had been mostly absent from his current saint pablo tour , mr west doubled down on his embrace of trump like political incorrectness and opined on the state of the media yeah , im taking his lead , mr west said of the president elect a lot of people here tonight felt like they lost , the rapper began you know why \? because yall been lied to google lied to you facebook lied to you radio lied to you turning his focus on the music industry , mr west questioned gatekeepers for promoting songs by drake but not frank ocean , and wondered once again why he is often overlooked at awards shows referring to this years mtv video music awards , mr west pulled back the curtain on what he said was the political behind the scenes dealings that go into booking celebrities for such events beyonc , i was hurt because i heard that you said you wouldnt perform unless you won video of the year over me and over hotline bling , he said sometimes we be playing the politics too much and forget who we are just to win , he continued ive been sitting here to give yall my truth even at the risk of my own life even at the risk of my own success , my own career however , mr west said , such truth telling was necessary for real progress obama couldnt make america great because he couldnt be him to be who he was , he said black men have been slaves obama wasnt allowed to do this the rapper screamed and still win he had to be perfect but being perfect dont always change things when more music failed to follow the impromptu stump speech , disappointed fans turned to social media to demand refunds on sunday , the golden 1 center announced that ticketholders would be paid back in full , including ticketmaster fees on monday , a representative for mr west said that remaining dates on the second leg of the saint pablo tour have been canceled even amid his raw , spontaneous and sometimes rambling monologue , mr west seemed to know he was courting controversy im not always going to say things the perfect way , the right way , he said but im going to say how i feel he added , get ready to have a field day , press get ready , get ready because the shows over
bedminster , n j president elect donald j trump has turned the vital , but normally inscrutable , process of forming a government into a trump branded , made for television spectacle , parading his finalists for top administration positions this weekend before reporters and the world the two days unfolded like a pageant , with the many would be officials striding up the circular driveway at trump national golf club here , meeting mr trump below three glass chandeliers at the entrance and shaking hands while facing the cameras to build suspense , mr trump offered teasing hints about coming announcements i think so , he said about whether he would make any appointments on sunday i think so it could very well happen among the contenders he met with was james n mattis , a hard charging retired marine corps general he appears according to mr trumps own words on twitter to be the leading candidate for defense secretary outside the clubs three story farmhouse on saturday , the president elect poked a finger in general mattiss direction and called him a great man the next morning , at 8 39 , mr trump gushed again , this time on twitter , calling him very impressive and saying he was a true generals general ! perhaps by design , the roster of figures arriving at the club was difficult to pigeonhole there were loyalists \( rudolph w giuliani , the former new york mayor \) , former adversaries \( mitt romney , who once called mr trump a phony \) , democrats \( michelle a rhee , the former schools chief in washington \) and scientists \( patrick soon shiong , a billionaire cancer doctor \) but despite that appearance of diversity , mr trumps choices so far for national security posts seem to show a preference for older white men with similar hard line views on immigration , the military and terrorism most of the leading candidates for other jobs appear to be white men , as well , including mr giuliani , whose own business activities have faced scrutiny if he is nominated as secretary of state , mr giuliani would face questions over his security firms ties to the government of qatar and the speeches he gave to an iranian exile opposition group that until 2012 was on the state departments list of foreign terrorist organizations asked whether he was concerned about mr giulianis business dealings , mr trump said , no , not at all mr trump , as he used his golf resort as the backdrop for his official activities , gave no indication that he was concerned about news reports over the weekend that he had held meetings last week with three indian business partners even as he was starting to assemble his administration the very public process cnn trained a camera on the golf clubs wooden front door throughout the day on sunday has borne few similarities to attempts by mr trumps predecessors to project an image of careful , private vetting of cabinet level hopefuls officials running president obamas transition in late 2008 took pains to keep under wraps his plans to select hillary clinton for secretary of state , and they orchestrated a secret meeting at the firehouse at reagan national airport to discuss keeping robert m gates as defense secretary but for mr trump and his aides , many of whom have long rejected the capitals customs , such traditions are best discarded this has been a year and election cycle where the normal conventions and past history has been challenged , said kevin madden , a republican strategist whose longtime boss , mr romney , discussed the secretary of state post with mr trump why would the transition and the first few months of the administration be any different \? mr madden said trump does things trumps way after each interview , mr trump , dressed in a suit and tie , emerged from the club next to an american flag to see the candidates off to their sport utility vehicles and once again speak with reporters tremendous talent were seeing tremendous talent , mr trump said on saturday people that , as i say , we will make america great again these are really great people these are really , really talented people by the evening , however , mr trump had announced no appointments , leaving reporters waiting on the cold , gusty day to speculate about mr trumps brief comments we made a couple of deals , he said as his weekend of interviews drew to a close mr giuliani is apparently in competition with several others for the secretary of state position , including david h petraeus , the retired four star general who served as mr obamas c i a director before leaving amid revelations that he had provided classified information to a woman with whom he was having an affair mr romney , the 2012 republican presidential nominee and one of mr trumps fiercest critics during the 2016 campaign , met with the president elect on saturday if he becomes secretary of state , he could be a moderating influence on the hard liners mr trump has chosen for attorney general , national security adviser and c i a director i can say that governor romney is under active and serious consideration to serve as secretary of state of the united states , vice president elect mike pence said sunday on cbss face the nation program mr trumps consideration of general mattis , who is widely respected throughout the military , could also signal an effort to ease concerns among members of the washington establishment about the shape of his cabinet general mattis , who led the first marine division during the 2003 invasion of iraq to topple saddam hussein , later commanded american troops during the hard fought battle to retake falluja from sunni insurgents in 2004 but his argument

newark as the two late night comedians sat across from each other onstage at the new jersey performing arts center here on saturday night , stephen colbert asked john oliver why he had not yet been given a commitment for four more seasons theres a clear road that you can put your foot out , said mr colbert , the host of the late show on cbs mr oliver , anchor of hbos last week tonight , replied brightly but fatalistically the kind of road that thelma louise drove off though they didnt spell it out , the two were talking about the victory of president elect donald j trump , who , after a monthslong barrage of jokes from these and other hosts , is about to assume the highest office in the land this live conversation , which was booked several weeks ago and billed with the title wow , that was weird a post election evening with stephen colbert and john oliver , was meant to be a kind of comic catharsis for the hosts and their audience , many of whom expected hillary clinton to win the presidency but the event played more like a group therapy session than what it was , a benefit for the montclair film festival , where mr colberts wife , evelyn , is president of its board the hosts traded jokes about their lives , careers and current events but they did not mince words when it came to their anxiety about mr trumps election , urging audience members not to become complacent in recent days , mr colbert said , there has been a transformation going on in the emotional state of the audience for his program now the story has teeth on a level that it didnt have before , he added mr oliver said soberly , someone whos always acted like the most powerful man in the world has now actually become the most powerful man in the world his show , and mr colberts show , will need to work out what we become next , mr oliver said these alumni of the daily show , comedy centrals long running news satire , find themselves at different places in their professional trajectories mr oliver has enjoyed widespread critical praise for last week tonight , a weekly half hour show that recently won the emmy award for outstanding variety talk series mr colbert , who was largely invincible when he played a fake conservative pundit on the colbert report , is trying to strike the right tone on the late show , an hourlong network talk show that runs five nights a week he is coming off a live election night special , broadcast on showtime , that became increasingly surreal and funereal as the program wore on \( on saturday , mr colbert said little about this special , except to mention that his staff had hired a team of male models , with the slogan im with her painted across their rear ends , in the event that mrs clinton won and then very early on the evening , we were like , you can let those guys go , he said \) mr oliver said that it had not been much fun to write jokes about the brutal presidential campaign usually in his line of work , he said you try and take things of substance and then put some sugar on it to make it palatable but there was so little of substance , this whole campaign , its just like a diabetes inducing amount of sugar your job kind of flips on its head somewhat facetiously , mr oliver , who is a british citizen , talked about whether his frequent comedic jabs at mr trump might mean that he now has to return to his home country im sure he can take a joke , mr oliver said , adding no , we know thats not true , either mr colbert asked him , are you peering out the windows \? mr oliver replied , no , but one day , like jurassic park , maybe ill see the water shifting and go , here they come \( he noted that his wife , who is american , was his legal parachute \) when mr colbert asked how americans could resist the inclination to normalize mr trumps most extreme viewpoints and policies without living perpetually at an adrenaline fever pitch , mr oliver answered that it was dangerous to overlook the pain of people whose lives and routines are going to be shattered not everyone is going to be o k , mr oliver said you have to keep remembering that this is an abnormal version of what weve been through before mr colbert replied i dont have anything to compare it to we havent flirted with strongmen before mr oliver agreed this is a flirtation , he said this is coquettish discussing the apparent rise of websites that traffic in bogus news stories , mr colbert objected to this content being described as fake news referring to his and mr olivers time at the daily show , he said what we did was fake news we got on tv and we said this is all going to be fake were going to make fun of news mr colbert added , the fact that they call this stuff fake news upsets me , because this is just lying mr oliver said that britain was swept up in a similar atmosphere of news media distrust this summer , just before brexit , the vote in favor of withdrawing from the european union when politicians declared that the populace was tired of experts , mr oliver said , people laughed and then they stopped laughing , hard , when the results of the election came in at the end of the evening , the two fielded questions from audience members , like which
washington for years , they have lurked in the webs dark corners , masking themselves with cartoon images and writing screeds about the demise of white culture under ominous pseudonyms but on saturday , in the wake of donald j trumps surprising election victory , hundreds of his extremist supporters converged on the capital to herald a moment of political ascendance that many had thought to be far away in the bowels of the ronald reagan building and international trade center , three blocks from the white house , members of the so called alt right movement gathered for what they had supposed would be an autopsy to plot their grim future under a clinton administration instead , they celebrated the unexpected march of their white nationalist ideas toward the mainstream , portraying mr trumps win as validation that the tide had turned in their fight to preserve white culture its been an awakening , richard b spencer , who is credited with coining the term alt right , said at the gathering on saturday this is what a successful movement looks like the movement has been critical of politicians of all stripes for promoting diversity , immigration and perceived political correctness its critics call it a rebranded version of the ku klux klan , promoting anti semitism , violence and suppression of minorities intellectual leaders of the movement argue that they are merely trying to realize their desire for a white ethno state where they can be left alone mr trump , with his divisive language about immigrants and muslims , has given them hope that these dreams can come true i never thought we would get to this point , any point close to mainstream acceptance or political influence , said matt forney , 28 , of chicago the culture is moving more in my direction emboldened by mr trumps takeover of the republican party , mr forney said he expected people openly associated with the white nationalist movement to run as candidates in the 2018 midterm elections the rise of populism and the decline of political correctness , he said , present a rare opportunity robert taylor , 29 , described the conference as a victory party mr taylor was a committed libertarian , he said , working for ron pauls presidential campaigns and even moving to new hampshire for a project organized by the like minded if hillary clinton had won the election , he said , he would have advocated secession i thought i had all the right answers and had read all the right books , he said i heard about the alt right movement , and it just lit a fire in me mr taylor said that with mr trump , we have breathing room we have a little time mr trump has shrugged off any suggestions that he has connections to the alt right but his hard line views on immigration and his america first foreign policy have captivated members of the movement his appointment as chief strategist of stephen k bannon , who has called breitbart news , the website he long ran , a platform for the alt right , has reinforced the notion that the incoming president is on their side the white nationalist embrace of mr trump was on display saturday at the gathering , which was the annual conference of a group called the national policy institute guests nibbled on chicken piccata while discussing ways to reorient americas demographics many of the attendees , who were mostly white men , wore red make america great again hats t shirts emblazoned with mr trumps face sold quickly while the enthusiasm inside the conference was evident , the resistance to the alt right remains powerful a recent surge in hate crimes and reports of verbal and physical assaults on minorities are putting new pressure on groups that promote racism many sites will not host their events , and some of their members have had their social media accounts suspended in response to vicious trolling of jewish journalists and critics of mr trump a large group of protesters marched around the ronald reagan building , which , as a federal property , could not decline to host the conference these people have their right to freedom of speech , but the values they represent dont represent america , said jon pattee , 48 i characterize them as the shirt and tie arm of the white supremacist nationalist movement republicans who are more mainstream are also unlikely to accept the movements more provocative ideas they have to grow up and start shedding some of their more controversial elements , said erick erickson , a conservative blogger and commentator who has been critical of mr trump i dont think they will ever be accepted wholeheartedly in the republican party nonetheless , alt right leaders said they planned to use their newfound influence to pressure mr trump to take more heretical policy positions , such as a moratorium on net immigration for the next 50 years white europeans , mr spencer said , would be given preference in the long run , people like bannon and trump will be open to the clarity of our ideas , said jared taylor , the founder of the white nationalist publication american renaissance like mr trump , mr spencer , who has become the face of the alt right , derided nato as clumsy and ineffective he called for friendlier relations with the russian president , vladimir v putin , and for the deportation of undocumented immigrants , drawing chants of build that wall i think moving forward the alt right as an intellectual vanguard can complete trump , mr spencer said we can be the ones who are out front , who are thinking about things that he hasnt grasped yet although alt right leaders say they want to become more politically active , it remains unclear how they will react to being more closely
bakersfield , calif sandra eudy has considered leaving for texas tina larson finds it hard to envision retiring here , with the states high taxes eating into her savings and greg surgener would leave , if not for family obligations republicans are something of an endangered species in california , where democrats control both houses of the legislature and all statewide elected offices for the first time since the election of franklin d roosevelt , even orange county , long viewed as the cradle of the republican party in california , voted for hillary clinton but not here surrounded by blue , kern county , a sprawling area at the southern end of the states central valley , stands out as a rare bastion of red a republican island in the countrys most liberal state nearly 55 percent of voters chose donald j trump over mrs clinton in kern , making it among the most solidly republican counties in california were our own state here , ms eudy , 60 , said over a breakfast of sausage and eggs at the 24th street cafe one recent morning ms eudy , the owner of an insulation company in town , said the state gives employees too many rights and leaves business owners without control they think of us as the expendables , she said im sick and tired of being sick and tired but now that we have our own president , maybe things will finally start to change kern county was hardly the only part of the state to vote for mr trump , who won much of the central valley and several less populous counties in the northeast are more strongly republican 73 percent of voters in lassen county chose mr trump , for instance , as did 66 percent in shasta county in the days since the election , republicans here have celebrated , as they have in those other places they have also found themselves hoping that their partys control over the federal government will have a decisive impact on the states policies they have their hearts set on lower taxes and fewer environmental regulations , along with a stronger immigration system that will still let in guest workers for the agricultural fields here with a population of about 375 , 000 , bakersfield is ringed by farms and oil fields , two major engines of the regions economy voters here routinely complain about the ways the states water conservation laws have hurt local farmers , arguing that regulators should do more to send water through californias vast aqueduct system rather than funneling it thought the sacramento delta to protect endangered smelt there for three generations , larry starrhs family has operated a small farm in kern county , which now grows almonds and pistachios he , too , resents the states water regulations for farmers , and hopes mr trump will work with the republican controlled congress to overturn some of the rules and get more water pumped to the central valley theres a huge void and disconnect here between the big cities and the country in this state they look at us as some sort of tumbleweed in between sacramento and los angeles , mr starrh said he pointed to the recent statewide ban on plastic bags as an example of government overreach , something he hopes will lessen with mr trump in power the politicians here think the answer to all your problems is more laws , but i spend more time now going to meetings about regulations than actually farming , mr starrh said it doesnt help me build jobs or feed my family , and its not a way to stay in business republicans make up roughly 38 percent of all registered voters in kern county , while democrats account for 36 percent \( most others are independent \) but republicans control both the bakersfield city council and the countys board of supervisors the city is also home to kevin mccarthy , the house majority leader who has represented the area in congress for a decade many republicans here are confident that mr mccarthy and mr trump will help chip away at some state policies , such as environmental regulations , the affordable care act and the overwhelmingly welcoming attitude toward immigrants mr surgener , 42 , runs a small oil and chemical company and said he hoped mr trump would raise tariffs on oil from outside the country more than that , he said , he hopes for relief on some of the states rules against fracking people in the cities dont have a realistic view of how we make everything out here , he said over drinks at a local bar one recent evening they want cheap oil , but they make it impossible to get it out of the ground they want cheap food , but they dont want the pesticides he has considered selling his business and moving elsewhere , but , recently divorced , he cannot leave his children and , he added , he views the states diversity as a major selling point latinos here account for roughly 45 percent of the population , and many republicans say they have mixed feelings over mr trumps immigration plans while they favor deporting anyone with a criminal record , they are eager to keep those who work in the fields picking crops , arguing that few people are willing to take those jobs jesse rojas , 23 , works in labor relations during the week , but hosts a saturday morning radio call in show in spanish and supported mr trump when the program began more than a year ago at first people wanted to crucify me , he said but i keep saying this is about jobs all anyone wants here is good jobs , and the state makes that harder and harder to do mr rojas said he wants to see welfare programs cut , something
three days after the election , i gathered with a group of historians at princeton for a conference about barack obamas presidency the mood among the scholars , who had just written papers about the underappreciated accomplishments of the obama administration , was bleak we were discussing how quickly his programs would be dismantled , now that republicans controlled the white house and congress donald j trumps stunning election appeared to many to be a direct repudiation of the essential meaning of 2008 , when the country elected its first african american president mr obama was a great policy maker , but not a great party builder in the face of republican intransigence , he still managed to get things done but the strategies that made him successful passing legislation by the narrowest partisan majority , refraining from boasting about what his reforms accomplished and , in the end , falling back on executive orders are exactly what make his legacy so vulnerable congressional democrats frequently complained that the presidents approach put them at risk seeking to expand government with a hidden hand , his policies were designed in such a way that made it hard for democrats to claim credit for them in public , he played down the scale of policies like the stimulus package so that they would not attract too much attention , or criticism whereas president franklin d roosevelt made it clear that every public works project was a product of the new deal , americans usually had no idea what programs came from mr obamas stimulus his programs tended to be extraordinarily complex , dependent on byzantine regulatory mechanisms rather than direct federal intervention , so they would be more palatable to moderates rather than have the government provide health insurance for all , the affordable care act created exchanges and mandates the dodd frank bill did not erect strong regulations to enforce reform on wall street , but rather a web of rules and incentives when he couldnt win support for legislation , for everything from immigration reform to reducing carbon emissions , he relied on executive orders that could and almost certainly will be reversed by his successor now democrats are out of power , and his major policies are on the chopping block the health care exchanges and the individual insurance mandate might be legislated out of existence mr trump is planning to jettison the paris climate change agreement as well as the iran nuclear deal young immigrants will no longer be protected from deportation republicans could use the congressional review act to knock down dozens of rules that were put in place since may , ranging from regulations guaranteeing paid sick leave to people working under federal contracts to consumer protections like the food and drug administrations prohibition on selling antibacterial soaps there wont be enough votes to move forward with the trans pacific partnership agreement mr trumps bluster on foreign policy threatens to reverse the notable improvement in diplomatic relations that took place under mr obama the department of justices efforts to enforce civil rights laws and reform policing will die the slow death of regulatory neglect the balance of power in the supreme court will shift back to the right and policies are not the only things at risk republicans have attacked a basic set of ideas that mr obama tried to promote with stephen k bannon , someone who has long appealed to anti semites and the alt right , serving as the president elects chief strategist , mr trump will double down on his attacks against political correctness and social values like ethnic pluralism and gender equality yet with all of this wreckage looming on the horizon , there is a glimmer of hope that some of mr obamas legacy can be salvaged in american history , there have been a number of elections that seemed to be a repudiation of the previous president , including those of dwight d eisenhower in 1952 , ronald reagan in 1980 and barack obama himself in 2008 but these did not produce the full scale reversal of programs that some observers expected the reason is what political scientists call the process of policy feedback once new policies are put in place , they can generate strong constituencies that will defend them from attack with those taxes in there , no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program , boasted roosevelt , anticipating the dynamics that would make elderly entitlements a third rail in american politics voters come to depend on benefits , politicians are expected to protect them , and interest groups emerge that have a stake in their continuation when this happens , a presidents contributions can outlast the political coalition that created them eisenhower left most of the new deal alone the great society survived the reagan revolution and mr obama failed to wipe away george w bushs counterterrorism program mr trump will encounter strong resistance to revoking the medicaid coverage that 12 million americans now enjoy under obamacare numerous republican governors , including the future vice president , mike pence , pushed for the expansion of the rolls many of mr trumps own supporters probably like the benefits they have received from the a c a , even if they dont realize it even dodd frank , hardly popular on wall street , could survive now that firms have adjusted to deal with the new rules with only a narrow majority in the senate , the g o p will contend with constant obstruction as it tries to gut mr obamas programs on foreign policy , mr trumps tone is far from mr obamas cool demeanor and yet he is unlikely to pull out of nato , and his push to pressure european states into contributing more to their collective defense actually builds on statements that mr obama had been making mr trump is likely to find strong pushback from congress and the public
on the morning of nov 9 , a moderator who goes by the handle ohsnapyougotserved posted on a reddit topic page called the donald how does it feel , centipedes \? the god emperor said that we would get tired of winning are you tired of winning yet \? feel vindicated , centipedes its over and there is nothing they can do about it we are the future within minutes , the post had accrued more than 2 , 000 comments within days , they numbered more than 12 , 000 reddit , a hodgepodge of message boards about everything , from kiteboarding to financial advice to photoshopping human arms onto images of birds , is the eighth most popular online destination in the united states the donald , devoted , of course , to donald j trump , has become one of the most influential communities within one of the most significant websites on the internet yet that post by ohsnapyougotserved is probably largely incomprehensible to most people the donald has around 300 , 000 members some are conservative stalwarts , others are meme making teenagers all are anonymous , hidden behind user names , making their origins and motivations difficult to pinpoint but its fair to say that many saw themselves as political outsiders who reveled in rallying for the underdog the community is home to copious islamophobia , trolling of liberals and near constant bashing of hillary clinton it has evolved a dialect decipherable only to insiders , which includes acronyms like maga \( make america great again \) epithets like god emperor \( for mr trump \) insults like cuck \( short for cuckold and often deployed against feminists \) memes featuring a cartoon frog associated with racism and nicknames like pedes \( centipedes , a term for trump supporters adopted from a youtube mash up of the song centipede by the band knife party and clips of mr trumps speeches it might also be a penis joke seriously \) this , according to its moderators , was the largest , best and closest thing to an official campaign subreddit for donald trump 2016 if barack obamas 2008 online presidential campaign was a well oiled machine that made effective use of supporter data , analytics and social media tools , mr trump owes some degree of his success to an online mob of rabid , self organized supporters politics has always been a popular topic on reddit the site came of age during the administration of george w bush and reddit , in general , despised mr bush it has leaned liberal to libertarian ever since , the most popular candidates being barack obama , bernie sanders and ron paul until the donald when created by a couple of volunteer moderators in 2015 , the community was just one of many straightforward political support pages \( r sandersforpresident and r hillaryclinton were already going strong \) that sprang up to aggregate news articles from sources such as cnn and the hill today the donald is something different its memes and slang serve as the passwords to an internet speakeasy , a secret club whose rules one moderator justified as existing to create a safe space for trump supporters everyone wants to have a sense of belonging , reddits chief executive , steve huffman , told me last week at some point , it becomes almost cultlike the donalds policy states no racism anti semitism , but it also warns no dissenters or s j w s , as in social justice warriors concern trolling , or questioning views expressed on the subreddit , is also banned the community is notoriously difficult to manage its top moderator team has turned over at least four times , according to mr huffman \( this usually happened because the community revolted , as in one instance in which a lead moderator wrote that he believed he could get away with raping undocumented immigrants \) moderators also suspend and bar members more frequently than do moderators of any other section of the site still , by early 2016 , its content so regularly took over reddits most popular lists that the company decided to change its algorithm to make it harder for posts from groups like the donald to reach prominence , according to employees when he announced the change , mr huffman said it had been in the works for a while , but also that reddit was being undermined by the donalds attempts to dominate the conversation the communitys power soon reached beyond reddit mr trump tweeted out memes and videos that originated on the donald and in july he participated in a popular reddit ask me anything discussion , after his team communicated with the moderators this would make little sense if the donald were all memes and derision but according to reddit , the donalds moderators nearly 50 far flung volunteers deftly managed to channel action out of the chaos they hosted an extensive and at times informative wiki about mr trumps policy proposals and instructed supporters how to help with the campaign members often suggested strategies for arguing persuasively against opponents perhaps most important , members organized an effort to comb through the democratic national committee emails released by wikileaks over the summer in order to interpret and disseminate these documents , the donald relied on a network of subscribers it \( adoringly \? \) named weaponized autists of particular fixation were emails from the clinton campaign chairman , john podesta in a debate in october , mr trump said to mrs clinton , john podesta said some horrible things about you there is no way to know how much all this online activism made a difference on election day but there were many discussions of how the donalds hundreds of thousands of members could persuade their friends on facebook and elsewhere to get out to vote and , after all , they spent months discussing
early signs of what the trump administration may look like a man associated with white supremacy and misogyny will be white house chief strategist a man rejected for a judgeship because of alleged racism will be attorney general and an islamophobe who has taken money from moscow will be national security adviser no , this is not satire ive repeatedly noted that my side lost this election , that elections have consequences , and that president elect donald trump should be given a chance he seems intent on blowing that chance the announcement that trump has recruited lt gen michael flynn as national security adviser is particularly alarming flynn is smart and knows the world very well , but he was fired from his last government job for incompetence worse , he today is regarded by many republican and democratic foreign policy specialists as a kook its all complicated flynn had a brilliant military career and did an outstanding job in iraq and afghanistan five years ago , he was widely admired as the best intelligence officer of his generation then president obama nominated flynn to become director of the defense intelligence agency , and he began to unravel he turned out to be a catastrophic manager colin powell , former secretary of state , explained in hacked emails why flynn was fired abusive with staff , didnt listen , worked against policy , bad management powell added that ever since , flynn has been right wing nutty flynn was proved right on one important point his argument that the obama administration was too passive about islamic militants after the killing of osama bin laden but flynns former fans have been bewildered at his raging denunciation of islam , including calling it a cancer in february , flynn also tweeted and asked others to forward a viciously bigoted video that argued that there could be no such thing as islamophobia fearing islam , which wants 80 percent of humanity enslaved or exterminated , is totally rational and hence cannot possibly be called a phobia , the video declares indeed , for an intelligence officer , flynn seems to have trouble distinguishing truth from falsehood earlier this month , he tweeted an obviously fake story claiming that the police had found emails linking hillary clinton to sex crimes with children when he was in government , subordinates had a special name for his delusions flynn facts another problem is flynns ties to foreign governments he took money from russia to attend an event in moscow , sitting near president vladimir putin he also appears to have taken money from turkish interests and , without publicly disclosing the money , wrote an op ed shilling for turkey for his chief of staff , flynn chose his son , who is a looney on social media , calling president obama a communist and fascist , tweeting racially insensitive comments and sharing absurd conspiracy theories the national security adviser not only guides the president on foreign policy but also coordinates across all the agencies that requires a good listener with diplomatic and management skills and flynn is missing that gene the pick of flynn comes on top of other problematic appointments trump offered the job of attorney general to senator jeff sessions , who was rejected for a federal judgeship in 1986 by a republican dominated senate because of a history of racially charged statements for example , he had said that he had thought members of the ku klux klan were o k until i found out they smoked pot \( he explained that he had been joking \) his nomination was only the second in 48 years to be rejected for a judgeship by the senate judiciary committee as attorney general , sessions will be in charge of enforcing civil rights laws then theres steve bannon , the designated white house chief strategist , who at breitbart was at the center of white supremacist , islamophobic misogyny one breitbart headline birth control makes women unattractive and crazy in fairness , trump has also appointed normal conservatives reince priebus as chief of staff and mike pompeo to lead the c i a i dont agree much with either , but both are intelligent and qualified other signals are also troubling , such as a trump surrogate speaking of instituting a registry of muslims and citing the internment of japanese americans in world war ii as a precedent really \? george takei , the actor whose family was interned , wrote eloquently in the washington post about the risks when , in an atmosphere of fear or mistrust , one group is singled out and vilified , as japanese americans were during world war ii and as muslim americans are today how terrible it is to contemplate , once again , that the government itself might once more be the very instrument of terror and division that cannot happen again plenty of smart , experienced republicans are available for trump administration slots but so far , too many are being stiffed eliot cohen is a thoughtful , experienced conservative who worked in the bush administration and , despite his own distaste for trump , had urged others to work for him but after his interactions with a trump transition team that he described as arrogant , he tweeted , changed my recommendation stay away look , trump has been elected , he will be our president and he has the right to choose conservatives but instead of turning to the many principled republicans available , he seems drawn to hotheads and bigots , embarrassing himself and our nation
iowa city the air felt leaden in the hallways at west high school on the morning after election day the usual clatter from the buildings 2 , 000 students was muffled at lunchtime , lujayn hamad was in the cafeteria when she said a boy she barely knew roughly bumped into her and swore at her go back home , he told ms hamad , who is 15 , and an american citizen , and wears a hijab the comment , overheard by a friend at ms hamads side though denied by the male student set off a turbulent week of tears , fury and demonstrations at west high , a large public school in this university town , which prides itself on its openness and progressivism minorities make up nearly 40 percent of the student body at west high , a far more diverse mix than the typical iowan school in the hours and days after ms hamads encounter in the cafeteria , similar incidents followed , students said one girl said she was surrounded by heckling students and called a terrorist another said she saw people chanting trump in the hallways when they passed black students in one classroom , a student noted the absence of a latino classmate and announced to the others , i wonder if she got deported like many other schools around the country since the election , west high has become a microcosm of the united states itself , a place roiled by tension , divisions and mistrust students in many schools say supporters of donald j trump have felt empowered to lash out at minorities , while outraged backers of hillary clinton have been spurred to organize and demonstrate and teachers have been struggling to provide guidance even as they themselves are processing the election results in ladue , mo , a suburb of st louis , students walked out of a high school twice in a week to protest racist comments made at school after the election of mr trump two students were disciplined for telling black students boarding a bus that they should sit in the back swastikas were drawn in a boys bathroom at a middle school in bethesda , md , which has many jewish students children all over the country , particularly latinos and muslims , have fearfully asked teachers and guidance counselors whether they and their families will be deported the southern poverty law center , which has been tracking thousands of such episodes since the election , said the most commonly reported locations for harassment were k 12 schools its impossible to wall schools off from the rest of society , said maureen costello , the director of teaching tolerance , a program of the law center its just seeped into the culture kids are hearing it at home and theyre amplifying it at west high , some teachers and parents have encouraged students to walk out of class to protest racism and sexism and to support a pluralistic society others were livid at the protests , saying the teenagers were overreacting some emailed administrators to ask why some students were allowed to skip class for protests during a crucial finals week a few teachers have responded by hugging crying students and reassuring them that they are loved one assured an emotional student that orchestra class is a safe space where we can all get together and make music , the student said but an english teacher announced , to the dismay of some teenagers in her class , that the election was over and were not going to talk about it everybody seems to agree that the school is a changed place its a different environment now , said jade merriwether , 16 i feel very upset and afraid for my friends people are using the election as an excuse to discriminate against each other openly even trump supporters say they feel under siege two girls walked into the principals office after the election and told him that as conservatives , they did not feel safe walking through the halls , were receiving dirty looks and felt they were not on an equal basis to other students , the principal , gregg shoultz , said mason hanson , 16 , a member of the young republicans club , said he had publicly supported mr trump during the campaign but was upset by the slurs directed at students in the aftermath now other students are angrily blaming him for mr trumps victory he no longer wears his hillary for prison t shirt because he does not want to be lumped in with the people accused of making insulting comments to minorities after hearing about that stuff , i was honestly surprised , he said i hadnt heard it before usually were all polite to each other the trouble began at west high on wednesday morning after election day , when teachers received an email from the principal warning them be objective about the election results and remind students of the schools inclusiveness please be positive and strong and teach the heck out of our kids today , mr shoultz wrote in the email mr trumps victory changed the earth that we stood on a little bit , mr shoultz said in an interview i had a pit in my stomach that day travis henderson , a social studies teacher , arrived at school prepared to talk to his students about democracy and the importance of fidelity to its long and sometimes difficult process i knew it was going to be hard , i knew it was going to take a lot of me , he said i expected tears , i expected fear and i expected confusion in her second period class , carmen gwenigale , a spanish teacher , was faced with three students who were sobbing , distraught over the election results she was sympathetic , but tried to stay focused on the
warsaw europes right wing populists have scrambled to outdo one another in celebrating donald j trump as an american president who shares many of their nationalistic , anti immigrant attitudes less thrilled are the hard liners in poland and the problem is vladimir v putin poland already has one of europes most conservative governments , which took office a year ago and top leaders have eagerly cast mr trumps election as the latest and most crucial chapter in a global shift away from western style liberal democracy but they also see a worrisome problem the chummy noises mr trump has made toward mr putin , the russian president even as the government may share many of mr putins conservative attitudes and nationalist impulses , polish leaders are restrained by a deep , almost visceral distrust of him memories of russian domination during the soviet era are still raw here , and poland has been one of the most hawkish members of the european union on taking a hard line toward mr putin the polish predicament is yet another reminder of how thoroughly the trump victory has scrambled the geopolitics of europe his campaign remarks undercutting nato , and suggesting that the united states could possibly walk away from the trans atlantic alliance , alarmed leaders in the baltics and in poland even after mr trump softened his remarks most of all , poland and the rest of europe will now wait and see whether the victory of mr trump , who apparently has an affinity for mr putin , is an opportunity for europe , or an existential threat prime minister viktor orban of hungary , who had already made friendly gestures toward moscow , sees opportunity many poles still see risks what poland can do is keep increasing its military capabilities , keep a low profile and just wait for putin to show his true colors , said jerzy targalski , a right wing political analyst and historian who supports the governing law and justice party and it wont take too long for now , polish leaders have a dual track strategy to praise mr trumps victory as a continuation of their own victories , focus on areas of agreement with the new american president and play down , as much as possible , disagreements over things like how to deal with moscow polands prime minister , beata szydlo , joined other right wing leaders in declaring mr trumps victory a validation of the rise of a more nationalistic and muscular form of government with a strong executive and resurgent patriotism a certain era in world politics ends , an era when politics focused on elites and dealing with issues of the elites , she said democracy won despite the liberal propaganda but at the same time , polands president , andrzej duda , was quick to add that his country still expected the united states to abide by its nato commitments and to proceed with plans to deploy nato troops , including thousands of americans , this spring along the european unions eastern flank of course , even some members of mr trumps own republican party do not agree on the best way to approach mr putin whether to continue international pressure , as poland wishes , or to seize the moment to develop a closer relationship that ends russias isolation , as poland fears poland and the baltic states , geographically closer to moscow , have insisted on maintaining pressure on thursday , lithuanias parliament voted almost unanimously with just one abstention to maintain economic sanctions as punishment for russias annexation of crimea and aggression in eastern ukraine , for instance on friday , key european leaders , along with president obama , pledged to renew those sanctions but other , more putin friendly leaders have indicated they might agree to end the sanctions presidents who were elected just this month in bulgaria and moldova had talked during their campaigns about doing just that , while political leaders and analysts in poland and elsewhere expect mr trump to move quickly to negotiate a new grand bargain with mr putin they suspect mr putin also wants to move swiftly , not only to end the sanctions that are squeezing his countrys economy but also , perhaps , to head off that planned spring deployment of nato troops polish officials have preferred to express confidence that , despite the troubling signs , the new president in the end will abide by americas nato and european union commitments i think we can be confident that u s policy toward poland and thus also our relations will not deteriorate , that at least they will not become weaker , mr duda said after a brief phone conversation with mr trump this past week and maybe we will be able to strengthen them even further polish leaders have focused on the more welcome statements mr trump has made , like his promise to try to change rules that force poles to get visas to visit the united states , long a sore point and they have steadfastly defended mr trump from criticism in more liberal corners of europe as a result , the right wing government which has chafed under international criticism that its moves to marginalize the countrys constitutional court amounted to an undemocratic attack on the rule of law hopes that mr trumps victory will create an atmosphere in which it can resolve that crisis more to warsaws liking the problem is not that there is a perception that poland is under immediate threat from russia , said marek menkiszak , head of the russian section at the center for eastern studies in warsaw , an independent but government funded research group the problem is rather this uncertainty caused by the mixed signals that have come out of the trump team rudolph w giuliani assured a gathering of polish american voters that the trump administration would abide by its treaty
the supreme courts infamous 1944 japanese internment decision , korematsu v united states , has never been overturned but does that mean , as some of donald j trumps associates have recently implied , that it is still good law , a precedent that could be cited in support of a national registry for muslim immigrants or other morally repugnant classification schemes \? the ultimate answer is no but the no is not a simple one the legal doctrine of stare decisis holds that precedent ordinarily remains in place until it is overturned and cases that seemed outdated and disreputable but remained on the books have sometimes recurred in the courts jurisprudence , particularly after the sept 11 attacks so a moral plea for the government not to treat korematsu as law is not enough fortunately , there is also a legal argument for why korematsu should not be treated as such the most straightforward way to reject korematsu is to understand it not as the definitive word on the true meaning of the constitution , but simply as a moment in historical time in which particular justices applied the law to specific facts according to this view , a decision can be wrong at the very moment it was decided and therefore should not be followed subsequently justice anthony m kennedy adopted a version of this theory of precedent in his opinion in the landmark 2003 gay rights case , lawrence v texas overturning bowers v hardwick , which had held that a state could criminalize homosexual sex , justice kennedy wrote that bowers was not correct when it was decided , and it is not correct today this formulation suggests that it would have been constitutionally wrong in the deepest sense to rely on the bowers decision even before the court realized its error and reversed it is hard to think of an opinion not yet overturned that has a greater claim to having been wrong when decided than korematsu barely six months after the decision , in fact , eugene rostow , a law professor who later become the dean of the yale law school and an under secretary of state in the johnson administration , said as much in an essay titled the japanese american cases a disaster the problems with the decision were both factual and legal on the factual side , the government submitted incomplete and false evidence to the court in claiming military necessity for the internment program , suppressing the fact that allegations of japanese american espionage had been refuted by the f b i and military intelligence and the supreme court had been told that military authorities feared an invasion of the west coast , which they in fact did not the legal problems ran even deeper in his opinion for the court in korematsu , justice hugo black said that it would be easy to rule against the government if the case had involved the imprisonment of a loyal citizen in a concentration camp because of racial prejudice but he improbably insisted that there was no racial discrimination against interned japanese americans because security , not prejudice , motivated the military to order the internments furthermore , the supreme courts deference to executive judgment on the domestic front in order to overcome the equal protection guarantee of the 14th amendment would now be almost unthinkable under current doctrine , a court would have to give such a government action the highest degree of scrutiny to the extent korematsu did not involve this close scrutiny , it has arguably already been overruled sub rosa by the cases that established those scrutiny norms the strongest argument for treating korematsu as viable precedent is that no matter how wrong a judicial decision is , it remains the law of the land until the court reverses it but even this formalist view may be tempered by the legal realist idea that the law may be defined as a prediction of what the courts will do as a predictive matter , the supreme court is extremely unlikely to rely on korematsu it has been widely disparaged by courts and scholars congress repudiated it directly in the civil liberties act of 1988 , which paid reparations to detainees , and in the non detention act of 1971 , which prohibits the detention of citizens without trial when justice stephen g breyer described the korematsu decision in his recent book as discredited , he wasnt going out on a limb , but reflecting a legal consensus admittedly , bad decisions have been resurrected by the supreme court in 2004 , a doubtful world war ii era precedent , ex parte quirin , which involved the detention , trial and execution of german saboteurs , was relied on by the supreme court to justify the detention of unlawful combatants ex parte quirin has now joined the mainstream of legal doctrine despite almost a half century of neglect and a problematic legal pedigree but korematsu is different it has entered what the legal scholar richard primus has called the anti canon , a body of cases that lawyers treat as exemplars of bad legal decision making these are cases like plessy v ferguson , which articulated the separate but equal doctrine even arch conservative justices would have to think long and hard before going against this prevailing view korematsus uniquely bad legal status means its not precedent even though it hasnt been overturned relying on it would be bad constitutional law
last weekend i ate a cricket on national television based on my statistical analysis of presidential polls , i made a bet that if donald j trump won more than 240 electoral college votes , i would chow down like millions of voters in both parties , i was surprised by the outcome as a consolation , id like to learn what went wrong and to figure out how pollsters might do better when they puzzle over our polarized electorate data based websites , from facebook on down , have a responsibility to convey accurate information in this regard , i owe an apology to readers of the princeton election consortium , which i publish my primary purpose was to show people where to put their campaigning energies by revealing which races were on a razors edge i advised my readers to focus on close senate races in states where the presidential race was also close but i also reported an extremely high probability that hillary clinton would win , which was published by the new york times alongside its own model did we lull voters and the news media into a sense of complacency about the election \? in hindsight , it would have been better to express mrs clintons polling margin as equivalent to a 2 2 percentage point lead and that the true margin could be higher or lower by several points that would have better conveyed the races uncertainty poll aggregation is built on the idea that pollsters are more accurate as a group than they are individually during the primaries , i used state polls to argue that mr trump was the strong favorite to win the nomination however , general election polls did less well , and so did i state polls underestimated the republican versus democrat margin by four percentage points , the largest error in decades this presidential level polling error was echoed in the national house popular vote and senate polls , which were also both off by a median of four percentage points as nate silver of fivethirtyeight has pointed out , errors are often correlated a warped ruler is flawed no matter how many measurements are averaged the pattern of polling errors provides a clue to why mr trumps victory came as a surprise in states that mr trump won , his actual margins against mrs clinton were a median of six percentage points better than the last available polls in contrast , in states won by mrs clinton , the gap between polls and outcomes was 0 2 of a percentage point mr trumps hidden strength in the states he won suggests that some fraction of republican voters were struggling between party loyalty and difficulty with accepting mr trump in the end , their loyalty won out leading up to election day , mr trump was kept afloat in polls by a sturdy partisan floor of support of 41 percent to 43 percent with votes still being counted , projections indicate that he will end up winning around 46 5 percent of the final vote mrs clintons support ranged from 45 to 48 points and she will most likely end up with 48 5 percent of the vote this contradicts my pre election assumption that undecided and minor party voters , unusually abundant this year , would not break strongly in either direction the outcome may have also been swayed by the letter that james comey , the director of the f b i , sent to congress on oct 28 about mrs clintons emails , after which national and state polls swung toward mr trump , perhaps decisively i suggest that we retire the concept of the undecided voter based on cognitive science , so called undecided voters might be mentally committed to a choice , but either cant verbalize it or want to keep it to themselves we humans are like this in all kinds of domains , from what to have for lunch to whom to marry indirect approaches like web search data might provide new ways to predict voter behavior in one particularly interesting example , during the republican primary season a reader of my website who goes by the initial n used google correlate , a tool that allowed her to find web search terms that showed the same pattern as state polling data using those search terms , n predicted the outcome in unpolled states more accurately than demographic models of the republican electorate social media may also help gauge voter enthusiasm , especially in midterm elections , when turnout is lower and polls are less accurate unstated preferences can also be revealed by partisan straight ticket voting , which has reached record highs on average , partisan senate and house preferences tracked the presidential race percentage point for percentage point such intense party loyalty provides a way to investigate a preference for mr trump without using the word trump in wisconsin , the democrat russ feingold sought to regain his senate seat from ron johnson mr feingolds lead slipped from a median of nine percentage points in august to a median of one point in october and in the end , mr johnson won this provided a clue that mr trump was strong in rust belt states , where white non college voters are abundant as many have noted , if 55 , 000 trump supporters had instead cast votes for mrs clinton in michigan , wisconsin and pennsylvania , we would be looking at a narrow clinton victory hampered by inadequate data , her campaign grasped the danger to her supremacy in these states too late mrs clinton did not even visit wisconsin after the democratic convention as a scientist , i am committed to learning from my mistakes despite this years failure , data is still our best resource for predicting events , but it is important to get good data in the first place this will be on
today , donald trump as diplomat were not talking about the big stuff , like his ominous national security appointments i know youve had a hard week lets take it easy and just look at his phone calls with heads of state most of them have been taking place in trump tower , although this weekend he decamped to trump national , his resort in new jersey excellent move ! trump national has two golf courses more than all of manhattan , and as far as we know , there are no immediate neighbors trying to chisel the word trump off their apartment buildings plus , if the president elect gets bored , he can always arrange to have chris christie crawl over and keep him company its tough enough for new yorkers to deal with the concept of a trump administration without having it headquartered here traffic is jammed fifth avenue businesses are blocked off and in shell shock never before has it been possible to feel such sympathy for the problems of gucci and tiffany in theory , this should end with the inauguration , but its hard to imagine the first family ever actually moving into the white house dad isnt the kind of guy who would enjoy living in harmony with historic preservationists but about those head of state calls normally the state department would work out a schedule , according to all sorts of diplomatic priorities , but trump seems to just be picking up the phone one of his first conversations was with australian prime minister malcolm turnbull , who got trumps number from golfer greg norman the british were stunned when trump talked with the irish prime minister before he spoke to any of the other european leaders its not clear that he wanted to show favoritism the irish first decision was allegedly at the request of rudy giuliani , and the way things have been going for giuliani , it may have been the most significant thing he gets out of the transition pop quiz when donald trump finally took a call from british prime minister theresa may , he a \) asked her if shed ever played at the trump international golf links in scotland b \) told her if you travel to the u s , you should let me know c \) asked her if shed ever been to new jersey d \) appeared to believe crumpets were a breed of small , fuzzy dogs the answer is b britain may have a special relationship with the united states , but so far trump barely appears to understand weve been dating the 10 minutes devoted to may was less than he spent accepting the good wishes of former celebrity apprentice winner piers morgan the bottom line is that there does not appear to be a plan theres security issues about doing this while sitting in your gilt encrusted living room with your socks up on the ottoman talking on your cellphone , growled norman eisen , the former ambassador to the czech republic and wouldnt you feel better if you thought that trumps first talk with , say , the president of turkey , had been preceded by a briefing \? pop quiz ii when donald trump spoke to the president of turkey , he talked about a \) turkeys rapid and disturbing slide from democracy to dictatorship b \) the war on terror c \) trump towers istanbul d \) golf the answer was probably b , although you can bet trump towers istanbul was in the back of his mind i have a little conflict of interest cause i have a major , major building in istanbul , trump said during the campaign its a tremendously successful job its called trump towers two towers , instead of one , not the usual one , its two two towers , got it trump actually made those comments during an interview with stephen bannon , who was then the awful head of a right wing , misogynist , racist website , not the appointee to a powerful position in the incoming white house this is why were talking about courtesy phone calls today , people its the most cheerful thing weve got trump has also had a lot of visitors , ranging from the owner of the new england patriots to nigel farage , who led the brexit campaign in britain \( once again we are noting that the prime minister is coming in behind everybody really , if may ever does come to visit , shell probably have to see the white house with a tour group \) trump gave an hour to bill de blasio , the very liberal mayor of new york city , which was certainly gracious given the harsh words the two men have exchanged over the last year de blasio said he explained to trump how fearful new yorkers were of his ideas the mayor also said the meeting went great this is good news maybe trump does have an untapped potential for diplomacy tell it to the british meanwhile , i am sorry to report that de blasio didnt suggest trump move to new jersey
of all the disturbing scenes in the presidential campaign , the republican convention speech by retired lt gen michael flynn stood out during a fiery address in which he lamented the decline of american exceptionalism and lambasted the democratic nominee , hillary clinton , general flynn joined the crowd in chants of lock her up ! smiling slyly , he shouted yeah , thats right , lock her up ! it was grotesque , but not entirely surprising for a military intelligence veteran who has earned a reputation for hotheadedness and poor judgment americans of all political backgrounds should be alarmed that general flynn will be president elect donald trumps national security adviser its likely , given his record , that he will encourage mr trumps worst impulses , fuel suspicions of muslims and bring to the job conflicts of interest from his international consulting work the role of national security adviser has grown in power and influence in recent years , with the bush and obama administrations vesting the office with great authority on matters including military operations , nuclear proliferation , diplomacy , foreign aid and responses to global pandemics the job demands a knack for consensus building , the ability to make sense of vast amounts of information and the rigor to present the president with well thought out options to respond to complex challenges general flynn played pivotal roles in military campaigns in iraq and afghanistan while his skills served him well in those environments , when he was tapped to lead the defense intelligence agency , his shortcomings as a manager and strategic thinker soon became glaring his grasp on the truth was so flimsy at times that colleagues began mockingly referring to flynn facts general flynn did not leave quietly after being fired by the obama administration in 2014 he has since created a self serving narrative , maintaining that he was dismissed for raising alarms about the threat posed by islamist extremist groups , which he contends the obama administration coddles he has been extraordinarily incendiary in his characterizations of islam in february , he posted a link to a video on twitter warning about the threat of islam fear of muslims is rational in august , he told the washington post that he agreed with some of mr trumps views about muslims he called islam an ideology and compared it to a cancer that has metastasized general flynns fearmongering only plays into al qaedas narrative that there is a clash of civilizations , representative adam schiff , the ranking member of the house intelligence committee , said , what he has expressed is dangerous and harmful to us in recent months , even while he advised mr trump , general flynn took on questionable consulting work , including speaking at a forum hosted by the state broadcaster russia today , which is infamous for its propaganda and serves as a mouthpiece for president vladimir putin he also runs a consulting firm that has lobbied for a company with connections to turkeys authoritarian president just last week , he wrote an article urging the extradition of a turkish cleric whom the turkish government said was the mastermind of the attempted coup in july a core theme of mr trumps campaign was making america safer with this appointment , he is doing the opposite
marrakesh , morocco diplomats from around the world converged here this week with the plan to put details on last years paris climate accord and move the globe closer to controlling the industrial emissions that are heating the planet instead , with the election of donald j trump and his threat to withdraw the united states from the accord shellshocked negotiators confronted potentially deep fissures developing in the international consensus on climate change on the sidelines of the negotiations , some diplomats turned from talking of rising seas and climbing temperatures toward how to punish the united states if mr trump follows through , possibly with a carbon pollution tax on imports of american made goods a carbon tariff against the united states is an option for us , rodolfo lacy tamayo , mexicos under secretary for environmental policy and planning , said in an interview here he added , we will apply any kind of policy necessary to defend the quality of life for our people , to protect our environment and to protect our industries forcing united states industries to turn to cleaner energy sources with the hammer of an import tariff is not far fetched countries imposing costs on their own industries to control carbon emissions could tell the world trade organization that united states industries are operating under an unfair trade advantage by avoiding any cost for their pollution the tax would be calculated based on the amount of carbon pollution associated with the manufacturing of each product that would impose a painful cost on the heaviest industrial polluters , particularly on exporters of products containing steel and cement the paris agreement is meant to get everyone on board in one structure where you can address climate change together , said dirk forrister , the president and chief executive of the international emissions trading organization , a nonprofit organization that consults with governments and companies but if one big country backs out it could trigger a whole wave of trade responses he added there is no need to start a trade war over climate change but it might happen the marrakesh summit meeting was expected to conclude late friday or early saturday with a declaration that all governments will continue to carry out and strengthen the paris accord , and a timetable for adopting the details of the pact , such as a global system to monitor and verify carbon emission reductions at the national level in washington , the obama administration has pressed forward with its environmental agenda as if mr trump had not been elected an offshore drilling plan unveiled friday assumes continued bans on oil and gas exploration in the atlantic and arctic oceans which the trump administration could easily reverse but diplomats are quietly going off their agendas to begin planning how to react if mr trump chooses to reject the paris agreement the pact , as it stands , contains no enforcement measures , such as economic sanctions , for countries that do not comply but individual governments could put trade sanctions in place on their own or in concert in mexico , which is already preparing for a newly adversarial relationship with an american president who has threatened to build a wall along the border , government officials said they have begun considering the idea of a carbon tariff canada , the united states largest trading partner , is also discussing a tariff some canadian provinces , including ontario and quebec , already have carbon tax policies that include fees imposed on fossil fueled energy generated across provincial borders i see that extending across the canadian border if the u s pulls out of paris , said lisa demarco , a senior partner with demarco , allan , a toronto based climate law firm that advises canadian provinces and international businesses if you want to sell your goods in canada , youd have to meet the same emissions standards , she said in france , nicolas sarkozy , the former french president who is campaigning to hold that office again , suggested this week that the european union impose a carbon tariff on american imports if washington withdraws supporters of mr trumps climate change policies say they are not worried its an empty threat , said thomas j pyle , the president of the institute for energy research , an organization partly funded by the billionaire libertarian brothers charles and david koch and which mr trump has cited as influential in shaping his energy and climate proposals economists widely agree that the most effective way to attack climate change is to tax or otherwise put a price on planet warming pollution most of the worlds major economies , including the european union and china as well as canada and mexico , have already begun to put domestic carbon pricing programs in place the european unions cap and trade system capped carbon pollution levels and created a market for companies to buy and sell permits to pollute china plans to implement a similar program next year and mexico , which already taxes carbon pollution , is on track to put in place its own cap and trade program by 2018 canadas national carbon pricing system , set to go into force by 2019 , allows its provinces to mix cap and trade programs and carbon taxes with congress unwilling to pass either a carbon tax or a cap and trade program , president obama pushed for climate change regulations to limit carbon emissions while encouraging states to create their own cap and trade programs to comply mr trump , who has called climate change a hoax invented by the chinese , campaigned on a promise to dismantle the obama administrations climate rules and put coal miners back to work but since he was elected , he has not commented publicly on his climate plans mr trumps transition team did not respond to a request for comment while some politicians are already
anyone who has spent time with lt gen michael t flynn , president elect donald j trumps choice for national security adviser , knows he is nothing if not blunt , especially when it comes to his near obsessive focus on radical islamic terrorism he has said on twitter that fear of muslims is rational , written that islamic law is spreading in the united states and said that islam itself is more like a political ideology than a religion the united states , he wrote in field of fight , a book about radical islam published in august , is in a world war , but very few americans recognize it general flynn , 57 , a retired military intelligence officer and registered democrat , will be the person mr trump turns to when confronted with a crisis abroad whether it is a renewed bloodletting in ukraine , a russian cyberattack on the united states or a hurricane hitting haiti , the national security adviser is supposed to be a steady hand and honest broker who can provide measured and unbiased guidance to the president about how the united states should respond these are not qualities readily apparent in observing general flynn over the last few years , said representative adam b schiff of california , the top democrat on the house intelligence committee general flynn was once counted among the most respected military officers of his generation he spent 33 years in the army , becoming known as an outspoken and unconventional thinker as he climbed the ranks of military intelligence he seemed to have cemented a stellar reputation during tours overseeing intelligence for special operations troops in iraq and running military intelligence in afghanistan in both wars , he proved unusually good at unraveling terrorist networks but general flynns career unraveled after he was named by president obama to run the defense intelligence agency in 2012 james r clapper jr , the director of national intelligence , fired him after his attempts to change the sprawling agency left subordinates squabbling and his superiors alarmed general flynn , though , has said he was forced out for refusing to toe the administrations line that islamist militants were in retreat , a position that was in fact correct in his speeches and writing since his retirement , general flynn has veered far from the mainstream in his views of islam , and has insisted that islamist militants pose a threat to the very existence of the united states in mr trump , general flynn found someone eager to hear his opinions he backed mr trumps campaign early and loudly , and the two appeared to reinforce each others views mr flynn railed at a washington elite that he saw as too cowardly to call the enemy by the name radical islamic terrorism he continued to make comments that crossed the line into outright islamophobia and he led the raucous lock her up taunts of hillary clinton , drawing the ire of former colleagues in the military , most of whom see it as their duty to stay out of politics even in retirement general flynn has made few public statements since the election but in an interview in october , he bristled at the criticism , saying he got involved in the trump campaign out of the same patriotic duty that led him to join the military the two men have much in common there is a shared fondness for twitter , and they both see themselves as outsiders whose successes have never earned them the respect of the elite for mr trump , it is the kid from queens versus the swells from manhattan for mr flynn , it is the armys reserve officer training program at the university of rhode island , his alma mater , versus the overachievers from west point he was one of nine children from an irish catholic family from rhode island definitely lower middle class , he said in the interview his father was an enlisted soldier who , after retiring , worked his way up from bank teller to vice president of the bank his mother earned a law degree at age 69 his brother charlie is currently a major general in the army among the hard line republicans who now dominate the party , mr flynn has become something of a cult figure for what is seen as his brave stand against the obama administrations perfidy the favorable view of mr flynn is not shared by many in the republican national security establishment , most of whom opposed mr trump , or many current and former military officers they say he lacks the temperament and broader worldview needed at the white house , where he will have to contend with more than just islamist militants they also fear general flynns apparent willingness to work with president vladimir v putin of russia , who he has said should be courted as an ally in the fight against islamist militants last year , he even sat next to mr putin at a lavish anniversary dinner hosted by russia today , a television network funded by the kremlin , which also paid general flynn to speak then there is general flynns habit of saying things that are simply not accurate with complete conviction \( exhibit a islamic law spreading in the united states \) at the defense intelligence agency , his subordinates called them flynn facts there are also concerns that the consulting firm he founded after leaving the military , the flynn intel group , poses potential conflicts of interest the firm has business ties to middle eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the turkish government representative elijah e cummings , democrat of maryland , released a letter on friday that he had sent to vice president elect mike pence seeking more information about general flynns apparent conflicts , and questioning why he has been allowed to sit in on
something is deeply wrong when the popes voice , reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as a fantasy news site to claim that he has endorsed a presidential candidate , and then be amplified , unchallenged , through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright lies , because they are indefensible , easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people who , when asked , might call their work satire , or admit that theyre in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be shunned , and that facebook is equipped , and maybe willing , to deal with for many people , and especially opponents of president elect donald j trump , the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small relief , the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president obama talked passionately about it on thursday it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an explanation , but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every story , and source , is at risk of being discredited , not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on fly by night websites were prevalent in this election so , too , were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright falsehoods , newslike image memes posted by individuals and shared by millions , and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan facebook page operators for a magazine article this year , it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional fabrication , it contained much , much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a story , posted on a pro trump website and promoted on a pro trump facebook page and , incidentally , copied from another pro trump site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on khizr khan , the father of a slain american soldier , who had spoken out against donald j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and horrifying the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a new , sinister one its insinuating mention of muslim martyrs , in proximity to mentions of mr khans son , and its misleading and strategic mention of shariah law , amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this election , clearly designed to function well within facebooks economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of fake news stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up fake news as a broad media offensive position , especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of mr trumps supporters , and by the candidate himself as the campaign progressed , criticism of mr trump was instantly projected back at his opponent , or at the critics themselves no puppet no puppet youre the puppet this tactic was used on the language of social justice , which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed nihilistically , in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained anti racists were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new tactic , but it was newly effective it didnt matter that its targets knew that it was a bad faith maneuver , a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called foul , but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they could , but realized that nobody could make them listen fake news as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news narrative , as widely understood and deployed , has already begun to encompass not just falsified , fabricated stories , but a wider swath of traditional media on facebook and elsewhere fox news \? fake news mr trumps misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in america \? fake news the entirety of hyperpartisan facebook \? fake news this wide formulation of fake news will be applied back to the traditional news media , which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things true , even when they are facebook may try to address the narrow version of the problem , the clearly fabricated posts facebook has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use one , to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside facebook anyway another narrow response from facebook could be to assert editorial control over external forces facebook tried this , to a very limited extent , with trending topics members of the companys editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news stories , accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a story , upon reaching some high threshold of shares , or a source , upon reaching some cumulative audience , could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble facebooks short lived
washington president elect donald j trumps trio of hard line selections on friday served notice that he intends not only to reverse eight years of liberal domestic policies but also to overturn decades of bipartisan consensus on the united states proper role in world affairs mr trump is moving quickly to realize his campaigns promise of a nation that relentlessly enforces immigration and drug laws views muslims with deep suspicion second guesses post world war ii alliances and sends suspected terrorists to guantnamo bay or c i a secret prisons to be interrogated with methods that have been banned as torture at a time when american cities have been inflamed by racial tensions , police shootings and fears over homegrown terrorism , mr trump made no conciliatory gestures toward muslims , mexicans or residents of african american neighborhoods , all of whom he disparaged during his campaign in his first major national security selections so far senator jeff sessions , republican of alabama , for attorney general representative mike pompeo , republican of kansas , for c i a director and lt gen michael t flynn for national security adviser mr trump sent a clear message that he does not intend to use these personnel choices to build bridges to democrats or the moderate and traditionally conservative republicans who opposed the nationalist overtones of his presidential campaign the reaction from democrats was swift and sulfurous senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts demanded that mr trump withdraw mr sessions , while senator cory booker of new jersey charged that some of mr trumps choices had degraded and demeaned americans the president elect has created a white house leadership that embodies the most divisive rhetoric of his campaign , senator ron wyden of oregon said mr trump swept into office promising to dispense with the political correctness of washingtons establishment , and his choices reflect that president george w bush assembled a republican cabinet with a variety of shades of conservative ideology , including some members who challenged the president mr trumps early decisions suggest he favors a cabinet that will echo his opinions the choices also suggest that on the perennially vexing question of how the government should balance security and civil liberties , mr trump will throw his weight firmly behind security , in matters of both counterterrorism and traditional law enforcement mr sessions , one of the senates most conservative members , defended mr bushs authority to conduct wiretapping without a warrant after the sept 11 attacks he has been a vocal supporter of military detention at guantnamo bay and sharply criticized the obama administration for assigning lawyers to suspected terrorists and giving them the right to remain silent , even when arrested on american soil he has said the united states should keep waterboarding a banned technique that the obama administration considered to be torture as an interrogation option because it works a former prosecutor with a history of racially tinged remarks , mr sessions has voted against laws that protect gay people and guarantee equal pay for women he has also supported efforts to roll back the voting rights act he has shown over two decades in the senate that he believes the justice department should do more to crack down on illegal immigration and he has supported strict enforcement of drug laws and opposed the dtente that washington reached with states that legalized marijuana while the obama administration has used the justice department to expand the definition of civil rights to cover gays , lesbians and transgender people , for example mr sessions says the government should not be a sword to assert inappropriate claims that have the effect of promoting political agendas jeff sessions has a decades long record from his early days as a prosecutor to his present role as a senator of opposing civil rights and equality , sherrilyn ifill , the president and director counsel of the n a a c p s legal defense fund , said in a statement it is unimaginable that he could be entrusted to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for this nations civil rights laws as one of mr trumps earliest , most vocal supporters , mr sessions has supported mr trumps call for a temporary ban on immigration from muslim countries as the nations chief law enforcement officer , mr sessions would be in position to help put that ban into effect we have no duty to morally or legally admit people , he said this year we need to use common sense with the who what where of the threat it is the toxic ideology of islam along with mr pompeo and general flynn , he will thrust the charged phrase radical islamic terrorism to the center of american foreign policy in a way that blurs the lines between a war on terrorism and a war on islam general flynn , in particular , has used anti muslim language that even the most strident republicans have avoided fear of muslims is rational , he posted on twitter in february he has described islam as a political ideology that has turned into a malignant cancer like mr sessions , general flynn favors an immigration ban and has expressed support for the idea of forcing muslims in the united states to register with the government he once erroneously wrote on twitter that shariah , or islamic law , was in danger of taking over the country both mr bush and president obama believed that such assertions inflamed anti american sentiment , served as a recruiting tool for terrorists and antagonized countries in the middle east that the united states needed as allies in the fight against violent extremism since sept 11 , 2001 , there has been bipartisan consensus that the best way to combat terrorism was to dismantle al qaeda and other networks while avoiding being seen as attacking islam mr trump has shown no such qualms mr pompeo has said muslim leaders contribute
to the editor reports that president elect donald trump 1 \) will not place his assets in a true blind trust 2 \) intends that his adult children will manage his businesses , as well as advise his administration and 3 \) still refuses to give a true accounting of his finances , including his tax returns , have laid the foundation for an early implosion of his presidency the custom of transparency that should guide the presidents financial disclosures is as much for his own protection as for our information it offers him a presumption of good faith , especially when used in conjunction with the tradition of shielding his assets in a blind trust by flouting these protections , mr trump is opening himself to an unending stream of accusations of self dealing and conflicts of interest it is true that a supportive congress will probably not be launching the sort of investigations that it regularly unleashed on the obama administration but we still have an independent press , which i trust will be vigilant thomas higgins oakland , calif the writer was deputy secretary to the cabinet for president jimmy carter to the editor re mr trumps tangled web \( editorial , nov 17 \) i agree wholeheartedly with your editorial about the many conflicts raised by a president like donald trump and his extensive business and family network aside from nepotism issues , doesnt the involvement of his children and son in law , even as informal advisers , allow for his family to trade on inside , confidential or secret information to their financial benefit \? how can we ever know what they learn , and how they act to benefit or protect themselves \? we have strict rules about this sort of insider trading when it comes to businesses and stock trading but how will we know if the trumps are not exploiting their insider information to enrich or insulate themselves \? just asking kenneth lerner portland , ore to the editor many americans are concerned that the trump presidency not directly benefit the trump brand in an effort to allay fears , ivanka trump vows that her family plans to work hard to avoid any conflict of interest that would issue from their fathers political position days later ivanka appears on 60 minutes sporting a stunning diamond bracelet a piece from her own line the following day her company advertises that this bracelet can be purchased for the sum of 10 , 000 what is wrong with this picture \? richard tuch los angeles
last week , our first friday mailbag was mostly election themed , with donald trumps surprise victory occupying most readers minds this week has been no different the number of letters only increased over the weekend and during the first half of the week , coming in at their highest rate at around 500 per day many readers were still questioning the timess election coverage more on that in sundays public editor column another related topic was the papers plans to cover the trump presidency over the next four years some offered suggestions several other writers proposed methods for responding to a president whose falsehoods , thus far , have been difficult to keep up with others offered words of encouragement in response to the president elects barrage of angry tweets about the times one reader wrote when the times reported on trumps first white house appointees , many readers believed that the paper was already normalizing trumps presidency by inaccurately describing them on the timess description of trumps pick to reshape the environmental protection agency , myron ebell , as a climate contrarian \( a memo that went out to times editors last year advised that the paper should not use the shorthand climate skeptics except when referring to the \( relatively few \) trained scientists who see only moderate consequences in global warming other doubters political , religious , whatever need a more deliberate description , like people who reject established climate science or , subsequently , climate denialists or climate contrarians \) on the timess description of trumps pick for a top white house post , stephen bannon , as a right wing media provocateur and a nationalist media mogul some readers were mystified by the timess postelection analysis several were concerned with a story that featured a map describing two separate americas one hillary clintons , one trumps a story on the trump camps refusal to close the door on putting hillary clinton in jail raised readers eyebrows when it compared trumps possible investigation to president obamas decision over whether to investigate the george w bush administration for torture the sentence has since been updated , though readers were not notified the earlier sentence read the decision trump faces echoes one confronted by mr obama and his first attorney general , eric h holder jr , over whether to investigate bush administration officials for extreme interrogation tactics against terrorism suspects that the obama administration later deemed to be torture it was changed to when mr obama took office , he and his first attorney general , eric h holder jr , also faced a decision over whether to investigate the previous administration one reader wrote the public editors take the editors were wise to rethink their apples to watermelons comparison equating clintons email travails to the actions of c i a water boarders just doesnt hold up after a times live briefing included the term death tax , a slew of readers wrote in to point out the misstep one reader wrote we raised the concern with the editor of the briefing he told us that the term had slipped by , and that hed discuss it with the author \( the term still remains in the briefing at time of publication \) notwithstanding the various complaints and trumps claim otherwise the times this week reported a drastic uptick in paid subscriptions since the election 41 , 000 , to be exact many of the new subscribers wrote in to our office to explain their decisions one reader even asked how he could go a step further another reader said she would will be relying on the times not just for its reporting but also for inspiration although we cant speak for the newsroom , we can promise beth that the public editors office will do its best to help the newsroom answer the call
the stock markets turbulent response to the election of donald j trump first down , then up presents an interesting quandary was the election result good or bad for investors \? right now , it appears that they have made peace with the prospect of a trump presidency the s p 500 a broad based index of stocks closed last week 1 5 percent higher than its election eve level but this is a striking reversal from the initial judgment throughout the campaign , stocks rose whenever campaign developments made it less likely that mr trump would be elected consider the four events that shifted the race most dramatically stocks rose sharply after the first presidential debate , one that most people thought mr trump lost stocks rose again after the release of the video of mr trumps sexually explicit boasts when the f b i announced that it was looking into a new cache of hillary clintons emails , mr trumps electoral stock rose , but american stocks fell and when the f b i clarified that there nothing new in these emails , stocks rose on the increased prospect of a trump loss each of these market responses suggests that investors believed that stocks would be worth much less under president trump i documented this pattern in a pre election column , and also in a research paper in which eric zitzewitz , a dartmouth economist , and i studied these data more carefully we concluded that the market was acting as if it were pricing in a substantial trump discount perhaps as large as 12 percent if this was right , then a surprise trump win should have led stocks to fall , and fall sharply just how sharply depends how much markets had already priced in the possibility of a trump win , and our best guess was that it would lead stocks to fall by 8 to 10 percent markets followed that script at least at first as the votes were tallied through the evening , it became clear that mr trump was on track to win the election by midnight , the upshots live forecast gave him a better than 95 percent chance of winning , as did traders in political prediction markets as predicted , traders in overnight markets responded savagely , and stocks plummeted when the decline in s p 500 futures hit 5 percent , it triggered the circuit breakers at the chicago mercantile exchange foreign stock indexes were also cratering while markets had yet to fall by as much as we had predicted , they appeared to be on their way but then an unexpected second act began the futures market reopened , and traders who by now had had some time to digest the reality of a trump presidency reversed course over the next four hours , stock futures recovered around two thirds of their earlier losses by the time major markets in the united states opened the next morning for regular trading , stocks were almost back to pre election levels stocks rose again on each of the following two days what explains this roller coaster \? some commentators have suggested that markets rallied in response to mr trumps relatively conventional victory speech his emphasis on infrastructure spending , in particular , might have boosted near term growth expectations but the speech began just before 3 a m , three hours after the market turnaround the speech was simply a rehashing of mr trumps previously announced policies a major infrastructure push might be good for stocks , but its hard to believe that what was said at 3 a m changed the odds of its implementation moreover , the size of the stimulus which would most likely be partly countered by a fed tightening is not large enough to explain a major market movement another possibility is that markets were responding to news that republicans looked likely to hold the house and senate but according to the upshots live forecast , that was clearly a sure thing by 10 p m , while the market turnaround occurred hours later others have suggested that the market rallied because the election reduced uncertainty , and markets hate uncertainty but this is a case where our casual intuitions can be misleading the election did resolve one uncertainty , but in a way that increased overall uncertainty the markets went from facing the mere possibility that the riskier candidate would be elected , to the certainty that he would be that is , risk and uncertainty rose , which typically leads stock prices to fall perhaps markets were responding to some other source of good news about the economy \? ive scoured news feeds from election night for other events that might have moved markets , and cant find anything when conventional explanations fail , its time to look for something more unorthodox mr zitzewitz thinks what happened is analogous to polling error overnight futures markets are populated by a relatively small number of traders who are attempting to predict how the broader market will respond the next day just as polling errors arise when pollsters survey more democrats or republicans than there are in the broader population , overnight markets can send faulty signals when they reflect more bears or bulls than the broader market in his telling , the market turnaround really gathered steam when the european financial markets opened for regular trading at around 2 a m \( eastern time \) and it continued with greater force as more of the worlds traders awoke to discover that mr trump had won and stocks were cheap its a story suggesting that its worth listening to the signals from overnight markets , because they get it right on average but it also suggests interpreting signals with greater caution than we showed , because theyre an imperfect gauge of broader market sentiment my own view is that last weeks stock market gyrations
to the editor the medicare killers , by paul krugman \( column , nov 18 \) , tells the truth about the likely effort by donald trump and paul ryan to turn back the clock on medicare and give it away to the private insurance industry a good deal for insurance companies , but a very bad deal for the 55 million older and disabled people who rely on medicare as mr krugman writes , this is not necessary its just the latest ploy to privatize medicare and diminish the program for generations to come judith stein executive director center for medicare advocacy mansfield , conn
jerusalem americas top diplomat in jerusalem lives in an elegant three story stone house first built by a german lutheran missionary in 1868 , a short walk from the historic old city but he is not an ambassador and the mission is a consulate , not an embassy for decades , those distinctions have rankled many israeli jews the united states , along with the rest of the world , has kept its primary diplomatic footprint not in israels self declared capital , jerusalem , but in the commercial and cultural hub of tel aviv to avoid seeming to take sides in the fraught and never ending argument over who really has the right to control this ancient city until now maybe president elect donald j trump vowed during his campaign that he would relocate the mission fairly quickly after taking office that in itself is nothing new for years , candidates running for president have promised to move the embassy to jerusalem , and for years , candidates who actually became president have opted against doing so but just as mr trump broke all the rules of campaigning , some of his supporters say no amount of hand wringing by the state department will change his mind jason greenblatt , an orthodox lawyer who is advising mr trump on israel , told army radio after the election that the president elect was going to do it because he was a man who keeps his word already , many israelis and palestinians are buzzing about the prospect where would the embassy go \? would it straddle the line between west jerusalem , which is predominantly jewish , and east jerusalem , which is predominantly arab \? would it touch off street protests in palestinian cities or a backlash among arab allies like egypt and saudi arabia \? jerusalem is a symbolic , emotional and real issue , said itamar rabinovich , a former israeli ambassador to the united states and president of the israel institute it matters to many israeli jews because it would indicate that the united states actually recognizes jerusalem as israels capital , which now it effectively does not which is why arabs object so strenuously to such a move this is a sign that hes going to side with israel , said mustafa alani , a scholar at the gulf research center , a research organization with offices in saudi arabia and elsewhere if he does it , its going to be a wrong start for his relationship with the arab world the status of jerusalem has always been one of the thorniest issues dividing jews and arabs in 1947 , the united nations recommended that the city be declared a corpus separatum , meaning an international city , rather than incorporated into either the arab or the jewish states then being contemplated on the land between the jordan river and the mediterranean sea but in the war that followed its declaration of statehood in 1948 , israel captured the western portion of the city while jordan seized the east israel took control of east jerusalem in its 1967 war with its arab neighbors and annexed it , declaring that the city would remain whole and unified as its eternal capital \( and later building many settlements there that most of the world considers illegal \) the united states and most other countries refused to recognize the annexation and kept their embassies in or near tel aviv the last two countries with embassies in jerusalem , costa rica and el salvador , moved out a decade ago bill clinton and george w bush both promised during their presidential campaigns to move the embassy to jerusalem both later backed away from those promises , convinced by middle east experts that doing so would prejudge negotiations for a final settlement between israelis and palestinians in 1995 , congress passed a law declaring jerusalem to be israels capital and requiring the embassy be moved there by 1999 or else the state department building budget would be cut in half but the law included a provision allowing presidents to waive its requirement for six months if they determined it was in the national interest so every six months , mr clinton , mr bush and eventually president obama signed such waivers , fearing a violent response in the arab world if the embassy moved every president who reversed his campaign promise did so because he decided not to take the risk , said dennis b ross , a longtime middle east envoy who advised multiple presidents , including mr obama jerusalem has historically been an issue that provoked great passions often as a result of false claims that did trigger violence whether such advice might sway mr trump is unclear despite mr greenblatts declaration , another trump adviser on the middle east , walid phares , told the bbc that mr trump would move the embassy under consensus he later clarified that he meant a consensus at home , since no one could imagine a consensus including arabs at this point elliott abrams , a former middle east adviser to mr bush , said mr trump should follow through because even if east jerusalem is eventually ceded to the palestinians as the capital of their own state , no plausible settlement would deny west jerusalem to israel there is simply no reason not to put a u s embassy there , he said the issue remains so delicate that the obama administration went all the way to the supreme court to block a law passed by congress allowing american parents of children born in jerusalem to list israel as their birthplace on their passports when mr obama came to jerusalem in september for the funeral of shimon peres , the former israeli president and prime minister , the white house initially released a transcript of his eulogy that listed jerusalem , israel as the location of his remarks a few
san francisco this is going to sound very california , but here goes i drowned my election sorrows by surfing it didnt help , but i was struck by something afterward all my life , ive seen strangers on california beaches bearded bodysurfers drinking local bourbon , republican volleyball players eating vegan energy bars trade warm glances that say , i salute your lifestyle choices and respect your privacy after the election , those furtive nods implied nausea , terror and a compassion born of confidence that others felt much the same within that compassion , i sensed the emergence of something new in california public life an awareness that we californians are bound together as one people by the shared values of our increasingly tolerant and pluralistic society everybody knows by now that california tacked left on election day 61 5 percent of our voters choose hillary clinton for president we made kamala harris the first indian american \( and second african american woman \) to be elected a united states senator we reaffirmed overwhelming democratic majorities in state politics and we voted to legalize marijuana , ease parole for nonviolent criminals , raise taxes on cigarettes , extend income tax increases on the wealthiest few , boost school spending , restore bilingual education , encourage the reversal of the supreme courts noxious citizens united ruling and ban single use plastic bags the national outcome made our progressivism feel so threatened and precious that a pre election video of gov jerry brown saying , were going to have to build a wall around california to defend ourselves from the rest of this country went viral he was joking , but the mental image helped us all see in physical terms pacific on one side , sierra nevada on the other what has become obvious in cultural terms namely , that california is now both a place and a body politic apart secession goes by different names calexit , califrexit and there is a group called yes california that aims to put an exit referendum on the 2019 ballot for all the obvious reasons california , for example , pays many billions of dollars more in taxes annually than it gets back in federal spending and has every year since 1987 , despite our own crumbling infrastructure and underfunded public schools then theres our relative impotence in shaping the federal government , given an electoral college that makes one vote for president in wyoming worth more than three in california , and the fact that wyoming gets one united states senator for every 291 , 000 people , roughly speaking , while california gets one for every 19 2 million each of californias 53 congressmen have to represent over a hundred thousand people more than cynthia lummis , a republican who is wyomings lone representative on election day , shervin pishevar , the multimillionaire uber investor and hyperloop one co founder , promised to bankroll a campaign for california to become its own nation if mr trump won he moderated that position a week later with a tweet that advocated a new federalism where state and local governments are empowered to determine their destinies while bonded together in a united states of america still , nearly everyone i know would vote yes tomorrow if we could secede peacefully and get security guarantees while we annex oregon and washington , join the canadian health care system and claim brooklyn in the same way that west germany once claimed west berlin secession has virtually zero chance of success , which is doubtless one reason that retiring senator barbara boxer just introduced an equally hopeless bill to change the electoral college but caleavefornia talk does reflect sincere frustration at being overtaxed and underrepresented in a country that suddenly seems unenthusiastic about our way of life californian officials have begun channeling that public mood into bracing us against them rhetoric the los angeles chief of police , charlie beck , has declared that his officers will take no part in deporting undocumented immigrants governor brown promised to protect the precious rights of our people and continue to confront the existential threat of our time devastating climate change senator elect harris conceded that most californians are feeling dispirited and said , you are not alone , you matter and weve got your back then there is the joint statement released on nov 9 by the state senate leader , kevin de len , and assembly speaker , anthony rendon today , we woke up feeling like strangers in a foreign land , because yesterday americans expressed their views on a pluralistic and democratic society that are clearly inconsistent with the values of the people of california we have never been more proud to be californians by a margin in the millions , californians overwhelmingly rejected politics fueled by resentment , bigotry and misogyny they went on to call california a refuge of justice and opportunity for people of all walks , talks , ages and aspirations regardless of how you look , where you live , what language you speak , or who you love , and promised that , as they put it , we will not be dragged back into the past this last bit matters because californias past is not pretty the genocide of indigenous californians was remarkable among north american indian wars for its sheer scale and evil california resentment of chinese laborers in the gold rush mines and on the railroads helped produce the chinese exclusion act of 1882 , the first federal law to restrict immigration by people of a specific ethnicity during world war ii , californians incarcerated thousands of law abiding american citizens of japanese descent while leaving those of german and italian descent unmolested after that war ended , african american migrants to california were surprised to find racist real estate redlining and a virulent west coast version of jim crow tim watkins , president of
the early stock market reaction to donald j trumps election victory was overwhelmingly positive but that doesnt mean a trump presidency will be good for the economy stock markets often serve as an economic scoreboard increasing stock prices are equated with economic victory but these inferences are too facile , because some increases connote good news , while others do not reading market movements such as the steep rise in stock prices in the early postelection days , as well as the subsequent ups and downs requires a rosetta stone constructing one takes an understanding of what drives stock prices and how that relates to the overall health of the economy buying stock in a company entitles the owner to a percentage of present and future profits the share price should be equivalent to a prediction of what these future profits will be thats the theory , anyway , and stock markets , when they work , excel because these stocks are traded assets and all traders can contribute to the markets overall prediction if traders feel stock prices are low relative to future profits , they will bid up prices if they feel prices are high , they will sell and drive down prices in this way , the final price represents a collective prediction by the entire market an increase in stock prices therefore signals an expected increase in future profits the movement in stock prices has a direct effect shareholders are immediately wealthier anyone holding a retirement portfolio knows the all too familiar feeling of reading stock price movements through the narrow lens of how well you can retire this does not benefit all people in the economy some shares are held by citizens of other countries , and the shares held in this country are not equitably held but at the least , a surge in stock prices equals more wealth for the citizenry but rising stock prices can spell good news for other reasons even many of those who do not own stocks can expect a brighter future this is because when companies prosper , consumers frequently also do well this notion can be somewhat counterintuitive after all , we often reflexively assume that when businesses make more money , they do so at our expense , that is , by overcharging us in a well functioning market , though , the interests of companies and consumers are aligned businesses profit when customers enthusiastically buy their products higher profits mean happier customers the economy as a whole is doing well by way of example , suppose apple unveils a new iphone that buoys its stock price traders are bullish about the iphones robust sales they are focused on the fact that these sales add to apples coffers but each sale , assuming consumers are choosing wisely , is also presumably producing joy for consumers this example also makes clear when the stock market can be a poor scoreboard for the economy sometimes companies can profit without improving consumers lives , or possibly even by worsening them for example , part of the stock surge after the election most likely occurred because of a widely held belief that a trump administration would slash regulations that may be good for some companies bottom lines , but is that good for everyone else \? it depends do those regulations hinder only products that were profitable and good for consumers \? or do they also hinder products that are bad for consumers \? take the case of wells fargo , which was recently found to have created millions of accounts in customers names without their knowledge these accounts were profitable for wells fargo , but surely not good for consumers the extent of this behavior was uncovered because of the work of a regulatory watchdog the consumer financial protection bureau mr trumps election increases the possibility that the bureau will be shut down or that its powers will be curtailed but if this prospect raises the value of bank stocks because it makes it more likely that behavior like wells fargos can flourish , thats hardly cause for celebration and its not good news for the economy in short , whether a rise in stock prices is good or bad for nonshareholders depends on whether the increase in profits arises because companies are serving consumers or because they are profiting at consumers expense there is a final factor to consider the capacity of traders to make predictions about future profits is limited in 1997 , michael rashes , then a doctoral student in economics at harvard and now a principal at bracebridge capital , noticed something funny about stock prices on oct 1 , worldcom made a bid for mci communications shares listed under the symbol mci went up that day in itself , that wasnt surprising good news raises prices the problem , as mr rashes noted , was that the ticker symbol mci belonged to massmutual corporate investors this fund had nothing to do with mci communications , which traded under the ticker symbol mcic his paper was published in the journal of finance in 2001 , under the title massively confused investors making conspicuously ignorant choices \( mci mcic \) this was not a freak event traders are highly fallible on oct 4 , 2013 , for example , after twitter announced its initial public offering , the stock price of the boston based consumer electronics chain tweeter , which had filed for bankruptcy in 2007 , rose to 15 cents a share from the previous days close of less than 1 cent trading was eventually halted a large body of research now emphasizes a basic fact despite the rise of computers and artificial intelligence , markets are , at their root , made up of human traders yes , the crowd is often smarter than the individual but smarter does not mean perfect many of the biases of individual traders become broader market biases in
oklahoma city after russell westbrook made his entrance to the theme song of the harlem globetrotters , he thanked god , his family and michael jordan , who had introduced him jordans presence , westbrook said , meant a great deal to him and then westbrook , the last of six new inductees into the oklahoma hall of fame , peered into a black tie crowd that filled a large ballroom at cox convention center on thursday night i dont know how to read off a teleprompter , westbrook said , so ive got this piece of paper he wanted to make sure that he got it right the evening , just days removed from one of the most divisive presidential elections in modern history , had been largely without talk of politics there was one joke about president elect donald j trumps colorful language , but that was about as far as anyone seemed willing to go instead , it had been a night for oklahomans to express pride in their state and to honor those among them who had made contributions to their communities the inductees included a federal judge , a former commander of the oklahoma air national guard , a businessman , a television personality and a broadway star but westbrook , the high motor point guard of the oklahoma city thunder , stood apart he stood apart because he had grown up in los angeles he stood apart because of his job he stood apart because of his race and he stood apart because of the message he chose to deliver after witnessing the divisions and challenges of our nation that weve been facing over the last several months , ive realized this honor is not about me , nor is it about the people in this room , he said oklahoma is an unbelievable community im so appreciative of the fact that the people of oklahoma have been so supportive of welcoming my family and i however , theres always room to grow i can be better , you can be better , and we can be better together he went on our state is made up of unbelievable , talented individuals , and i look forward to celebrating them no matter their race , gender or creed i accept this award for all the kids who are told because of the color of their skin , where they come from or what talent they dont have , they somehow cant achieve westbrook received several ovations , and gov mary fallin thanked him on behalf of the entire state for staying in oklahoma \( you may have heard that westbrook signed a contract extension over the summer , not long after a high profile teammate left for a lucrative job in the bay area \) fallins line got another huge round of applause but the dynamic was striking in oklahoma , trump won 65 3 percent of the popular vote one of the most lopsided results in the country fallin , a conservative republican , endorsed him and trump often campaigned using inflammatory rhetoric about race , gender and religion , going so far as to call for a ban on muslim immigrants after the election , westbrook told reporters that he did not vote for trump , but he declined to elaborate on thursday , without explicitly referring to the election or to trump , westbrook made his feelings clear there was nothing about his speech that was particularly controversial he called for unity , for understanding and for equal opportunity but given the political climate and his outsize celebrity here in one of the countrys reddest states , everything westbrook said seemed to mean something more many n b a players and coaches have been speaking out about social issues in recent months , and westbrook , while receiving one of the states highest honors , chose to add his voice to the chorus i challenge each of you to join me in being productive citizens and in seeking to bring hope and healing to every community , he said regardless of our backgrounds and our upbringings , we can work together to impact the lives of every young person in the state and across this nation a year ago , westbrook was introducing kevin durant before his induction into the oklahoma hall of fame his induction did not dissuade durant from spurning the thunder in free agency months later to sign with the golden state warriors perhaps the selection committee is hoping for better luck with westbrook , whose contract extension has an opt out clause in 2018 in the meantime , he appears determined to take a sledgehammer to the rest of the league after fridays victory here over the nets , westbrook was averaging over 31 points , 9 rebounds and 10 assists a game jordan , a five time n b a most valuable player who now owns the charlotte hornets , said he came to thursdays ceremony at the invitation of clay bennett , the owner of the thunder jordan said the people of oklahoma city ought to be proud of the sense of loyalty that westbrook had shown them , and then he took a mild swipe at durant im not here to bash anyone thats not here , jordan said to the delight of those in attendance im not saying that you dont have a choice everybody has a choice throughout his professional life , jordan has largely avoided using his platform to wade into the realm of politics that has always been his prerogative , his choice on thursday , he catered to the crowd im not from oklahoma , but i feel like im from oklahoma , he said and described westbrook as a very , very special kid before long , jordan wrapped up his introduction and ceded the stage to a player from a different generation , to a young man
it is a truism that america has become a more diverse country it is also a beautiful thing to watch visitors from other countries , particularly those having trouble incorporating different ethnic groups and faiths , are amazed that we manage to pull it off not perfectly , of course , but certainly better than any european or asian nation today its an extraordinary success story but how should this diversity shape our politics \? the standard liberal answer for nearly a generation now has been that we should become aware of and celebrate our differences which is a splendid principle of moral pedagogy but disastrous as a foundation for democratic politics in our ideological age in recent years american liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial , gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalisms message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing one of the many lessons of the recent presidential election campaign and its repugnant outcome is that the age of identity liberalism must be brought to an end hillary clinton was at her best and most uplifting when she spoke about american interests in world affairs and how they relate to our understanding of democracy but when it came to life at home , she tended on the campaign trail to lose that large vision and slip into the rhetoric of diversity , calling out explicitly to african american , latino , l g b t and women voters at every stop this was a strategic mistake if you are going to mention groups in america , you had better mention all of them if you dont , those left out will notice and feel excluded which , as the data show , was exactly what happened with the white working class and those with strong religious convictions fully two thirds of white voters without college degrees voted for donald trump , as did over 80 percent of white evangelicals the moral energy surrounding identity has , of course , had many good effects affirmative action has reshaped and improved corporate life black lives matter has delivered a wake up call to every american with a conscience hollywoods efforts to normalize homosexuality in our popular culture helped to normalize it in american families and public life but the fixation on diversity in our schools and in the press has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self defined groups , and indifferent to the task of reaching out to americans in every walk of life at a very young age our children are being encouraged to talk about their individual identities , even before they have them by the time they reach college many assume that diversity discourse exhausts political discourse , and have shockingly little to say about such perennial questions as class , war , the economy and the common good in large part this is because of high school history curriculums , which anachronistically project the identity politics of today back onto the past , creating a distorted picture of the major forces and individuals that shaped our country \( the achievements of womens rights movements , for instance , were real and important , but you cannot understand them if you do not first understand the founding fathers achievement in establishing a system of government based on the guarantee of rights \) when young people arrive at college they are encouraged to keep this focus on themselves by student groups , faculty members and also administrators whose full time job is to deal with and heighten the significance of diversity issues fox news and other conservative media outlets make great sport of mocking the campus craziness that surrounds such issues , and more often than not they are right to which only plays into the hands of populist demagogues who want to delegitimize learning in the eyes of those who have never set foot on a campus how to explain to the average voter the supposed moral urgency of giving college students the right to choose the designated gender pronouns to be used when addressing them \? how not to laugh along with those voters at the story of a university of michigan prankster who wrote in his majesty \? this campus diversity consciousness has over the years filtered into the liberal media , and not subtly affirmative action for women and minorities at americas newspapers and broadcasters has been an extraordinary social achievement and has even changed , quite literally , the face of right wing media , as journalists like megyn kelly and laura ingraham have gained prominence but it also appears to have encouraged the assumption , especially among younger journalists and editors , that simply by focusing on identity they have done their jobs recently i performed a little experiment during a sabbatical in france for a full year i read only european publications , not american ones my thought was to try seeing the world as european readers did but it was far more instructive to return home and realize how the lens of identity has transformed american reporting in recent years how often , for example , the laziest story in american journalism about the first x to do y is told and retold fascination with the identity drama has even affected foreign reporting , which is in distressingly short supply however interesting it may be to read , say , about the fate of transgender people in egypt , it contributes nothing to educating americans about the powerful political and religious currents that will determine egypts future , and indirectly , our own no major news outlet in europe would think of adopting such a focus but it is at the level of electoral politics that identity liberalism has failed most spectacularly , as we have just seen national politics in healthy periods is not about difference , it is about
denver uranium mines around the grand canyon oil drilling rigs studding the arctic national wildlife refuge new coal and timber leases in the national forests states divvying up millions of acres of federal land to dispose of as they wish to environmental groups , it would be a nightmare to miners , loggers , ranchers and conservative politicians in resource dependent areas , it would be about time either way , donald j trumps election presages huge potential change on americas 640 million acres of federal public lands , from the deep seas east of maine to the volcanic coasts of hawaii into a new world , said bruce babbitt , who ran the interior department under president bill clinton in western states , where about half of all land is controlled by federal agencies , mr trumps supporters hope the pendulum swings back from what they say are overbearing obama administration regulations that put sage grouse and owls ahead of economic growth environmental groups are urging president obama to push through last minute preservation projects , such as naming a new national monument in the bears ears area of southern utah and they are already preparing for battles over mr trumps campaign promise to unleash coal , oil and gas production much of it on public land but the unknowns and political variables are huge , too mr trump himself , while promising to push resource extraction , has also at times spoken about preserving public lands for future generations history also suggests that changing lands policy is not so easy president george w bush , a republican , tried to change direction with new agency rules , only to be blocked by federal appeals court decisions automation in the timber industry means that even an expanded license to cut trees in the national forests might not restore old mill towns to their blue collar glory and the cost of managing federal lands , especially in fighting wildfires 2 1 billion last year , a record total , matched by the most acres burned in at least 30 years continues to soar , threatening communities even as many of them look for new direction from the white house in how those lands are managed we have a huge and growing inventory of timber in the forests , and theyre going to decompose or burn , and nobody has addressed that , said robert h nelson , a professor in the school of public policy at the university of maryland and a former economic analyst for the interior department theres bipartisan consensus that the federal lands system is dysfunctional , he said but the hopes , and the fears , about how that system might now change are boundless my big hope is that people would be able to go back to work in san juan county and these rural areas , said phil lyman , a county commissioner in southern utah , where antigovernment feelings run as deep as the slot canyons you just feel like everything has been stifled with regulations at the western watersheds project , a conservation group focusing on the rocky mountain region , legal teams are on deck and ready to fight back were getting ready for an onslaught of anti environmental policy , and were arming up to litigate , said erik molvar , the groups executive director the trump administration is going to find it very difficult to take away all of the federal laws which have been adopted over the past 40 years in the decades long struggle for control of americas public lands , the obama years were a flush time for conservation groups the administration imposed moratoriums on uranium drilling near the grand canyon and blocked new coal leases public lands were also adapted for new uses on mr obamas watch , notably a wave of national monuments based around cultural or historical significance , and a big expansion of solar energy on federal lands in nevada conservatives who loathed those regulations or new uses are now hoping mr trump shifts the balance decisively in their favor republicans in congress have proposed bills weakening federal laws that protect wilderness , water quality , endangered species or that allow presidents to unilaterally name new national monuments some conservatives hope mr trump will support their efforts to hand federal land over to states , which could sell it off or speed up drilling approvals to see where change may come the quickest , look to the edges of glacier national park in montana , at a quilt of rocky peaks and wetlands held sacred by the blackfeet tribe in march , the obama administration capped a three decade fight over oil and gas drilling in the area , called the badger two medicine , by canceling a louisiana energy companys lease on 6 , 000 acres the company , solenex , sued a lawyer for the company , william perry pendley of the mountain states legal foundation , said the incoming trump administration could simply decide that canceling the lease had been wrong all it would take , he said , is for the justice department to enter the case and say , weve re evaluated we will lift the suspension and well permit the drilling to go forward this week , the interior department announced that a separate energy company with oil and gas leases on 32 , 000 acres in the same area had voluntarily canceled them blackfeet tribal leaders called it a victory for cooperation among industry , conservation activists and the government proponents of two major oil pipeline projects are also optimistic mr trump has said he would move quickly to approve the keystone xl pipeline , which mr obama blocked the chief executive of the texas company building the dakota access pipeline near the standing rock sioux reservation in north dakota said he believed that now delayed project would sail through under mr trump to see
beijing zou dangrong knows he will have to orange up his man , if he is to convince china that tang xinhua , a retired music professor , is donald j trump , the president elect of the united states the goal is to get mr tang looking enough like mr trump that he can impersonate the president elect and entertain at lucrative company debuts , shopping mall openings and new years galas steel yourselves after a slew of made in china trump products , including toilets and construction supplies , here comes a made in china trump , the man mr zou specializes in finding chinese who resemble famous politicians and can sing and act , then marketing them he already has two barack obamas , several kim jong uns and even a vladimir v putin in his stable it is all good , clean fun with high artistic standards , he said a good trump impersonator should look like him , be a talented performer , have a sense of humor , be tall and broad , outgoing and energetic , mr zou said in a telephone interview from yueyang , in hunan province , where his company , hunan dangrong film and television media center , is based he should have the air of a celebrity , he said because the real trump is good at performing mr zou requested that his future star not be contacted , saying mr tang , 61 , who is from the central chinese province of hubei , was not ready for the media spotlight mr zou also asked that the name of the music academy where mr tang once taught not be disclosed , saying he was afraid it would make it easier for a bigger , richer agency to locate mr tang and poach his services zhu dake , a professor and cultural critic at tongji university in shanghai , said that performers who could emulate celebrities and other public figures filled a real need in china theres a large demand for impersonators , professor zhu said actors who can portray communist leaders like mao zedong and zhou enlai have long been needed for propaganda films , he said that tradition continued as socialism morphed into money making after the mao era , he said now there are also demands for impersonators of western celebrities for more casual , less serious films and performances , he added mr zous hunt for a chinese donald trump began after the real mr trump and his democratic opponent , hillary clinton , received their parties presidential nominations for months , mr zou received tips from a network of friends in the entertainment industry , he said it was only this week , he said , that he found mr tang , after mr tangs wife recommended her husband for the role but how to make a chinese man look like mr trump , whose complexion tends toward the florid , a tint rarely seen in china \? mr zou acknowledged that it was an issue but that it was manageable with makeup artists and stylists the hair color can easily be changed with dye jobs temporary color , not permanent , keeping it in for an hour or two , he said weve asked tailors to make the same clothes that trump wore in his campaign , though maybe from less expensive material mr zou faced similar aesthetic challenges with xiao jiguo , a former security guard who has had an extraordinarily successful career impersonating president obama yet finding two barack obamas , as mr zou ultimately did , was easier than finding one mr trump i think making a successful trump impersonator is more challenging than making an obama impersonator , mr zou said he added that mr obama had a reputation as a kind man , and its easy for people to like him but peoples reactions to trump are so different , he said people who like him like him very much , but there are also so many people who dislike him just as much by contrast , finding impersonators for kim jong un , the north korean leader , was easy , mr zou said , and he has several covering all possible outcomes in the presidential election , mr zou said he also searched for a clinton impersonator , but failed hillary looks very domineering , and that characteristic isnt common among chinese women , he said mr zou said that he was optimistic about mr tangs abilities he speaks both english and russian , which means we can make things high end , mr zou said i think if we turn trumps speeches into song lyrics , it would be funny and popular , he said trump is funny and , according to mr zou , mr tang is keen to shine his wife said he liked performing , but hed missed opportunities when he was young , mr zou said now that hes retired he could give it a go particularly important though , is that mr tang is only nine years younger than mr trump , 70 its better to be younger , mr zou said if he were older , id be worried about him going out and performing noticeably missing from mr zous stable of would be stars is an impersonator for president xi jinping we also have impersonators of chinese leaders , such as mao zedong , mr zou said but we dont have xi impersonators now is not the right time chinese officials do not welcome comedy at their expense , and even good humored satire is generally not permitted many companies have asked me to find impersonators for xi and his wife , peng , mr zou said , referring to peng liyuan but i think their events dont match xis image right now mr xi has cultivated an image as an avuncular but stern figure , and
after the election of donald j trump , technology companies like facebook , twitter and google have been called to account for magnifying the anger and misinformation of the voters who helped propel him to the presidency facebook and google , for example , have both carried fake , frequently incendiary , articles that were highly shared by their users twitter has allowed those kinds of stories to proliferate as well , while also becoming a proxy battlefield where far right hate groups organize and recruit , frequently targeting women and minorities on the site the leaders of these tech businesses say they are neutral platforms that shouldnt try to police political debates facebook explains that it cant be held accountable for the material shared on its site because it is not a news organization nice try these sites are not neutral platforms , but robust businesses that have financial incentives to share fake news and encourage their users to stew in their own hateful juices the more they stew , the more time they spend on the site in the case of a fake news story that claimed that mr trump won the popular vote , google made money because it arrived as an advertisement keyed to searches about the election results that wasnt the only role that silicon valley played in this election tech companies didnt face the same degree of populist assault as the banks , but they came to embody as much as wall street the harsh , unequal american economy that didnt care a lick for the people left behind there is an enormous disconnect between silicon valley and the people it serves mr trump himself saw the disconnect and exploited it by attacking companies like amazon \( for tax avoidance \) and apple \( for outsourcing labor on its products \) , mr trump was able to signal his opposition to the technological elites just as he went after hillary clintons highly paid speeches to goldman sachs more than that , mr trump campaigned on restoring jobs and manufacturing , which silicon valley derides as the old economy technology companies believe in the idea of disruption , their great promise to the world internet driven efficiency replaces the friction holding us back bureaucrats , unions , brick and mortar stores , cumbersome factories along with libraries , the post office , taxis and hotels they see america as a reclamation project led by a passel of supersmart silicon valley entrepreneurs the american auto industry is their ultimate example of failed thinking and undisrupted inertia marc andreessen , the silicon valley investor , said on twitter that detroit is what happens when you have 30 years of stultification and rigidity that is what is to be avoided here is the explanation from reid hoffman , linkedins founder and a clinton supporter , for detroits failures the overriding problem was this the auto industry got too comfortable , he wrote in his book , the start up of you \( the title alone speaks volumes \) the moment you begin to take success for granted is the moment a competitor lunges for your jugular he also attacked any notion of continuity instead of rewarding the best people in the organization and firing the worst , they promoted on the basis of longevity and nepotism mr hoffman goes further , arguing that its not only companies that must harness new technologies to thrive in a dog eat dog world people must harness them , as well the conditions in which entrepreneurs start and grow companies are the conditions we all now live in when fashioning a career , he wrote you never know whats going to happen next information is limited resources are tight competition is fierce the world is changing and the amount of time you spend at any one job is shrinking this means you need to be adapting all the time and if you fail to adapt , no one not your employer , not the government is going to catch you when you fall its an exhausting , darwinian life he is describing endlessly adapting to a changing , pitiless world and its precisely the opposite kind of life that mr trump was espousing his voters wish to return to the inefficient , enthusiastically nepotistic \( you might call it family based \) factory life of the 1950s and 60s when america was great mr trump promised to bring his supporters jobs back the only thing he wanted to disrupt is the global economy its unclear how mr trump plans to deliver this nostalgic fantasy but at least he wasnt publicly scoffing at the dream or commending a life as the hardest working uber driver there is one final irony tech companies see the benefits of disruption as knocking down traditional barriers and conventions that hold back individuals in the election , the biggest beneficiary of disruption was mr trump , who defied all rules around decency , responsibility , truthfulness , consistency and even social custom , like releasing tax returns and when he wanted to express his outrage , attack a woman for being fat or his opponent for being crooked and the system rigged , he went on twitter turns out that social and cultural institutions can act as buffers in society , so that political transitions can be made peacefully , that standards of truth can prevail and that women and minorities wont be targeted by hateful discourse but civility and empathy can be disrupted , too by fostering rampant individualism and a disregard for traditional institutions , the tech companies are now under threat from a candidate they helped create its no coincidence that tech stocks are down since the election , even as the broader market

president elect donald trump says he will move immediately to deport or imprison two million , maybe three million , unauthorized immigrant criminals what we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records , gang members , drug dealers , he said on sunday on 60 minutes like many of his proposals , this one sounds tough and straightforward , but makes no sense under scrutiny and is frightening to think about start with the fact that the target number is made up there simply arent as many criminal immigrants as he imagines according to rough estimates by the migration policy institute , of the countrys 11 million unauthorized immigrants , about 820 , 000 have criminal records about 300 , 000 of those have felony convictions and are presumably the bad people mr trump is talking about if he deports those and only those , it will be a remarkable display of law enforcement discretion , since he said that there were lots of terrific people among the unauthorized who might be allowed to stay , after the border is secured and after everything gets normalized and yet he also said that two million to three million would go , a population about the size of chicagos he would have to haul away a lot of terrific people , and terrorize many more , to hit that mark this would require a vast conscription of state and local law enforcement against people who pose no threat it would mean a surge in home and workplace raids , investigations and traffic stops it took the obama administration eight years to deport 2 5 million immigrants the threat of mr trump chasing that number right off the bat is the reason immigrant communities are so terrified but the damage wont be immediate he cant just load two million people onto buses and planes and ship them out hell first have to stuff them into the bottleneck of the immigration courts , where there are too few judges and lawyers for a swollen caseload , and fill detention cells to bursting mr trump may be unaware of due process , or in denial about it , but it exists all the while he would be snatching workers from their jobs , workers who keep the economy humming then there is the policing problem indiscriminate roundups in immigrant communities cause crime victims to fear and avoid the police , and crime to fester weve been down this ugly path before arizona followed it for years under sheriff joe arpaio of maricopa county , a trump ally who broke the law , abused civil rights and neglected other law enforcement duties it took years of struggle by human rights advocates , in the streets and the courts , but voters finally ousted sheriff arpaio in this months election how can the country resist if mr trump tries to nationalize the arizona model with mass deportation \? much of the response will have to be local the list of cities where leaders and police officials have vowed not to participate in a trump dragnet is long and growing immigration is a federal responsibility , they say , and they will not waste policing resources , money or time on a destructive plan that wont work that is not our job , nor will i make it our job , said the los angeles police chief , charlie beck mayor bill de blasio of new york struck the right note we are not going to sacrifice a half million people who live amongst us , who are part of our communities thats the kind of determination that public officials will need to summon if mr trump begins a senseless purge , all segments of society religious congregations , factories , farms , colleges and universities , private individuals will need to speak out and defend the vulnerable day laborers the likeliest victims of harassment and vigilantism will need to be protected mr trump and his republican allies in congress have threatened to cut off federal funding to immigrant friendly sanctuary cities like san francisco , chicago and new york its unclear what budgetary pain they can cause but we can only hope that these places stand firm at a time when cherished american ideals are under siege
five years ago , i warned about the risk of a donald j trump presidency most people laughed they thought it inconceivable i was not particularly prescient i come from italy , and i had already seen this movie , starring silvio berlusconi , who led the italian government as prime minister for a total of nine years between 1994 and 2011 i knew how it could unfold now that mr trump has been elected president , the berlusconi parallel could offer an important lesson in how to avoid transforming a razor thin victory into a two decade affair if you think presidential term limits and mr trumps age could save the country from that fate , think again his tenure could easily turn into a trump dynasty mr berlusconi was able to govern italy for as long as he did mostly thanks to the incompetence of his opposition it was so rabidly obsessed with his personality that any substantive political debate disappeared it focused only on personal attacks , the effect of which was to increase mr berlusconis popularity his secret was an ability to set off a pavlovian reaction among his leftist opponents , which engendered instantaneous sympathy in most moderate voters mr trump is no different we saw this dynamic during the presidential campaign hillary clinton was so focused on explaining how bad mr trump was that she too often didnt promote her own ideas , to make the positive case for voting for her the news media was so intent on ridiculing mr trumps behavior that it ended up providing him with free advertising unfortunately , the dynamic has not ended with the election shortly after mr trump gave his acceptance speech , protests sprang up all over america what are these people protesting against \? whether we like it or not , mr trump won legitimately denying that only feeds the perception that there are legitimate candidates and illegitimate ones , and a small elite decides which is which if thats true , elections are just a beauty contest among candidates blessed by the guardian council of clerics , just like in iran these protests are also counterproductive there will be plenty of reasons to complain during the trump presidency , when really awful decisions are made why complain now , when no decision has been made \? it delegitimizes the future protests and exposes the bias of the opposition even the petition calling for members of the electoral college to violate their mandate and not vote for mr trump could play into the president elects hands this idea is misguided what ground would we then have to stand on when mr trump tricks the system to obtain what he wants \? the italian experience provides a blueprint for how to defeat mr trump only two men in italy have won an electoral competition against mr berlusconi romano prodi and the current prime minister , matteo renzi \( albeit only in a 2014 european election \) both of them treated mr berlusconi as an ordinary opponent they focused on the issues , not on his character in different ways , both of them are seen as outsiders , not as members of what in italy is defined as the political caste the democratic party should learn this lesson it should not do as the republicans did after president obama was elected their preconceived opposition to any of his initiatives poisoned the washington well , fueling the anti establishment reaction \( even if it was a successful electoral strategy for the party \) there are plenty of trump proposals that democrats can agree with , like new infrastructure investments most democrats , including politicians like mrs clinton and bernie sanders and economists like lawrence summers and paul krugman , have pushed the idea of infrastructure as a way to increase demand and to expand employment among non college educated workers some details might be different from a republican plan , but it will add credibility to the democratic opposition if it tries to find the points in common , not just differences and an opposition focused on personality would crown mr trump as the peoples leader of the fight against the washington caste it would also weaken the opposition voice on the issues , where it is important to conduct a battle of principles democrats should also offer mr trump help against the republican establishment , an offer that would reveal whether his populism is empty language or a real position for example , with mr trumps encouragement , the republican platform called for reinstating the glass steagall act , which would separate investment and commercial banking the democrats should declare their support of this separation , a policy that many republicans oppose the last thing they should want is for mr trump to use the republican establishment as a fig leaf for his own failure , dumping on it the responsibility for blocking the popular reforms that he promised during the campaign and probably never intended to pass that will only enlarge his image as a hero of the people shackled by the elites finally , the democratic party should also find a credible candidate among young leaders , one outside the partys brahmins the news that chelsea clinton is considering running for office is the worst possible if the democratic party is turning into a monarchy , how can it fight the autocratic tendencies in mr trump \?
since the election , the west coast has been abuzz with talk of breaking away from donald trumps america a calexit , or a linking of the nations most populous state with oregon , washington and british columbia to form a cascadia by the sea its a fantasy , of course , fueled by trumps drubbing on the west coast , where he got less than 10 percent of the vote in some cities but it would also be a monumental mistake for the most prosperous and progressive part of the united states to even consider abandoning a country that could be dominated by the old confederacy a better idea is to reach out across a yawning class divide people in the west could listen to their fellow americans in the old industrial heartland and people in struggling towns could learn something from the workable policies of the left coast difficult as that conversation may be , it could start with some white on white dialogue in the fast hardening concrete of postelection analysis , the presidential vote was seen as a whitelash , as van jones called it , against barack obamas presidency no doubt , race played a big part in trumps electoral college win but on nov 8 , heavily white cities particularly in the west rejected trump by huge margins in portland , ore , often called the whitest city in america , trump pulled barely 17 percent of the vote in the county covering most of the metro area , and even less in the city proper in seattle , which is nearly 70 percent white , trump is on track to get only 8 percent of the vote a historic low for a major party nominee denver , which is 63 percent white , didnt even give trump one in five votes and in san francisco , with a black population of 6 percent , trump finished in single digits this fortress of the forward looking is not all white , certainly california , after all , has no ethnic majority but for the sake of preventing a certain clueless conventional wisdom from taking hold , lets consider the other white people and yes , some of these voters are too precious and self involved they have their six figure jobs at facebook or amazon , google or the gates foundation youngstown , ohio , is what \? a foreign place , or like that town in the office this west coast majority cares about climate change , tech and trade they care about where their food comes and want family friendly policies that dont knock women out of their career trajectories they arent afraid of raising taxes to make their cities more livable in fact , they just raised taxes to build new infrastructure they dont think lunatics should be able to buy assault rifles and their issues were completely forgotten in the presidential campaign were a nation state , said gavin newsom , californias lieutenant governor , after the election in so many ways we are america but were just ahead of the curve california , which went democratic by a nearly two to one margin and is one big reason hillary clinton will win the popular tally by well over a million votes , feels particularly left out people in the state are beating drums to the spectral rhythms of the old bear flag revolt , which briefly produced an independent california republic in 1846 instead , california should leverage its political clout with almost one in eight members of the house hailing from the golden state to stop trumps backward ideas the biggest lesson from the west coast is about job and wage growth trump wants to return to the 19th century of dirty energy but coals biggest enemy is cheap natural gas , not environmental regulation no sane company wants to build a new coal fired electrical plant in september , 42 percent of all new jobs created in the country were in california at the same time , oregon posted a job creation rate that was double the national average and earlier this year , washington state was ranked no 1 for combined job and wage growth yes , wage growth the west coast has consistently voted to make minimum wage a livable wage something opposed by republicans in the capital but even better jobs are there for the making in infrastructure trump claims hell put people to work building roads , bridges and airports , while lowering taxes on the rich he can no more make flint tap water into trump wine but there is a simple solution , adopted on election day throughout the west coast targeted tax increases voters approved of them because the money will be dedicated to new infrastructure expanded and ambitious light rail systems in seattle and los angeles , for example no burger flipping there it was absurd and unpatriotic when texans talked of secession rather than be led by barack obama apparently , they couldnt handle all the job growth that came with his historic presidency its equally absurd for californians to talk of taking their macs and walking out after trumps barbarians move into the white house the united states , without the innovative west coast , would be a yesterday country
over the past few days weve seen what happens when you assign someone a single identity pollsters assumed that most latinos would vote only as latinos , and therefore against donald trump but a surprising percentage voted for him pollsters assumed women would vote primarily as women , and go for hillary clinton but a surprising number voted against her they assumed african americans would vote along straight democratic lines , but a surprising number left the top line of the ballot blank the pollsters reduced complex individuals to a single identity , and are now embarrassed but pollsters are not the only people guilty of reductionist solitarism this mode of thinking is one of the biggest problems facing this country today trump spent the entire campaign reducing people to one identity and then generalizing muslims are only one thing , and they are dangerous mexicans are only one thing , and that is alien when trump talked about african americans he always talked about inner city poverty , as if that was the sum total of the black experience in america bigots turn multidimensional human beings into one dimensional creatures anti semites define jewishness in a certain crude miniaturizing way racists define both blackness and whiteness in just that manner populists dehumanize complex people into the moronic categories of the people and the elites but its not only racists who reduce people to a single identity these days its the anti racists , too to raise money and mobilize people , advocates play up ethnic categories to an extreme degree large parts of popular culture and pretty much all of stand up comedy consist of reducing people to one or another identity and then making jokes about that generalization the people who worry about cultural appropriation reduce people to an ethnic category and argue that those outside can never understand it a single identity walls off empathy and the imagination were even seeing a wave of voluntary reductionism people feel besieged , or theyre intellectually lazy , so they reduce themselves to one category being an evangelical used to mean practicing a certain form of faith but evangelical has gone from being an adjective to a noun , a simplistic tribal identity that commands republican affiliation unfortunately , if you reduce complex individuals to one thing youll go through life clueless about the world around you peoples classifications now shape how they see the world plus , as the philosopher amartya sen has argued , this mentality makes the world more flammable crude tribal dividing lines inevitably arouse a besieged , victimized us them mentality this mentality assumes that the relations between groups are zero sum and antagonistic people with this mentality tolerate dishonesty , misogyny and terrorism on their own side because all morality lays down before the tribal imperative the only way out of this mess is to continually remind ourselves that each human is a conglomeration of identities ethnic , racial , professional , geographic , religious and so on even each identity itself is not one thing but a tradition of debate about the meaning of that identity furthermore , the dignity of each person is not found in the racial or ethnic category that each has inherited , but in the moral commitments that each individual has chosen and lived out getting out of this mess also means accepting the limits of social science the judgments of actual voters are better captured in the narratives of journalism and historical analysis than in the brutalizing correlations of big data rebinding the nation means finding shared identities , not just contrasting ones if we want to improve race relations , its not enough to have a conversation about race we also have to emphasize identities people have in common across the color line if you can engage different people together as marines or teachers , then you will have built an empathetic relationship , and people can learn one anothers racial experiences naturally finally , we have to revive the american identity for much of the 20th century , america had a rough consensus about the american idea historians congregated around a common narrative people put great stock in civic rituals like the pledge but that consensus is now in tatters , stretched by globalization , increasing diversity as well as failures of civic education now many americans dont recognize one another or their country the line i heard most on election night was , this is not my america we will have to construct a new national idea that binds and embraces all our particular identities the good news , as my times colleague april lawson points out , is that there wasnt mass violence last week that could have happened amid a civic clash this ugly and passionate thats a sign that for all the fear and anger of this season , theres still mutual attachment among us , something to build on but there has to be a rejection of single identity thinking and a continual embrace of the reality that each of us is a mansion with many rooms

seneca falls , n y as election day approached , a new plaque was prepared at the national womens hall of fame here , for hillary clinton the polls were suggesting that mrs clinton would be the first woman elected president she was already among the 266 women enshrined in the hall , a former bank building with pillars staff members suggested to jeanne giovannini , the president , that a new plaque should be available to a potential flood of jubilant visitors we wanted to be ready , said ms giovannini , who said she makes a point of maintaining political neutrality they put the plaque in a second floor office it never came downstairs seneca falls , cradle of the national movement for womens rights , was swept up by the same electoral cyclone that lifted donald j trump , the republican candidate , to the presidency the town supported mrs clinton , but barely as of this week , she had tallied 1 , 740 votes here , giving her an edge of 74 votes over mr trump , with absentee ballots still to be counted in the county surrounding the town , also called seneca , mr trump was the decisive victor the county election commissioners , ruth same , a democrat , and tiffany folk , a republican , said mr trump had 6 , 719 votes as of tuesday , about 52 percent of the vote , compared with 40 percent for mrs clinton ms same , 72 , has been a commissioner for 30 years she and ms folk , 45 , consider themselves friends yet their reaction typifies the breach across america i was shocked , ms same said of mrs clintons defeat ms folk , for her part , said she has a deep appreciation for the regions role in the emergence of womens rights i want a female president , ms folk said i would love to have a female president this wasnt the right candidate seneca falls , about midway between syracuse and rochester , is faced with some of the core struggles mr trump targeted in the campaign companies such as sylvania , which once produced television parts here , left years ago now seneca falls is recasting itself as a tourist destination , an effort involving two themes that collided for some voters in the election historically , this is where elizabeth cady stanton and other giants of the womens rights movements gathered in 1848 to sign a declaration of sentiments , asserting that american women deserved equal status under the law stanton did not live to see the payoff it would be another 72 years before women achieved the right to vote a national park in seneca falls is intended to honor the 1848 convention plans for a centennial celebration of the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920 had been intensified by the hope that a female president might take part attendance at the national park has reached nearly 45 , 000 this year , the highest number since 1998 , according to jeffrey olson , a spokesman for the national park service ms giovannini said those numbers correspond to a surge at the hall of fame , an increase she attributes primarily to excitement surrounding mrs clintons candidacy seneca falls also lays claim to another title , contending that it was the model for its a wonderful life , frank capras holiday movie classic every december , the town holds a festival built on that idea the film is a capsule view of typical upstate new york aspirations it offers the tale of a small community bedford falls that at the last moment manages to extricate itself from a downward spiral josh and ashley sanford , a seneca falls couple with 4 year old twin sons , nicholas and gavyn , said they had put that kind of hope in their support for mr trump i want them to be able to be whatever they want to be , ms sanford said of the twins , watching them play amid the fallen leaves she is a registered nurse who goes on home visits , from rich houses by the lake to the poorest of the poor mr sanford works as a mechanic and fabricator our vets , our elderly , theyve got nothing , ms sanford said some of mr trumps statements might seem particularly discordant in seneca falls , such as his recorded comments about groping women bill lewis and donna phillips lewis explained it this way mr trump , they said , hides nothing about who he is or how he feels , even when it is ugly , which makes him the opposite of mrs clinton and many other politicians he can be redeemed , said mr lewis , 67 , a retired minister for the church of the nazarene he and ms lewis returned here eight years ago to care for older parents they said gender had played no role in their vote they are opposed to abortion rights and said mrs clintons opportunity to appoint at least one supreme court justice would have created a reckless , wide open american society she wasnt acceptable to god , ms lewis said pam bryan , who runs the copy shop in downtown seneca falls , said mrs clintons defeat was shattering she said she was frightened by mr trump at least now we can stop lying to our daughters and nieces and granddaughters when we tell them they can be anything they want to be , ms bryan said becky bly , another downtown merchant , moved here from long island to run womanmade products , whose inventory honors the towns heritage this week ms bly paused while hanging a painting of the fictional bedford falls in her storefront window to warn that mr trump is more apt to create a pottersville , referring to the ruthless tycoon in mr capras
washington it was a golden year for rudolph w giuliani , a mad dash that would take him to 11 countries on four continents , and by the time 2006 was done , earn him 16 million a princely sum compared with the 7 , 000 he claimed to have in 2001 , when he went through a divorce with salaries from a law firm and a consulting firm , and most of all 10 million from 108 speeches he delivered to audiences around the world , the lucrative year of 2006 will now , along with the rest of mr giulianis career after his tenure as new yorks mayor , be getting a new round of scrutiny if he is nominated as secretary of state by president elect donald j trump the blitz of activity by mr giuliani in 2006 speaking to wall street banks oil , gold mining and pharmaceutical companies and investor groups in japan and singapore is public because the next year , he began a campaign for president and had to file a financial disclosure form but that public ledger offers the most detailed look at just how mr giuliani managed to become so wealthy after he left office , with assets worth tens of millions of dollars , including homes he now owns in palm beach , fla , the hamptons and new york city mr giulianis speeches and travel that year and in the decade since were often related to business deals he was pursuing , or even standing agreements he had reached , like one with backers of the dissident iranian political party known as the mujahedeen khalq , which until 2012 was considered a foreign terrorist organization by the state department they offer a road map of sorts to the kinds of potential conflict of interest questions that are already emerging as mr giulianis name is floated as a possible trump cabinet member , particularly given that mr trump repeatedly mocked hillary clinton , his democratic opponent , for the many speeches she and her husband gave after they left public office when she left , she made 21 6 million giving speeches to wall street banks and other special interests in less than two years secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public , mr trump said in june together , she and bill made 153 million giving speeches to lobbyists , c e o s and foreign governments in the years since 2001 they totally own her , and that will never change in particular , mr trump criticized mrs clintons speeches to wall street banks but mr giuliani , in a one year period that ended in january 2007 , earned 750 , 000 in speaking fees before the 20 percent cut taken by the speakers agency for eight speeches he gave to wall street banks and other major financial institutions , including jpmorgan chase , merrill lynch and lehman brothers , before its collapse as with mrs clinton , there is little public record of what mr giuliani said during these events mr giuliani had rules about keeping his remarks private , as a contract addendum to which organizations that invited him to speak had to agree makes clear mr giuliani stipulated that his remarks could not be recorded , nor could general press or other media coverage of the remarks be allowed without his explicit permission he also had some elaborate demands , including that if he traveled by private plane , it be a gulfstream iv or bigger , a plane that costs about 40 , 000 for a one day trip within the united states some members of the senate , which will hold hearings and vote on his nomination if mr trump selects him , are already saying they want to learn more about mr giulianis work in the years since he left city hall im concerned generally about conflicts of interest on the part of prospective members of the administration , in every role , senator richard blumenthal , democrat of connecticut , said when asked about mr giulianis business ventures since he left office and that concern is well justified in terms of the backgrounds of some of the potential nominees that have been discussed mr giuliani , in an interview this week , defended his activities since he left office , saying he had been open about his dealings with private companies and foreign states or political parties , including the iranian group my ties to them are completely open , mr giuliani said mr giuliani certainly kept up a feverish pace in one month alone during 2006 , he gave 20 speeches from 2001 to 2008 , the year he ran for president , he was on the road as much as 200 days a year , according to anthony v carbonetti , a former new york city hall aide every time i turned , he was calling me from a different country or a different city , mr carbonetti said for most of those trips , he had a standard speech that mixed a retelling of leadership lessons outlined in his book and memories from the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , which ultimately earned him the nickname americas mayor i heard it so many times , i could have given the speech , mr carbonetti joked one area of particularly focused travel was asia mr giuliani formed a partnership with sage capital growth , a manhattan based investment firm that was exploring business opportunities in japan mr giulianis disclosure form showed a 300 , 000 speaking fee for one event in november 2005 , the largest single fee on the form , which covered 123 speeches given over a 14 month period mr giuliani was separately retained by mark advent , a las vegas based casino developer , to help him with his attempt to build a resort and casino in
in the days since an election that will substantially reduce the likelihood of your going to midtown more than three times over the next four years , the pervasive mood in new york has been grief stricken and despairing the city has emerged , perhaps unpredictably , as the nations capital of discontentment \( los angeles , san francisco , we know that you are trying \) , the frontier of enmity to the potential hardships and catastrophes donald j trumps impending presidency might produce in manhattan , hillary clinton defeated mr trump nearly nine to one thousands feel distraught many have marched or plan to march many more are searching for something constructive to do and weighing the value of symbolic gestures some mothers in brooklyn said they were thinking about a transcontinental hand holding palms clutched from cobble hill to santa monica but actions like these are as likely to invite accusations of liberal cluelessness as they are to change minds about the deportation of undocumented immigrants this past week , lena dunham posted a video of a call she made to the house speaker , paul d ryan , on instagram , relaying her concern over the appointment of the former breitbart news head stephen k bannon as a chief strategist in the trump administration \( we imagine mr ryan , a republican , listening to the message and thinking , hmm , well , maybe if i get to meet adam driver \) just days earlier , the actress , who had campaigned around the country for mrs clinton , a democrat , wrote a blog post expressing her dismay over the fact that so many white women had voted for the republican candidate , describing them with no apparent fear of invoking a tone of alienating condescension as unable to look past their own violent privilege and inoculated with hate for themselves in the age of instagram activism , it is not necessarily a simple thing to tell the earnest do gooder from the self promoter , particularly when history has just made it clear that social media celebrity is the path to world domination within the professional political class , mayor bill de blasio and gov andrew m cuomo , both democrats , now seem to be elevating their longstanding rivalry to one for the role of progressive opponent in chief in the days immediately following the election , the mayor tweeted , and emailed , and tried to comfort on wednesday , mr de blasio met with the president elect at trump tower and then held a news conference in which he proceeded to recount the concerns he had raised about a rolling back of wall street regulations , tax cuts for the wealthy , rising fears among immigrants , the prospect of increased conflict between the police and the people they serve without divulging anything of mr trumps responses a spate of television appearances followed , as well as the announcement of a speech planned for next week at cooper union asked about the potential effects of mr trumps high security presence on fifth avenue , near major businesses like gucci and tiffany , mr de blasio offered that those stores werent his central concerns in life , as if the tax and tourist revenue they generated for the city were dismissible in the face of the good sound bite he could produce by deriding luxury brands later in the day , the mayor sent out a twitter storm repeating everything he had already said then , using his re election campaign letterhead , he sent out an email \( sisters and brothers , it began \) asking new yorkers to share their thoughts and feelings with him about the coming four years of a trump administration , as though the answers werent obvious the day after the election , governor cuomo called into a program on ny1 to say that he had had a good conversation with president elect trump and that his service in the white house could be a bonus for new york certainly , two boys from queens could find a way to bridge some differences , particularly when so many actual bridges in new york required federal money for repairs a few days later , with perhaps a more accurate sense of the way voters in new york were processing the election , the governor initiated a statewide emergency call in system to handle reports of bias crime following mr trumps victory he took to his facebook page to declare that there is no place for racism , there is no place for hate , and to remind everyone that he had been behind new yorks 15 an hour minimum wage effort it is hard to imagine the outcome of this election as anything other than a net political positive for both the governor and the mayor , in the same way that the dullest colleagues can suddenly seem a lot better once you realize that all you have is one another , and a new boss who seems unhinged mr de blasio had been facing a campaign for re election next year in a climate in which white voters , particularly in the brownstone brooklyn precincts that first elected him , were disaffected by his performance despite the fact that enthusiasm for him remains tepid , his recent approval ratings , measured since the election , are better than last summer 47 percent of voters say they approve of the job he is doing , up from 42 percent in august at least for now , it is hard to imagine anyone coming in and robbing him of a second term but if we have learned anything this year , it is never to count on a given

blood on the mountain is a clumsily made attack on the coal industry in west virginia , but it benefits considerably from the events of the past two weeks the film jumps around chronologically and thematically in a way that dilutes its impact , but it still provides plenty of cause to question the wisdom of president elect donald j trumps stated intentions of reviving coal mining and reducing environmental and other regulations the film , by mari lynn evans and jordan freeman , traces the unpleasant history of coal in west virginia , including obvious black marks like the 2010 explosion at a massey energy company mine , in which 29 people died , and less obvious ones like vanishing pension and health care benefits coal companies have carried out a sort of mass brainwashing , the film suggests , using their status as the only significant employer around to generate support even among the workers they are exploiting and exposing to hazardous conditions most interesting in light of mr trumps campaign pledge to increase the number of coal industry jobs is a segment that suggests expanded coal production would not generate a significant number of jobs because mountaintop removal mining methods now in use are not as labor intensive as underground mining was the industry also has a long legacy of environmental degradation , even with federal regulation bruce stanley , a lawyer who has represented clients suing coal companies , uses a war analogy the war is the one that coal has waged on west virginia for the last 150 years , he says as the camera pans a desolate landscape you dont believe its a war \? you go find a battleground thats as war torn and scarred as the mountaintops of southern west virginia you go find a place where more explosives are set off in a month anywhere on earth the film may be one sided , but if nothing else , it is a reminder that the coal equals jobs equation is a serious oversimplification
with the election now in the rearview mirror , bloomberg has decided to terminate its daily politics show with all due respect hosted by the political journalists john heilemann and mark halperin and refocus its bloomberg politics team , according to a staff memo on thursday in the coming weeks , as washington transitions from the obama administration to the incoming trump administration , our bloomberg politics team will transition as well shifting our focus to the impact of politics and policy on the business and financial world , john micklethwait , the editor in chief of bloomberg , and justin b smith , chief executive of bloomberg media , said in the memo will all due respect , which began in october 2014 and was broadcast on bloomberg tv at 5 p m and msnbc at 6 p m , will run daily until dec 2 , after which there will be four hourlong specials setting up the presidency of donald j trump the show will end with coverage of mr trumps inauguration on jan 20 errol cockfield , a spokesman for msnbc , declined to comment on the networks plans for the 6 p m hour mr heilemann and mr halperin , the authors of the popular book game change about the 2008 election , joined bloomberg in may 2014 but their hiring caused discord between bloombergs offices in new york and washington , where journalists felt they were being overshadowed by the new politics team the show initially struggled to find an audience and was criticized in some quarters for being too frivolous with all of that in mind , the inauguration could be viewed as both a natural and convenient endpoint the duo are in discussions about staying on as contributors and columnists for bloomberg , according to the memo , though they will no longer have day to day roles bloomberg politics will shift to a more global outlook , and there are plans to start a new television show focused on global politics and the impact of the new administrations policies on business and finance worldwide , according to the memo , which was reported earlier by the huffington post the moves are part of a broader reshuffling at bloomberg , which said in a separate memo on thursday that it was revamping its magazine , bloomberg businessweek , to focus more on business and finance megan murphy , who was bloombergs washington bureau chief , was named editor of the magazine , which is expected to begin publishing in its new form in the second quarter of next year what will emerge from this will be very different from the stand alone magazine you all write for at the moment , the memo said the memo also said the editorial team at the magazine may well be smaller
phoenix alan williams and his mother , jeri , watched on television this summer as san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick protested police brutality and racial injustice by refusing to stand during the national anthem kaepernicks political statement was personal for both williams , a second year player for the phoenix suns , and his mother , who had recently agreed to become the citys police chief they began a pointed discussion over kaepernicks gesture and its potential to unravel their tightly knit relationship alan williams , 23 , said he felt obliged to support his teammates if they decided , like several other professional athletes , to join kaepernick his mother reminded him that his actions would reflect on her , and vice versa were kind of like this connected entity , she said in the end , alan williams and his teammates decided to emphasize community outreach over gestures of outrage it was a relief for williams , who could not have imagined his career and his mothers intersecting in a way that reflected some of their countrys deepest divisions its kind of crazy how its worked out , williams said saturday after the suns home loss to the nets it had been an eventful night for williams , a 6 foot 8 reserve center , who got into his second game of the season and made the only shot he took in 1 minute 32 seconds of playing time and it was the end of an eventful week for williamss mother , whose officers were deployed to keep the peace on election day after several hundred students from both her alma mater , maryvale high school , and alans , north high , staged walkouts to protest the candidacies of donald j trump and sheriff joe arpaio of maricopa county , an immigration hard liner who lost his bid for a seventh term on election eve , when the possibility loomed that hillary clinton would become the first woman to win the presidency , chief jeri williams sat in her corner office at the police department headquarters downtown and talked for nearly an hour about her own turn as a trailblazer she is the first woman and the second african american to become the phoenix police chief chief williams , 51 , pointed out a framed piece of art she had received as a gift it depicts a young black girl holding an american flag , her eyes fixed on the stars and stripes i just kind of look at her , and it reminds me that anything is possible , the chief said williams had sky high aspirations in 1988 after earning an undergraduate degree in fine arts from arizona state she applied for her dream job , as a flight attendant with pan american airlines , but did not make it past the first interview i got told i was too heavy to be a pan am girl , she said they did measurements of my elbows and my wrists , and i didnt fit the mold she found a plan b on a bulletin board that advertised openings in the police department the prospect of holding a job where no two days were the same appealed to her , and she said the departments equal pay for women was also a huge selling point she quickly realized that she had found her calling most days i went home amazed that someone was paying me to do this job , she said i get to engage with a bunch of people , i get to help people , and then i get to put bad guys in jail at first , she didnt dwell much on the dangers they became more of a concern after she and her husband , cody williams sr , a justice of the peace who played two years of basketball at the university of oklahoma , started a family in addition to alan , they have a younger son , cody jr , a student at the university of california , santa barbara when alan was a child , he watched an episode of cops , the reality series that follows police officers on duty he stayed up until his mother returned from work late and tearfully asked if she was going to get hurt doing her job she lifted her shirt and revealed her bulletproof vest , encouraging her son touch it i said , as long as im wearing this vest , im safe , she recalled during the interview , she undid a few of her shirt buttons to show that she continues to wear it always , she said just as a reminder of the promise i made to my kid her first two decades in the department included a stint as an assistant chief in 2011 , she left phoenix to become the police chief in oxnard , calif , where she oversaw a 400 person force while there , she dealt with an episode involving a bystander fatally shot by officers in a case of mistaken identity and another episode involving the death of a person in custody it was almost like for two years i couldnt breathe because i didnt know what was going to happen next , chief williams said she sought advice from an advisory board made up of people from the business and religious sectors , and said she made sure her department held itself accountable for its actions during this time , alan williams was about 40 miles north of oxnard , at santa barbara , the university he had settled on before his mother got the chiefs job she tried not to let what was happening in her workplace affect his world , but headlines critical of her department cast a long shadow i always tried to be there for her as much as possible , said williams , who starred on the gauchos basketball team she understood
to the editor re trump takes to twitter in defense of transition \( news article , nov 17 \) on nov 10 , president obama told president elect donald trump , if you succeed , then the country succeeds with all due respect , mr president , that is entirely wrong virtually every item on the trump administrations to do list makes the country weaker , from the gutting of environmental and financial regulation , to the destabilization of international security treaties , to reducing access to health care , to the terrorization of young people working and studying under deferred action for childhood arrivals , or daca more to the point , the stunning disarray , nepotism , score settling and incompetence of the trump transition effort make clear that your administration will not be assisting a transition you will be the ones making the transition happen history and the national interest may demand that you not be obstructionist but nothing requires a more positive effort in the transition , except for national security the courtesy of president bush toward you is not the same your teams met with his , as professionals in government , albeit with policy differences instructing islamophobic kooks , white supremacists and oil industry hacks in how better to degrade america is something else entirely christopher kutz berkeley , calif to the editor this is just too embarrassing donald trump is up in his ivory tower going through the motions of selecting the team that will be responsible for our government from the little updates and tidbits we are privy to , one wonders if this is not an audition for a coming season of his program the apprentice the infighting , indecisiveness , hiring and firing , and mostly the inexperience of these folks all sound like a casting session for the tv show and worse , instead of his communicating with the media , one has to look up his tweets heaven help us victoria flora norwalk , conn to the editor lets face the facts no one likes change , even if our lives are not good , but change was necessary our government was at a stalemate , totally dysfunctional we needed a major revamping but who could possibly do it \? we needed someone brave , honest , independent , wealthy , thick skinned , successful and brash enough to fight the total entrenchment of establishments strangling our american dream someone who was comfortable in front of the media we got what we wished donald trump is not perfect , but he is perfect for change we are now on a path into the unknown an adventure that the american spirit has always embraced we lost that spirit for a while , but mr trump reminded us how we can regain it mr trump has proved himself in business but , more important , he has proved himself in politics in an unconventional but brilliant campaign he defied all odds how can we doubt that he will succeed in his next phase making america great again \? charles slane new york to the editor its extraordinary donald trump could not go a week without going back on the central premise of his campaign to drain the swamp , banishing washingtons powerful special interests who have rigged our political and economic system this promise of railing against the establishment won him the republican nomination his promise to not be controlled by the donors , special interests and lobbyists who have corrupted our politics and politicians , like hillary clinton , helped swing the rust belt in his favor so that he could win the election where are the baseball caps that , instead of saying making america great again , say selling america out again \? don mckenzie west ryde , australia to the editor each new fumble by donald trumps team brings me schadenfreude yet i know that president obama , hillary clinton and others are right his success is now our success , and i should wish him well just not there yet harry brod cedar falls , iowa

barack obamas two victories created the impression of a strong wind at the back of the democratic party its constituencies the young , the nonwhite , the college educated were not only growing but were also voting in increasing numbers the age old issue of voter turnout finally seemed to be helping the political left the longer view is starting to look quite different , however none of the other three most recent democratic presidential nominees hillary clinton , john kerry and al gore inspired great turnout george w bush , as you may recall , was widely considered to have won the political ground game in off year elections , democratic turnout is even spottier , which helps explain the republican dominance of congress , governors mansions and state legislatures since donald trumps shocking victory , much of the political diagnosis has focused on white working class swing voters , and for good reason across the industrial midwest , white voters who had supported obama and previous democrats abandoned the party for trump the role that turnout played has been harder to figure out in the initial days after the election , some people focused on the total number of votes cast , which appeared much lower than four years ago that impression was wrong , though , because a few million absentee and mail ballots had not yet been counted out west in the end , overall turnout in 2016 wont have changed much from 2012 yet its also becoming clear that turnout really was an important part of the 2016 story and addressing it is crucial to the democrats comeback plans in the simplest terms , republican turnout seems to have surged this year , while democratic turnout stagnated the republican surge is easiest to see in those same heartland states that flipped the election douglas rivers , the chief scientist at yougov , a research firm , has done an analysis focused on the returns in six states five that switched from obama to trump , and minnesota , which trump barely lost in these states , turnout rose more in conservative areas than in liberal ones that pattern , obviously , cannot be explained by vote switching among the white working class in counties where trump won at least 70 percent of the vote , the number of votes cast rose 2 9 percent versus 2012 trumps pugnacious message evidently stirred people who hadnt voted in the past by comparison , in counties where clinton won at least 70 percent , the vote count was 1 7 percent lower this year pennsylvania is a good example the states southern strip stretches from distant suburbs of pittsburgh through the appalachian mountains and interstate 76 , ending in lancaster county , not far from philadelphia its solidly republican territory , even in a normal year this year , the number of votes cast in the counties along that strip rose almost 10 percent relative to 2012 in pennsylvanias big cities and the labor union stronghold of allentown , the vote count rose only a few percent in addition to analyzing these publicly available numbers , yougov has also conducted polling that points in the same direction for every one voter nationwide who reported having voted for obama in 2012 and trump in 2016 , at least five people voted for trump after not having voted four years ago clinton attracted substantially fewer 2012 nonvoters , the data show on net , trumps gains among nonvoters mattered more than his gains from vote switchers , rivers says one of the sillier aspects of postelection analysis is the notion that any one factor determined the result , and i want to be clear that im not suggesting as much still , the swing of white working class voters was undeniably crucial to that point , craig gilbert , of the milwaukee journal sentinel , has noted that large swaths of wisconsin have now been carried by obama , trump , republican governor scott walker and democratic senator tammy baldwin the turnout contrast also doesnt answer how influential was james comeys misguided october letter about clintons email her campaign believes it depressed her turnout and lifted trumps , and it may well have either way , though , turnout is a problem for democrats that will persist long after this election many strong democratic constituencies like young voters , latinos and asian americans have relatively low turnout rates african american turnout has trailed white turnout when obama was not on the ballot obama , for his part , has long had a minor obsession with the democrats popularity among nonvoters hopefully , its a reminder that elections matter and voting counts , he said after trumps win i dont know how many times we have to relearn this lesson , because we ended up having 43 percent of the country not voting who were eligible to vote what can the party do about it \? for starters , it should continue to fight hard for voting rights doing so puts it on the right side of history and also helps the party tactically there is a reason that republican officials have been trying to restrict voting hours and eligibility many of them are afraid of high turnout the republicans new political dominance will make the fight harder , but it must continue second , the democrats should recommit themselves to old fashioned organizing without giving up on the emerging science of voter turnout academic researchers have learned a lot in the last decade about voter behavior and turnout tactics there is much more to learn , as this years disappointment makes clear the ubiquity of social media and smartphones creates opportunities to get more people to vote finally , the democrats should remember that inspiring turnout and persuading swing voters arent separate problems its a lot easier to do both with a galvanizing message that makes voters feel part of
hamburg , germany so far , the german response to donald j trumps election has been predictable , and predictably loud politicians and pundits are rattling on about how europe needs to bolster its defenses , speeches they have been giving for years the doomsayers have a point , of course president elect trump has repeatedly called into question article 5 of the nato agreement , the promise to regard an attack on one of its members as an attack on all and he has demanded that europe , and the rest of americas allies , start paying more for his countrys defensive umbrella hes not the first to say it leading american politicians have repeatedly told their counterparts over here that the days of american generosity in burden sharing will soon be over barack obama said it hillary clinton said it in a 2011 speech in brussels , robert m gates , then the secretary of defense , said , future u s political leaders those for whom the cold war was not the formative experience that it was for me may not consider the return on americas investment in nato worth the cost and why wouldnt americans rethink their commitment \? the disparity in spending is enormous in 2015 , the european union states , with their 550 million citizens , spent 217 billion on defense , while the united states , with its 320 million people , spent 560 billion even the ukraine crisis , and the possibility of russian expansion toward eastern europe , have led to just a few minor increases in military spending germanys recent pledge to spend an additional 8 6 billion on its armed forces between now and 2019 still brings its military expenditures to just 1 2 percent of gross domestic product far from natos requirement that members devote 2 percent of their gross domestic product to defense but for all the postelection chatter in berlin and elsewhere on the continent , the truth is that trump shock or not major investments in defense wont happen here anytime soon europe is just not in the mood for it , neither economically nor politically to make things worse , at the heart of the foreign policy debate in both the german and the french national elections next year will be relations with russia the campaigns will be a battle between alleged peace lovers versus alleged irresponsible putin warmonger provocateurs germanys social democrats will try to capitalize on the fear of war by demanding rapprochement with russia in france , the nationalist marine le pen will go even further , pushing for a cultural alliance with mr putins empire as an emancipation from the brussels establishment rule politics aside , even if , against all odds , the europeans could decide on major investments in ships , planes and military technology , it would take decades to procure all the hardware we need to consider other avenues to self protection in fact , the best option may be right in front of us lease capacity from the united states the hardware is already in our territory , on navy , air force and army bases scattered across europe , and in staging warehouses along natos eastern borders instead of letting the americans withdraw it and replacing it with our own matriel , why not , in effect , rent it from them \? america has a global military base network , high tech special forces , drones and cutting edge satellites not to mention six fleets and 11 aircraft carrier strike groups but does it need it all \? and can it afford it all \? or has the united states invested too much hope in the power of steel in the past 15 years \? most probably , it has europe , in comparison , has only one full size aircraft carrier , frances charles de gaulle , but this can accommodate only french fighter planes italy and spain have one carrier each , but they are suited only for vertical takeoffs britain is assembling two carriers , but by the time they are ready , the country will probably have left the european union does europe need more steel if it wants to underpin its soft power with military strength \? might this be a reason the continent is not even part of the syria negotiations in geneva \? absolutely , yes europe has borrowed american muscle before in 1941 , after winston churchill pleaded for help in fighting nazi germany , franklin d roosevelt signed the lend lease agreement under this deal , the united states supplied britain and other allied nations with vessels , warplanes and weaponry of all kinds in return , the united states was given a right to use other countries military bases , mostly on british controlled territory in europe , africa and asia the policy helped the allies win the war , and the united states become the successor to the british empire sure , europe has no empire on offer today but it could offer the united states money and breathing space americans want a break from their nations role as the sole global policeman and would like to spend more on public investment in infrastructure and education the united states shoulders an extremely unfair military burden while at the same time loading its youth with student loan debt this is neither fair nor forward looking cant we , the west , strike a new deal here \? lets call it the steel for school agreement
narva , estonia barely a few hundred yards inside natos jittery eastern border with russia , a high school teacher asked students in his social studies class this week to address a topic of paramount importance for their future the election of donald j trump as the next president of the united states mr trumps surprising victory has sent shock waves around the world , but the possible consequences are particularly acute here in the baltics , a region long seen as a potential flash point because of its physical , linguistic and cultural proximity to russia if world war iii starts , we will be the first to know about it , said one of the students in the 12th grade class who , in keeping with school policy , gave only his first name , nikita odd though it may seem , in view of the threat that a newly aggressive russia may pose , he and many other students in this russian speaking town welcomed mr trumps victory because , they said , the billionaire wanted to cut a deal with moscow and calm tensions jurgen , another student in the class , described hillary clinton , the democratic candidate , as a menace because she wants war with russia , adding trump wants friendship in a war , we would be just in the way such views , widespread in russian speaking communities in the baltics and beyond , contrast starkly with the alarm , even panic , at mr trumps triumph among an estonian speaking political and foreign policy elite in the countrys capital , tallinn , where russias president , vladimir v putin , is viewed as a threat who must be resisted , not appeased during the campaign , mr trump raised alarms in baltic capitals by calling nato obsolete and questioning why the united states should defend alliance members that fail to shoulder their share of the costs but president obama has said that mr trump assured him during their oval office meeting last week that he remained committed to the security guarantees that have underpinned natos system of collective defense and peace in europe since 1949 but the baltic states remain on edge mr trump demonstrated a mercurial streak during the campaign , and they are the most at risk if he should change his mind again and decide to back away from nato adding to their worries , pro kremlin politicians just scored gains in elections in bulgaria and moldova yet the reaction to mr trumps victory in estonia and neighboring latvia , which also has a large russian population , is complex , a reflection of their tangled ethnic , cultural and political situation even as political leaders in tallinn and the latvian capital , riga , are in shock , many ethnic russians see a silver lining , hoping that a trump presidency can improve relations with russia tanel mazur , the teacher of the class in narva , said that around a third of his students were of russian descent , a third estonian and a third from mixed families , but that they defied easy labels all speak estonian , which is used in class english and russian , the dominant language in narva not all of his students cheered mr trump , and several , including one with a russian background , said they worried that he might encourage trouble by trying to appease mr putin asked what they wanted from mr trump now that he had been elected leader of the free world , one student said he must keep his emotions back another said he should make america great again , while the class joker advised that mr trump change his hair to be taken seriously mr mazur , who teaches in estonian and stayed up late on election night to follow the results , said he never liked mrs clinton much but added that she at least had a much clearer message and you knew what to expect , more or less mr trump , by contrast , has said so many different things , nobody knows what he really wants to do adding to the uncertainty and alarm are statements by some of mr trumps supporters , like newt gingrich , who described estonia as the suburbs of st petersburg and not worth a confrontation with russia that could risk nuclear war mr gingrich is now a long shot candidate for secretary of state the idea that our country is just a suburb of st petersburg is a nightmare for every estonian , said eerik niiles kross , a member of estonias parliament and the countrys former intelligence coordinator mr trumps election , he added , has sent a shiver through the whole region because it reopened security questions that were thought to have been closed with the expansion of nato more than 10 years ago ojars kalnins , the chairman of the foreign relations committee in the parliament of neighboring latvia , said mr gingrichs comments about estonia were unfortunate , to put it mildly it is one thing to talk about having a dialogue with russia , but to question the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country is outrageous , mr kalnins said yet he added that profound worry over mr trumps intentions has calmed somewhat because the president elect has pulled back from statements he made on the campaign trail in an effort to head off any weakening of american support for the baltic states , mr kalnins and a group of fellow legislators from latvia , estonia and lithuania will travel to washington early next month to press their case to the senate majority leader , mitch mcconnell , and others who might help influence mr trump we abhor unpredictability and confusion , said juri luik , a former estonian defense minister and foreign minister we are a small country and like a lot of predictability
march trilogyby john lewis , andrew aydin and nate powellillustrated 560 pp top shelf productions 49 99 black lives matter is the cry of the new civil rights movement , a slogan so broadly and willfully misunderstood that marchers often shout an addendum this is what democracy looks like the implication is that americans have forgotten , and it just might be true in the half century since mass protest ended jim crow and expanded the franchise to millions , the civil rights legacy has become a sort of catechism its images of nonviolent confrontation have been blurred into a vision of dignified compliance , and its contentious activism into the predestined evolution of the american way the result is a picture of democracy domesticated by remembrance , fixed as the granite likeness of the rev dr martin luther king jr in washingtons west potomac park there are few people better qualified to remind us of what democracy really looks like than john lewis , the georgia congressman , civil rights icon and , most recently , the author , with the writer andrew aydin and the artist nate powell , of a three part graphic memoir called march a galvanizing account of his coming of age in the movement , its a capsule lesson in courage of conscience , a story that inspires without moralizing or simplifying in hindsight the trilogys title is season , setting and imperative march begins and draws to a close with scenes from the march lewis led in selma , ala , on march 7 , 1965 , forever known as bloody sunday after state troopers and the local police attacked the nonviolent protesters the opening panels depict the marchers gathered at the edmund pettus bridge , then move from their tense , prayerful faces to the phalanx of billy clubs and white helmets on the opposite bank lewis , then only 25 , was beaten that day five months later , lyndon johnson signed the voting rights act the three volumes of march \( the second won an eisner award at comic con , and the third won this years national book award for young peoples literature \) arent just a record of lewiss activism but one of its brilliant examples , designed to help new generations of readers visualize the possibilities of political engagement the model is martin luther king and the montgomery story , a 16 page comic about the montgomery bus boycott that begins with a young martin luther king jr in church like most effective lessons , march is the story of an education , an introduction to the difficult art of principled dissent or , as lewis has called it , necessary trouble the three books recount major events of the civil rights movement from lewiss position as a leader and later the chairman of the student nonviolent coordinating committee the first volume encompasses his childhood in rural alabama , his religious education and his involvement with the sit ins protesting nashvilles segregated businesses after enduring harassment , beatings and incarceration , the students triumph from their efforts emerges sncc later victories come at a high cost book 2 centers on the freedom rides protesting segregation in interstate transportation , which are met with bombings , bus burnings , mob attacks and the mass imprisonment of riders at mississippis state penitentiary , parchman farm danger impels division when dr king declines to join sncc organizers on the buses , some mock him by calling him de lawd backstage at the 1963 march on washington , lewis , the events youngest and most radical speaker , is criticized for questioning the proposed civil rights legislation lewiss address , so often eclipsed by kings , punctuates the second volume , recasting this capstone event for a generation less certain of the endurance of its message march is more movement blueprint than civil rights monument , avoiding the old testament spectacle of good versus evil in favor of the clashing visions and fractious passions of those pledged to the same fight as in ava duvernays film selma , the spotlight is on strategic thinking and organization politics the choreography behind moments whose seminal status has become , at least for present day figures whose activism is measured by its yardstick , a hindrance the graphic novel genre proves to be the perfect means of showing us the friction at the movements seams vivid and dynamic , yet easily accommodating political nuance , this form lends itself to depicting the complex confrontations and negotiations of a wide range of individuals nate powells illustrations shine in the testimony of fannie lou hamer , a mississippi sharecropper who was arrested , beaten and tortured by the police after attempting to register to vote hamers speech at the 1964 democratic national convention in atlantic city serves as the fulcrum for the third volumes account of the freedom summer she was attending as a leader of the mississippi freedom democratic party , organized to challenge the states segregated delegation for its seats her nationally televised address , confidently delivered as an indictment of americas character , was so alarming to lyndon johnson that he interrupted the broadcast with an improvised news conference hamers speech zigzags like a thunderbolt across the panels as they sketch the shocked audiences journalists in the convention ballroom , ordinary families watching at home , president johnson plotting his countermove from the oval office its hard to imagine a better medium for representing a movement so defined by its rapid and sophisticated manipulation of publicity in a year when black demonstrators have been beaten at rallies for donald trump and denounced for interrupting bernie sanders and hillary clinton , the emphasis on hamer and the freedom democratic party resonates while march doesnt extend beyond its triumphal framing story , the morning of barack obamas first inauguration , it speaks to an era defined by blacklivesmatter

campaign promises are easy governing is hard it is a truism that donald j trump and his team will soon learn and a fascinating example has emerged since the election , courtesy of global currency markets it is a study in the kind of complex trade offs that mr trump rarely grappled with during his campaign but will face many times a day in the oval office a centerpiece of mr trumps campaign was the united states trade deficits he pledged to eliminate them and create a resurgence in american manufacturing he has also pledged tax cuts , infrastructure spending and deregulation that set of policies has led markets to expect speedier economic growth and thus higher interest rates in coming years that , in turn , is driving the value of the dollar higher since election day , the dollar is up 3 6 percent against an index of six other major currencies the value of the mexican peso has fallen 11 percent against the dollar , a remarkable swing for the united states third largest trading partner you dont need to be an economist to see what that means a pricier dollar makes it harder for american manufacturers to compete overseas it gives an advantage to companies that locate operations elsewhere and it will , all else being equal , tend to make the trade deficit higher rather than lower this is not to suggest that the shift in the currency so far is a major disaster for american manufacturers and other exporters \( though those that ship their goods to mexico will feel the brunt of it \) there was a bigger rise in the dollar in 2014 and 2015 that damaged export sectors even more but lets imagine that mr trump follows through on the policy mix hes hinted at so far a combination of loose fiscal policy \( think more spending on defense and infrastructure , and tax cuts \) and tighter monetary policy \( the federal reserve raising interest rates faster than had seemed likely before the election \) at that point , the dollar could move decisively higher , creating a tension that the president and his advisers would have to resolve one way or the other as a rule of thumb , said joseph gagnon , a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics , a 10 percent rise in the dollar would be expected to increase the current account deficit \( a broader concept than trade deficit , but closely related \) by 1 to 1 5 percent of g d p in the ensuing two to three years in that case , mr trumps pledge to eliminate the 500 billion united states trade deficit would have just become 180 billion to 270 billion harder this is the kind of dilemma presidents face all the time the oval office debate might go something like this the commerce secretary complains , mr president , this strong dollar is just killing our manufacturers they cant compete with this kind of appreciation the treasury secretary , who is in charge of the currency , responds , its a necessary evil , mr president our economy is booming so much that global investors just cant get enough of united states assets when there are these kinds of disputes , the president has to decide and when a president tries to find a solution that answers both concerns , there are always complex ripples for example , lets appoint fed officials who will cut interest rates might temporarily let you have both a booming domestic economy and a competitive export sector , but would mean an increase in inflation which will make both the bond market and many retired americans living on fixed incomes unhappy the tension between currency policy and trade policy is just one example mr trumps promises to repeal obamacare while keeping some of its most popular features would be hard to carry out in practice virtually every issue in tax policy , diplomacy and regulatory policy features similar complex trade offs none of this is to say that these tensions are unsolvable , or that mr trump wont overcome his lack of a policy background to arrive at good solutions but he will almost certainly find out that make america great again is a slogan , not an answer
this article is part of the opinion today newsletter you can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox top democrats did their best to clear the field for hillary clinton in 2016 and left themselves with a problem they didnt see coming their nominee was deeply out of step with the electorates mood in hindsight , the distaste for establishment candidates is this years clearest theme jeb bush , scott walker and marco rubio all flamed out a self identified socialist who hadnt previously even been a member of the democratic party won almost 45 percent of primary votes last week , voters in most states rejected the highly experienced clinton for a man who will soon be the least experienced president in american history there is no question that the democrats now have a thin field of national leaders but that thinness has an upside the party cant repeat the mistake of 2016 rather than anointing a leader only to find that leader out of step with the electorate , the democrats will have to go through more of a bottom up process elected democrats and 2018 candidates will have a chance to try out themes and arguments and see which resonate radically different as they are , both barack obama and donald trump made stunning ascents to the white house in precisely that way elizabeth warren and bernie sanders are the most obvious democrats who will have a chance to shape the partys message chuck schumer and other congressional leaders will , too but they should have a lot of company , including from people who are less famous today four years is a long time another democrat who deserves a hearing is one of the relatively few to have run successful populist campaigns lately sherrod brown , ohios senior senator he has an op ed in this mornings times about the dignity of work and about trade and tax policies that create immense affluence at the top and take wealth from workers
boston millions of americans suffer from alcoholism or addiction to legal and illegal drugs , but only a fraction are being treated , according to a report released on thursday by the surgeon general one in seven people in the united states is expected to develop a substance use disorder at some point , the report said but as of now , only one in 10 will receive treatment the report is the first from a surgeon general to address substance use disorders and the wider range of health problems related to alcohol and drugs it calls for , among other things , a cultural change in understanding that addiction is a brain disease , not a character flaw its time to change how we view addiction , dr vivek h murthy , the surgeon general , said in releasing the report not as a moral failing but as a chronic illness that must be treated with skill , urgency and compassion the way we address this crisis is a test for america the report is intended to try to prompt the public , policy makers and health care professionals to better address these issues those who work in the fields of addiction and recovery liken it to the landmark surgeon general reports of the 1950s and 1960s that said smoking caused lung cancer and led congress in 1965 to require health warnings on cigarette packs but it is not clear that this report will be nearly as influential for one , at least one senator is calling it a missed opportunity the deaths caused by prescription drug , heroin and fentanyl overdoses are growing exponentially every year , yet this report fails to provide any detailed road map for how best to curb opioid addiction , senator edward j markey , democrat of massachusetts , said in a statement the magnitude of the opioid epidemic , he said , demanded a far more detailed discussion in addition , the report comes at the tail end of the obama administration , which pleaded unsuccessfully with congress this year for 1 billion to fight the opioid epidemic congress instead set aside 181 million , a move that a disappointed president obama said was better than nothing and it comes as the incoming president , donald j trump , prepares to appoint his own surgeon general and has his own ideas about how to combat the epidemic mr trump has said that he will try everything we can to get americans unaddicted to drugs , but his chief proposal is to build a wall on the border with mexico the wall , he said in new hampshire last month , would keep out drug dealers and keep out the heroin poisoning our youth even if a wall kept some heroin out of the united states , it would not necessarily solve the problem while many americans are dying of overdoses of heroin , many more are dying from opioid painkillers legally prescribed within the united states and in some states , deaths from synthetic opioids like fentanyl , which are coming from china , are overtaking deaths from heroin on a conference call , dr murthy was asked how mr trumps plans to roll back the affordable care act might affect his call to action on substance abuse the issue of addiction affects everyone regardless of political party , race , ethnicity or socioeconomic status , he said , adding that the effort to combat the drug epidemic has been bipartisan the urgency to address addiction is only growing , dr murthy said he vowed to continue his work to change how were talking about addiction and get people to step forward and ask for help the new report said that 78 people die every day in the united states from opioid overdoses , a number that has nearly quadrupled since 1999 it estimated that the annual economic toll related to alcohol is 249 billion and that the toll related to drugs is 193 billion the majority of people who misuse substances do not develop a use disorder , the report said but roughly one in seven americans 14 6 percent of the population are expected to develop such a disorder at some point only about 10 percent of people with a substance use disorder receive any type of specialty treatment , the report said and while more than 40 percent of people with such a disorder also have a mental health condition , fewer than half receive treatment for either from 40 percent to 70 percent of a persons risk for developing a substance use disorder is genetic , the report said , but many environmental factors like how old he or she is when first drinking or trying drugs can influence the risk people who first drink alcohol before age 15 are four times more likely to become addicted at some time in their lives than are those who have their first drink at age 20 or older , the report said nearly 70 percent of those who try an illicit drug before the age of 13 develop a substance use disorder within seven years , the report said , compared with 27 percent of those who first try an illicit drug after the age of 17
donald j trumps victory could well push the american party system toward a clash between an overwhelmingly white ethnic party and a cosmopolitan coalition of minority groups and college educated whites despite the unexpected result , mr trump lost the popular vote in an election that in some respects closely resembled barack obamas victory over mitt romney in 2012 an ordinary end to a very abnormal campaign the power of party identification held approximately 90 percent of republicans in mr trumps camp however , mr trumps campaign may set in motion a process that reorients american politics toward the cosmopolitanism versus nationalism divide that he emphasized , reconfiguring our party system and shaping our politics for decades to come the power of social identity suggests that such a dynamic could be difficult to stop once set in motion in recent years , the democrats and republicans have battled along a liberal conservative axis of conflict that emphasizes disagreement over the size and scope of government rather than divisive disputes about racial identity during the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections , for instance , john mccain and mr romney ran against mr obamas domestic policy proposals on issues like health care and the economy after 2012 , the republican party hoped to continue along this path and expand its appeal to young people , minorities and women but as the political scientists gary miller and norm schofield note , candidates and parties sometimes engage in flanking moves so as to enlist coalitions of disaffected voters by changing positions on social issues that cut across party lines , they seek to attract voters who are only loosely attached to the other party mr trump seems to have pulled off one of these maneuvers in shifting from traditional conservatism to a kind of race inflected nationalism though the move cost him votes among college educated whites , he attracted support among the larger group of whites without a college degree \( a substantial minority of whom had backed mr obama in 2012 \) , pulling in just enough votes in the rust belt to tip the election despite all the attention paid to economic anxiety as the basis for mr trumps appeal , the evidence to date is more consistent with his brand of identity politics being the most important cause of this shift in voting patterns from 2012 \( though of course economic anxiety and group animus are not mutually exclusive \) mr trumps approach has the potential to transform the party system first , the success of his campaign may encourage other republicans to adopt his model he has shown that the penalty for deviating from orthodox policies is minimal and that an ethno nationalist style can have significant electoral advantages second , though presidents cannot impose their will on most of domestic policy , they can help define the issues on the political agenda in the choices that he makes , mr trump may play down conflict over the size and scope of government and shift the political debate toward questions of national identity , immigration and culture finally , few republicans are likely to want to cross mr trump and his energized supporters given the threat of a potential primary challenge in 2018 consider , for instance , mr trumps decision to name as his chief strategist steve bannon , the head of breitbart , a website described in an article in the conservative national review as catering to a small but vocal fringe of white supremacists , anti semites and internet trolls though the move lacked recent precedent , no republicans in congress objected , which made the issue into a partisan dispute with democrats mr trump has also stirred emotions by promising to deport two to three million undocumented immigrants by contrast , the fate of a tax cut normally the top g o p domestic policy priority has received less attention \( though the party will almost certainly pursue one \) mr trumps success is likely to provoke a response from democrats that could accelerate this shift they face an outraged liberal base that is likely to reject conciliatory messages intended to win back votes among the white working class the party might instead double down on cosmopolitan appeals to the minority voters and college educated white voters who were the main target of hillary clintons campaign the strategy failed in 2016 , but the incentive to try again is clear democrats came closer to winning several sun belt states where minority and college educated white populations are growing , like arizona and georgia , than they did some traditional midwest strongholds with higher numbers of noncollege whites , like ohio and iowa a focus on cosmopolitanism might make electoral sense for democrats given the changing demographics of the country , but it could further weaken their appeal to whites without college degrees , dividing the electorate by race and class even more nothing about this process is preordained , of course republicans may yet succeed in steering mr trump toward a traditional g o p agenda of tax cuts and deregulation but the effects he could have on americas party system could be of far more lasting consequence than almost any policy he might propose

washington lurking behind the turmoil and the jockeying for advantage in president elect donald j trumps effort to assemble a national security team lies the more fundamental question of how he will address the immediate and complex challenges he inherits upon taking office mr trump has never articulated any detailed foreign policy vision beyond the vague slogan america first the diverse and shifting cast of potential appointees under consideration for top administration jobs has only highlighted the deep splits among conservatives about how the new administration should confront fast evolving threats involving iran , north korea , syria and russia , among others , and how it should manage relations with allies in europe and asia im america first , mr trump said in a march interview with the new york times , describing for the first time what the phrase meant to him we have been disrespected , mocked and ripped off for many , many years by people that were smarter , shrewder , tougher now , from his personnel appointments to his first major meeting with a foreign leader it came thursday in new york , with prime minister shinzo abe of japan mr trump faces a series of decisions that will begin to flesh out his approach to the world and provide some clue as to how he might respond to whatever crises confront him as commander in chief does america first mean he will use americas military and cyberpower pre emptively , to wipe out emerging threats , from rogue nuclear states to terrorist groups , before they can do harm to the united states \? or does it mean he calls americas forward deployed troops back home , building them into a defensive , retaliatory force that can lash out if the nation is attacked \? at moments during the campaign , he suggested both approaches he said he would take the oil from islamic state controlled areas of iraq , and he criticized president obama for pulling troops out too soon but he is also the man who rejected nation building and asked , why is it always the united states that gets right in the middle of things \? he added , at some point , we cannot be the policeman of the world no one knows what response to expect from mr trump , a man who said he prided himself on following his instincts and has little patience for careful legalisms of his predecessor but while presidents change , the challenges do not here are some places and issues where america first will first take shape mr trump called the agreement reached with iran in july 2015 , intended to constrain tehran from building nuclear weapons , one of the most incompetent deals of any kind ive ever seen , and he promised to fix it because the iran deal is an executive agreement , not a treaty , the new president has great latitude to alter or scrap it but two can play that game the iranians are deeply unhappy with the accord , too , arguing that they never got the relief from sanctions that they were promised any effort to reopen the bargaining will also give irans mullahs , military officers and conservatives a chance to alter the pact or threaten to resume their race for nuclear capability to mr trump , the iran deal was not only misguided , but also badly negotiated they shouldve walked , he said of secretary of state john kerry and his negotiating team mr trump said he would have left the negotiating room , doubled down on sanctions , and never agreed to give back billions of dollars , money that belonged to iran and was frozen in american financial institutions but when pressed , he struggled to name any part of the deal he would have walked out of the negotiations to alter with some prompting , he finally settled on a common critique that after 15 years , iran will be free to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium again , in any quantity in america first terms , mr trumps decision about what to do with the iran deal will be an early test of his willingness to act unilaterally the nations that joined the united states in the negotiations britain , france , russia and china not only support the deal , but are rushing to take economic advantage of it by building commercial ties with iran if mr trump wanted to abandon the deal or reimpose sanctions , they would almost certainly refuse to go along the iranians hold a few cards , too in january they shipped 98 percent of their nuclear fuel out of the country , disabled a plutonium reactor and took thousands of centrifuges , which enrich uranium , out of service if the deal were to be declared dead , they would be free to re create their nuclear infrastructure and rebuild their stockpile , now frozen until 2030 by obama administration estimates , it would take about a year for them to produce enough new material for a weapon longer to produce the weapon itself one option for mr trump , advocated by many republicans , is to simply reimpose sanctions on iran for non nuclear reasons , including its activities in syria and its continued support of terrorism the iranians would say that violates the spirit of the agreement and irans leadership has already threatened that such action would nullify it it is hard to say which has sounded more confrontational in recent years about north korea the obama administration , which has regularly warned of a devastating response to any north korean use of its expanding nuclear arsenal , or the republicans , who spent much of the bush years plotting ways to make the countrys regime collapse but if there is likely to be an early test of mr trumps reaction to provocations , north korea is

cleveland start with this when you call us the rust belt , you demean our work and diminish who we are to create wealth in america , we make it , we grow it or we mine it in the industrial midwest , we do all three ohio has the largest manufacturing work force in the country aside from california \( which has three times our population \) and texas \( more than twice our size \) and we make things with dignity many years ago , as a state representative , i spent countless hours at united steelworkers local 169 in mansfield , a small industrial city north of columbus i would listen to workers who stopped in at the hall before or after their shifts i learned how they made steel and how they built cars i learned that strikes are always an act of back against the wall desperation because workers never make up for the wages lost , no matter how good the new contract is or how briefly they are on the picket line they worked hard most gladly accepted six day workweeks because of the overtime pay most of these workers , especially those lucky enough to carry a union card , had a shot at upward mobility they owned modest houses , they could buy new cars every four or five years , and they could send their children to the local ohio state campus or to north central technical college few of these workers , white or black , expected to have the opportunities i had as a doctors kid but they understood intuitively that their daughter at johnny appleseed junior high could have more than they did their goal to achieve the american dream and send their children up the economic ladder was more difficult for them to reach than it was for my parents more things could go wrong for them a layoff , a strike , a work injury , an illness in the family , each coming with more devastating consequences than those life deals out to more affluent white families i learned about the role circumstance played in success where you were born , how much education and income your parents had , what neighborhood you lived in , what school you attended at the union hall , we often discussed books , articles and news about strikes and heroes of the labor movement they were novels like wallace stegners joe hill and john steinbecks grapes of wrath that tell the very real stories of the lives of american workers , stories that too many in washington have forgotten or ignored for far too long as the rev dr martin luther king jr taught us , all work has dignity and importance , whether done by a street sweeper , michelangelo or beethoven people take pride in the things they make , in serving their communities in hospitals or schools , in making their contribution to society with a job well done but over the past 40 years , as people have worked harder for less pay and fewer benefits , the value of their work has eroded when we devalue work , we threaten the pride and dignity that come from it american workers understood then and understand now that you build a society and an economy from the middle class out trickle down economics was discredited decades ago workers paid good wages are also good consumers , which means companies can sell more of their products executives have always been paid well , but nothing close to the 300 to 1 pay ratio separating chief executives from workers today most americans have always wanted to believe that their childrens lives will be better than their own ohio workers know they toil harder and are paid less than their parents , and have less power to control the hours they work and their share of the wealth they create for their employer this diverse force feels betrayed by trade and tax policies that create immense affluence at the top and take wealth from workers much of washington and that now includes donald j trump doesnt seem to understand this ohio families will watch to see if the new president follows the billionaire agenda of the republican leadership in washington , which has called for overturning a new rule that increases overtime pay for many workers an action that would strip thousands of dollars in wages from 130 , 000 of ohios moderate income workers they will measure this president to see if he continues to oppose increasing the minimum wage , which is worth nearly 20 percent less than in 1980 workers will expect the president to keep his promise of a trade agenda that puts their jobs above corporate profits and they will scrutinize whether he will throw in with washingtons moneyed interests at the expense of middle class and working class families if president trump takes the likely path that almost all washington republicans hope tax cuts for the rich , an easing up on wall street , more voter suppression ohio workers will feel betrayed again and they will respond
one of donald trumps big advantages now is that he has so many awful associates no matter what appointees he foists on us , theres always another pal whod have been worse if he names some federal land grabbing oilman as secretary of the interior , people are going to sigh with relief and say , at least it isnt sarah palin and reince priebus until a few days ago priebus was just the head of the republican national committee , a seriously unexciting guy with a hard to pronounce name then he got picked to be white house chief of staff at the same time steve bannon , the loathsome alt right cheerleader , was named chief strategy adviser everyone fell madly in love with priebus , who was way less bad the whole world is watching the trump transition nine weeks and 3 , 998 appointments to go ! if you want to look on the bright side , remember that however horrific you feel about whats happening in washington , chris christie feels worse farewell , chris christie , farewell weve said goodbye to his political career so many times bridgegate , the ever plummeting new jersey credit rating , the time he chased a heckler down the boardwalk waving an ice cream cone the doomed presidential race the humiliating stint standing behind trump at press conferences , looking as if hed been hit on the head with a mallet then he was exiled to the trump transition when nobody actually imagined there was going to be one now its here , and hes toast it appears that trump son in law jared kushner did not actually forgive and forget that christie sent his father to jail for tax evasion being a prosecutor was one of the more righteous periods in christies life , but it turned out to be more damaging , careerwise , than his habit of screaming at schoolteachers at public meetings tweets aside , we have heard from donald trump only once this week not counting the time he went to eat at the 21 club in manhattan and promised one of the other well heeled diners a tax break he was more expansive in a 60 minutes interview , clarifying his promise to drain the swamp if he was elected many people thought he was talking about lobbyists but apparently it was just a passing reference to easing the regulations on inland wetlands thats the only people you have down there , he told lesley stahl , explaining why his transition team was stuffed with the wealthy insiders hed run his campaign against the new transition is trying to sweep them under the rug but lets hope all the working class voters in the rust belt understood that the first step to making america great again is the repeal of banking regulations meanwhile , somebody is promoting ted cruzs name for attorney general could it be ted cruz \? this is one potential nomination that would have no trouble getting confirmed , since the idea of getting cruz out of the senate would probably corral a massive vote the only person we know for sure is not going to be in the trump cabinet is ben carson , who was briefly rumored as a possible head of the department of health and human services but armstrong williams , carsons business manager , told the hill that the politician neurosurgeon had ruled that out dr carson feels he has no government experience , hes never run a federal agency , armstrong explained the world stops briefly , and mulls that this man did feel equipped to run for president then the world moves on but the biggest appointments gossip centered on rudy giulianis rather manic campaign for secretary of state everybody expected giuliani to be in the running for attorney general , but it turned out he was keen on being appointed to a post for which he had no earthly qualifications whatsoever pop quiz if rudy giuliani is nominated to a high post in the trump administration , would you rather have the debate over his confirmation center on a \) his millions and millions of dollars in speaking fees and work on behalf of everyone from qatar to the maker of oxycontin b \) the time he told reporters he was ditching his wife before he told his wife c \) the fact that on 9 11 new york city had no emergency command center because giuliani had insisted , over police objections , on putting it in the world trade center d \) his increasing resemblance to a 100 year old rabbit admit it , you want to talk about d at 72 , giuliani is the same age as john kerry , who recently broke the secretary of state record with 1 3 million miles traveled on the job but some people age badly , and giuliani has been off his game for decades he peaked around 1995 and its been a deep slide ever since among the other potential candidates for secretary of state are john bolton , the former united nations ambassador who is famous for hating the united nations bolton actually makes giuliani seem less awful and theres always sarah palin
right wing israeli politicians see donald trumps election as helpful toward their goal of burying the prospect of a palestinian state on wednesday , israeli lawmakers gave preliminary approval to a bill that would retroactively legalize settlements built on private palestinian land in the west bank the bill is intended to prevent the court ordered demolition of an illegal outpost by dec 25 prime minister benjamin netanyahu opposes the bill and attorney general avichai mandelblit has said it violates international law still , the fact that it cleared a major hurdle represents an alarming gain for pro settlement israelis education minister naftali bennett , who heads the jewish home party , the most ardent supporter of settlements , proclaimed that the era of the palestinian state is over this is at odds with the israeli governments official position , which holds out hope for a two state solution an outcome washington has sought to broker for decades on wednesday , israels defense minister , avigdor lieberman , said that the government should strike a deal with the trump administration to authorize expanded construction in the major west bank settlements any move in that direction would be misguided and dangerous for the united states one of the most effective ways that isis and other terrorist groups have attracted recruits is by tarring the united states with israels expanding occupation of the west bank , senator patrick leahy of vermont said in a statement this legislation to retroactively legalize illegal settlements will be welcomed by those murderous groups as further evidence that americas closest ally in the region is bent on destroying a peaceful solution , including the possibility of a palestinian state pro settlement israelis were particularly heartened by an interview jason greenblatt , a foreign policy adviser to mr trump , gave to israels army radio after the election , in which he said mr trump did not view the settlements as an obstacle for peace mr trumps personal views on the settlements are unclear he recently told the wall street journal that he aspired to broker the ultimate deal , to bring an end to the conflict between israel and palestinians , for humanitys sake if that is indeed his aspiration , he should immediately signal to the israelis not to mention his advisers that he will need time and consultation to develop a coherent policy on the region absent such a signal , the right wing in israel will be further encouraged to forge ahead with a new and dangerous expansion of settlements
berlin my organization , wikileaks , took a lot of heat during the run up to the recent presidential election we have been accused of abetting the candidacy of donald j trump by publishing cryptographically authenticated information about hillary clintons campaign and its influence over the democratic national committee , the implication being that a news organization should have withheld accurate , newsworthy information from the public the obama justice department continues to pursue its six year criminal investigation of wikileaks , the largest known of its kind , into the publishing of classified documents and articles about the wars in iraq and afghanistan , guantnamo bay and mrs clintons first year as secretary of state according to the trial testimony of one f b i agent , the investigation includes several of wikileaks founders , owners and managers and last month our editor , julian assange , who has asylum at ecuadors london embassy , had his internet connection severed i can understand the frustration , however misplaced , from clinton supporters but the wikileaks staff is committed to the mandate set by mr assange , and we are not going to go away , no matter how much he is abused thats something that democrats , along with everyone who believes in the accountability of governments , should be happy about despite the mounting legal and political pressure coming from washington , we continue to publish valuable material , and submissions keep pouring in there is a desperate need for our work the world is connected by largely unaccountable networks of power that span industries and countries , political parties , corporations and institutions wikileaks shines a light on these by revealing not just individual incidents , but information about entire structures of power while a single document might give a picture of a particular event , the best way to shed light on a whole system is to fully uncover the mechanisms around it the hierarchy , ideology , habits and economic forces that sustain it it is the trends and details visible in the large archives we are committed to publishing that reveal the details that tell us about the nature of these structures it is the constellations , not stars alone , that allow us to read the night sky there are two contradictory myths about how we operate on one hand , that we simply dump whatever comes to us into the publics arms and on the other , that we pick and choose material to harm our alleged political enemies we do neither yes , we believe in the integrity of source material , in the value of conserving pristine collections of documents , and we strive to make this historical record accessible to the public we publish in full , in an uncensored and uncensorable fashion but we also research , validate and contextualize the submissions we receive while it can be difficult to balance the needs of the public to have timely access to large archives with individual privacy , such concerns have mostly been disingenuous at times we receive individual documents , but we have come to specialize in large collections over the last decade we have vetted , indexed and published an average of 3 , 000 documents per day , including over 300 , 000 reports covering the wars in iraq and afghanistan , more than two million emails from syrian political figures and over 120 , 000 documents from the saudi arabian ministry of foreign affairs we also curate the public library of united states diplomacy , the worlds largest collection of diplomatic cables \( nearly three million \) wikileaks has transformed more than 10 million documents into a unique searchable archive , not only making our website the worlds largest online library for suppressed information , but also enabling greater contextualization through relationships across publications some have accused us of being pawns of the russian government , but this misrepresents our principles and basic operations wikileaks relies on our editors invention of a secure anonymous online submission system to protect sources identities this technology has become a standard for many media outlets around the world we prefer not to know who our sources are we do not want to , and usually do not need to what matters to us is the authenticity of the documents this has always been our position and approach , whether we were publishing material about the george w bush administrations wars or corruption within the democratic party the establishment media was happy to work with us on the former , but turned against us when it came to the latter , calling into question our intentions and those of mr assange cnn has even suggested , wrongly , that readers may have legal troubles if they download documents from our site while we have no institutional bias and can publish only what we receive , we are happy to publish documents about any presidential candidate , at any time , anywhere for a globally significant election we publish without fear or favor , bringing transparency to powerful factions and secretive institutions , not taking any sides except that of the truth we believe in the democratization of information and the power that knowledge gives to people to further peace , accountability and self determination wikileaks will continue publishing , enforcing transparency where secrecy is the norm while threats against our editor are mounting , mr assange is not alone , and his ideas continue to inspire us and people around the world
prime minister shinzo abe of japan is planning to sit down with donald j trump in new york on thursday , in what would be the president elects first meeting with a foreign leader since his election mr abe wants to find out how serious mr trump was during his campaign when he repeatedly criticized japan on trade issues and for not paying more of the cost of its own defense and since the japanese establishment was expecting hillary clinton to win the presidency , mr abe wants to assure mr trump that he is willing and eager to work with him the prime minister is concerned about mr trumps commitment to protecting japan the united states is japans most important ally , and is legally obligated to defend it against attack there are around 50 , 000 american troops stationed in japan , a powerful deterrent against the rising threat of north korea , and an increasingly assertive china during the campaign , president elect trump suggested he might withdraw american troops not without resistance from members of congress , officials at the state department , diplomats and military advisers the united states japan alliance has been in place since the end of world war ii , and has a lot of backing on both sides of the pacific ocean maybe there are signs that japan might be willing to pay or do more , but many experts contend american troops are not only defending japan but the united states own interests in asia the pentagon is budgeted to spend about 5 5 billion to support troops and bases on okinawa and elsewhere around japan this year japan is set to spend 1 8 billion to support the bases , in addition to at least 4 billion on related expenses , including compensation for the communities that host the bases and funds for relocating american troops under its constitution , which was written by american occupying forces after world war ii , japan can keep an army for defensive purposes but mr abe has said he wants to revise the constitution and expand the military in august , his government requested the latest in a series of increases in military spending japan has committed to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , and mr abe will probably remind mr trump of that on the campaign trail , mr trump decried the cost of providing a so called nuclear umbrella to allies such as japan and south korea that do not have their own nuclear arms in march , mr trump told the new york times that he was open to those countries building their own nuclear arsenals , but on twitter this week he denied having said so mr abe has reaffirmed his countrys commitment not to develop atomic weapons any move to do so would face severe public opposition in japan , the only country that has suffered a nuclear attack he has been one of the biggest enthusiasts for the trans pacific partnership or tpp , as it is known though japan was the last of a dozen pacific rim countries to join the sweeping trade pact mr trump repeatedly criticized the tpp during the presidential campaign mr abe made politically painful concessions on agricultural imports to close the deal and get japanese manufacturers tariff free access to export markets in the united states and elsewhere the trade partnership could bolster the limp economic growth rate in his country and serve as a counterweight to china , the regions fast rising superpower mr abe acknowledged after mr trumps victory that the trans pacific partnership was in a very difficult situation but his government still plans to have parliament ratify the agreement , and he has not given up on selling it to mr trump mr abe may also seek to soften mr trumps angry campaign stance , in which he accused japan of crushing the united states on trade , and manipulating its currency to gain an economic advantage mr trump says hes for free trade in principle , but wants a better deal for the united states what that means , for now , remains a mystery
washington hillary clinton held back tears on wednesday as she asked her supporters not to lose heart after a crushing election loss and to continue working for a better country i will admit coming here tonight wasnt the easiest thing for me , mrs clinton said at a gala for the childrens defense fund , where she worked as a young law student there have been a few times this past week when all i wanted to do is just to curl up with a good book , or our dogs , and never leave the house again in her first public remarks since conceding to president elect donald j trump last week , mrs clinton told the crowd she was struggling to recover from an unexpected defeat that she said had left nonwhite children and vulnerable people across the nation afraid i believe the measure of any society is how we treat our children , and as we move forward into a new and in many ways uncertain future , that must be the test for america and ourselves , mrs clinton said in a 20 minute speech no child should be afraid to go to school because theyre latino , or african american , or muslim , or because they have a disability introduced by marian wright edelman , the groups president and founder , as the peoples president and the first woman to win the popular vote , mrs clinton , who had accepted the groups invitation before the election , said she had had to overcome deep sorrow to keep the commitment but she came bearing a message of resolve i know many of you are deeply disappointed about the results of the election i am , too more than i can ever express , she said i know this isnt easy i know that over the past week , a lot of people have asked themselves whether america was the country we thought it was she implored her supporters , though , to believe in our country , fight for our values and never give up mrs clinton has stayed out of the public eye since the day after the election , but in a private call with donors over the weekend , she cast blame for her loss on the announcement by james b comey , the f b i director , that he was reviving the inquiry into her use of a private email server as secretary of state she said that decision , by thrusting the email controversy back into the news 11 days before election day , had halted her momentum in the crucial closing days of the race and prevented her from ending her campaign with an optimistic argument to voters a second letter from mr comey , clearing her two days before the election , compounded the harm to her chances , mrs clinton told the donors , feeding into a narrative that the contest was rigged and causing wavering voters , including white suburban women , to abandon her on wednesday , though , there was no talk of opportunities missed or messages muddled instead , mrs clinton was regretful and the slightest bit defiant she said she wished she could go back in time and tell her mother , abandoned at a young age , not to despair look at me and listen , mrs clinton said she would have told her mother , her voice thick with emotion you will survive you will have a family of your own , three children , and as hard as it might be to imagine , your daughter will grow up to be a united states senator , represent our country as secretary of state and win more than 62 million votes in her campaign for the presidency democrats , stunned and dejected over last weeks electoral losses , are struggling to rebuild their party , re energize supporters and determine what lessons to draw from their defeat president obama told supporters in a call on monday afternoon that he expected to be a part of that debate starting in january , when he leaves office but it is not clear what role , if any , mrs clinton plans to play the event on wednesday , a beat the odds gala honoring at risk children who have found success , was in some sense a capstone to mrs clintons life in national politics the same event in 1992 was the first public appearance she and her husband , bill clinton , made after he won the presidency
washington more than a million people have signed up for 2017 health insurance coverage on healthcare gov , and more than 300 , 000 of them selected plans in the three days after donald j trump won the presidential election , the obama administration said on wednesday about one fourth of those using the online exchange to sign up 246 , 400 people were new to the federal marketplace , and the other 761 , 800 were renewing coverage they had this year the data covered plan selections from nov 1 , the first day of the fourth annual open enrollment period , to nov 12 , for the 39 states that use the health care website federal officials said the total was 53 , 000 more than the number of selections in the first 12 days of the enrollment season last year andrew m slavitt , the acting administrator of the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services , said he was pleased with the pace of plan selections it shows that health insurance is something people want and need , he said christen linke young , the deputy director of the agency that runs the federal marketplace , said the obama administration was moving forward with planning for 2018 it is business as usual with respect to how we are talking to insurers , she said in the presidential campaign , mr trump said repeatedly that congress must completely repeal obamacare , which he described as an absolute disaster but in the last week , he indicated that he would like to preserve certain popular features of the law , including ones that guarantee access to insurance for people with pre existing conditions and that allow young adults to stay on their parents insurance until age 26 since nov 9 , the day after republicans secured control of the white house and both houses of congress , the federal marketplace has received 8 , 000 telephone calls from people wanting to know how the election would affect their insurance coverage , mr slavitt said he said the government had assured callers that nothing is changing now and in the short term republicans and democrats disagree over the law , but nobody wants to do something disruptive to consumers , he said mr slavitts agency is responsible for health programs that account for about one fourth of all federal spending , but he said he had not had any contact with mr trumps transition team for the current open enrollment period , which runs through jan 31 , the administration has declared a goal of having 13 8 million people sign up for coverage , an increase of 1 1 million over the last enrollment season major insurers have pulled out of the marketplace in many parts of the country , and premiums for many of the remaining plans have shot up but the obama administration is trying to counter those trends with the message that federal subsidies will also increase , so that the consumers share of the premium will not rise much , especially if consumers are willing to switch to less costly plans one reason for rate increases next year is that the federal government has not paid insurers as much as they were expecting to receive to help offset financial losses under the affordable care act the united states court of federal claims recently rejected a lawsuit filed by an illinois insurer , the land of lincoln mutual health insurance company , a nonprofit cooperative that had sought damages for the governments failure the ruling is ominous for insurers because many of them contend that they , too , were shortchanged , and a number have filed similar lawsuits at issue is a program intended to compensate insurers that lose substantial sums in the federal marketplace losses far exceeded expectations , and the obama administration did not have enough money to make the promised risk corridor payments judge charles f lettow of the claims court said the government had neither a statutory nor a contractual obligation to pay the company more than it did 12 6 percent of the amount lincoln was expecting for 2014 and nothing for 2015 the money was supposed to come from profitable insurers , but the government did not collect enough to pay the amounts owed to unprofitable insurers the affordable care act did not provide money to make up the difference , and no valid contract exists between the government and the land of lincoln insurance company , judge lettow said
washington after days of reports that president elect donald j trump had requested a top secret security clearance for his son in law , jared kushner , people close to mr kushner said that was not the case no such request has been made , they said on wednesday , and he will not sit in on the presidents highly classified daily intelligence briefing but should mr trump change his mind , former government officials and experts on classified information said he would have wide latitude as president to bring a family member into the most secret circles of the government the president can authorize clearance for anyone he wants , said steven aftergood , director of the project on government secrecy at the federation of american scientists its part of his commander in chief role he has broad , essentially unlimited , access in this area like anyone else , mr kushner would be subject to a background check by the f b i but the presidents authority is so broad , mr aftergood said , that he could override red flags like fraud , huge personal debt or ties to foreign governments that would disqualify other applicants mr trump said in a twitter post on wednesday that he was not seeking security clearances for his children , who he has said will run his businesses while he is in the white house but he did not address the case of mr kushner , who is married to mr trumps elder daughter , ivanka an anti nepotism law passed by congress after president john f kennedy appointed his brother robert as attorney general in 1961 would make it difficult , if not impossible , for mr kushner to take a senior position in the trump administration , according to legal experts but they said there was no prohibition on mr kushners serving as an unpaid adviser to the president if mr trump wanted to make the arrangement more formal , he could name mr kushner to the presidents intelligence advisory board , a 16 member committee that advises the president on intelligence matters and investigates the legality of intelligence operations members of the board , which dates back to dwight d eisenhower in 1956 , include former diplomats , military officers and other government officials among its current members are michle a flournoy , a former under secretary of defense who was considered the front runner to serve as defense secretary if hillary clinton had won the election wendy r sherman , a former under secretary of state who helped negotiate the iran nuclear deal and gen john abizaid , a top commander during the iraq war i know of no limitations on the presidents ability to consult private citizens about sensitive national security issues , said gregory b craig , a former white house counsel to president obama with the advisory board , he said , it happens in a more structured and formal sense mr craig noted that private citizens are routinely given clearances to handle national security assignments , like the manhattan project , or legal cases that involve classified material , as with david e kendall , the lawyer who represented gen david h petraeus when he was charged with turning over his confidential diary to his biographer and mistress if mr trump were to take any of these steps with mr kushner , however , he would be breaking with decades of practice normally , a security clearance is granted because a persons job requires access to classified information , or because of a specific assignment that involves secrets members of a presidents family do not receive clearances , even though the president may discuss sensitive topics in their presence there is no justification for top secret security clearances for members of the presidents family , said richard w painter , the chief white house ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 , who now teaches at the university of minnesota law school i dont remember laura bush or hillary clinton having a top secret clearance kellyanne conway , a senior trump adviser , brushed aside questions from reporters on wednesday about whether it was a conflict of interest for mr trumps children to play a role in his transition when they were running his businesses youre presuming that theyre doing certain things that they should not be doing , she said i mean , theyre his children , and theyve been his business colleagues for a very long time they obviously support their father as president mr kushner already occupies a singular position in his father in laws orbit he was at mr trumps side during much of his campaign and has taken a strong behind the scenes role in the transition he was behind the recent shake ups that removed gov chris christie of new jersey , former representative mike rogers and others from the transition team if he took part in the daily briefing , mr kushner would join one of the most rarefied circles in washington during mr obamas presidency , the only people regularly in the room , besides mr obama , have been the vice president , the chief of staff , the national security adviser , the national security advisers deputy , the vice presidents national security adviser and the counterterrorism adviser all hold the highest level clearance , issued by the director of national intelligence top secret sensitive compartmented information mr obamas closest political advisers , valerie jarrett and david axelrod , were never in the room and unlike many supposedly secret meetings in washington , the contents of this briefing never leaked , according to former officials in the obama administration
mexico city mexicos ministry of foreign affairs , apparently responding to promises by president elect donald j trump to step up deportations , announced a plan on wednesday to provide more protection and support for mexican immigrants in the united states and urged the mexican population to stay calm in a statement and an accompanying video , both titled we are with you , the ministry laid out an 11 point plan intended to help mexicans in the united states get accurate information about possible changes in immigration policy and avoid falling victim to abuse and fraud fellow countrymen , these are moments of uncertainty , mexicos foreign minister , claudia ruiz massieu , said in the video stay calm , do not fall to provocations and do not let yourself be deceived she added we want to inform you about possible migratory actions that could take effect starting in february the ministrys strategy promised an expansion of services offered by mexicos embassy in washington and its 50 consulates around the united states , including a 24 hour toll free consular hotline to address migration concerns and report possible fraud an increase in outreach efforts in neighborhoods with large mexican populations and more help for mexican immigrants to secure identification documents for them and for their american born children while the statements did not specifically mention mr trump or his deportation plans , mexican officials have been worried about the possibility that he might follow through on his campaign promises to step up deportations beyond even the record rates that president obama has achieved mr trumps victory has rattled the entire region on wednesday , the governments of el salvador , guatemala and honduras issued a joint statement announcing their intention to develop a unified strategy to contend with a trump administration on shared concerns like migration el salvadors foreign minister , hugo martnez , told reuters that the three countries intended to seek mexicos collaboration central america is now a bigger source of migrants than mexico , as people flee gang violence and poverty in el salvador , honduras and guatemala mr trumps deportation proposals would certainly result in the return of many central americans to countries suffering widespread poverty and crime in a television interview broadcast on sunday , mr trump said he planned to focus his deportation efforts on people that are criminal and have criminal records , estimating that this population numbered as many as three million he suggested a focus on the most serious and dangerous criminals gang members , drug dealers , he said but left the details vague his estimate contrasted with that of the obama administration , which put the number of removal criminal aliens at about 1 9 million , including undocumented immigrants as well as legal permanent residents and immigrants with temporary visas as a candidate , mr trump took specific aim at mexican immigrants but it remained unclear how many of the deportees in his promised dragnet would be mexican in 2014 , about 52 percent of the estimated 11 1 million unauthorized immigrants in the united states were mexican , according to the pew research center , and their numbers are thought to have declined since then immigrants and their advocates in the united states are worried that an acceleration of deportations could tear apart families and communities in anticipation of policy changes , community based organizations around the country are moving to help immigrants secure their footing and protect them against a possible rise in scams that often accompany changes in immigration policy for the mexican authorities , mr trumps deportation policy could also have major domestic implications in mexico , including the return of hundreds of thousands of mexicans who might struggle to find jobs in an economy already troubled by high unemployment rates mass deportations might also result in the loss of many millions of dollars in remittances for mexico
when donald j trump emerged from the haze of his surprise victory in the presidential election , one of his first calls was apparently to an early supporter , a controversial radio host and conspiracy theorist with a large following the supporter , alex jones , the host of the alex jones show and the operator of the website infowars , says he fielded a phone call on friday from the president elect , thanking mr jones for his support the call served as a reminder that mr jones , who has been repeatedly denounced in the mainstream news media , will remain someone whose support mr trump wants he was just thanking me for fighting so hard for americans , and for americanism , and thanking my listeners and supporters and to let me know that he was working really hard around the clock , mr jones said in a telephone interview this week mr jones said he urged mr trump to hold to his pledges to go after the corruption in the government , and at least remove a lot of the establishment aides to mr trump declined to respond to an email seeking comment on the phone call as a candidate , mr trump generated headlines when he appeared on mr joness texas based radio show during the republican primary contests for a nearly half hour interview mr jones thanked him at the end , informing the candidate that he would be hit for the appearance on what is considered a fringe show , despite its large audience among mr joness more suspect stances are his insistence that the shooting at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut was a hoax and that the government is creating chaos by manipulating weather systems he has been loudly and roundly denounced by democrats and some republicans he is also a vocal opponent of trade and immigration , two issues that dovetailed with mr trumps hard line positions during the primaries i think hes emerged as the single most powerful voice on the right , roger j stone jr , a longtime informal adviser to mr trump , said of mr jones it was mr stone who connected mr trump with mr jones months ago elitists may laugh at his politics , mr stone said , adding , alex jones is reaching millions of people , and they are the foot soldiers in the trump revolution mr jones said mr trump had promised to come on his radio show in the next few weeks and the radio host is positioning himself as someone who will hold mr trump accountable to the most anti establishment voices in his party mr jones said he planned to hold the incoming president to his campaign promises that includes appointing cabinet members who will pursue investigations of hillary clinton , he said if that does not happen , mr jones said , yes , people will be upset it will be an indication of a return to politics as normal , he added mr jones , who railed against the establishment news media throughout the interview , also warned mr trump to keep listening to the grass roots voters who helped elect him among the president elects interviews since his victory has been a traditional sit down with the cbs news program 60 minutes , one of the most establishment venues in journalism if he starts acting like hes divorced from us and doesnt care about us , theyll turn against him , mr jones said of mr trumps followers mr trump needs to complete only a portion of his promises , he said if he gets 20 percent done , people will be happy , he said

how did donald j trump win the presidency \? nearly every forecast model predicted that hillary clinton would be the next president of the united states we were in disbelief sort of during elections , most public opinion surveys try to identify likely voters and use them to predict the winner working with our students at cornell university , we took a different approach by focusing on respondents who said they did not intend to vote for mrs clinton or mr trump in our survey , this was a sizable group more than 20 percent of the public and our analysis indicated that they leaned toward mr trump whether undecided or unwilling to openly express their support , this group was hidden to pollsters focusing on likely voters we had found hidden trump supporters , but we did not expect them to swing the election after all , these respondents were unwilling to directly express their support for mr trump and were the most likely to indicate that if both candidates had flaws , it was better not to vote but vote they did this seems the most plausible explanation for why the near unanimous predictions of a clinton victory proved wrong who then were these hidden trump supporters \? to find out , we returned to our data \( a nationally representative sample of 1 , 461 adults surveyed in october \) to examine the opinions and policy preferences of four distinct groups those who indicated a trump vote , those who indicated a clinton vote , hidden trump supporters and hidden clinton supporters to identify hidden supporters , we relied on responses to whether they considered mr trump or mrs clinton more truthful for those who expressed the intention to vote for mr trump or mrs clinton , this question predicted vote choice with 97 5 percent accuracy this left us confident that the candidate the respondents deemed more truthful was the one whom they would vote for when we analyzed the opinions of hidden and committed supporters , a remarkable pattern emerged in all cases , hidden trump supporters were more moderate than those who indicated they would vote for mr trump not only were these hidden trump supporters less than half as likely as committed trump supporters to identify as political conservatives , but the proportion of respondents identifying as moderates was larger among hidden trump supporters than any other group the relatively moderate stance of hidden trump supporters also shows up in the survey questions posed by our students for example , when asked whether they trusted the police to do what was right for their community , hidden trump supporters said definitely at rates much closer to clinton supporters than to committed trump supporters \( a 6 percent difference versus a 20 percent difference \) similarly , when asked whether permanent residents who were not citizens should be allowed to vote , hidden trump supporters were more than twice as likely to agree than committed trump supporters and when asked whether it was acceptable for professional athletes to protest during the national anthem , hidden trump supporters were 2 5 times more likely to agree than were committed trump supporters , though still less likely to agree than clinton supporters to be sure , these hidden supporters make up only a small portion of trump voters , but they were the critical group that defied predictions and helped propel mr trump to victory many democrats are stunned that despite his campaigns divisiveness , false statements and disregard for civil discourse , mr trump will be in the white house in the coming days and weeks , there will continue to be much discussion regarding how the forecasts got public sentiment so wrong while it is tempting to assume that voters with extreme views made the difference , such voters have been vocally supporting mr trump all along rather than holding extreme views , hidden trump supporters consistently fell between committed trump and clinton voters on the ideological spectrum , our data suggests in the end , it appears that those hidden trump supporters were hiding in plain sight the tide turned on election night because americans with middle of the road positions who leaned toward trump turned out to vote in larger numbers than we or perhaps the clinton campaign anticipated this group , which helped swing the election , we hope , might also swing president trump in a more moderate direction
moscow president vladimir v putin of russia instructed his government on wednesday to withdraw from the treaty that created the international criminal court , while his government assailed the tribunal as ineffective and one sided the action was largely symbolic , because russia like the united states has not ratified the treaty and is not under the courts jurisdiction but it was another setback for the fairly young court , which handles cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity and is an emblem of the international order that is being shaken by populist revolts across the west essentially , this is just a gratuitous slap in the face , not a body blow , said kate cronin furman , a human rights lawyer and political scientist at the harvard kennedy school , who predicted that the election of donald j trump as president of the united states would lead to more harm for the court burundi , gambia and south africa moved recently to withdraw from the court , calling it biased because all the people it had convicted so far had been africans or because , in the case of south africa , it disagreed with the courts mandate to prosecute any individual , including a head of state zeid raad al hussein , the united nations high commissioner for human rights , tried on wednesday to rally support for the court a new trend of isolationist and unprincipled leadership is building up across the world , he said in an address to the general assembly of the courts member countries in the hague renewed attacks on the court may well be in the offing mr al hussein has sharply criticized the divisive and racist rhetoric of several european right wing politicians last month , he said that mr trump would without any doubt be a threat to global stability if the president elect stood by his campaign pledges to bar muslims from entering the united states , to deport millions of undocumented immigrants and to endorse the use of torture in a world that seems increasingly adrift , the turmoil yet to face humanity may be far greater than any challenge we have yet experienced , mr al hussein said on wednesday we face a choice we can safeguard our societies by standing firm on the principles of justice which anchor this institution or we can cast away the moorings of law laid down to save the world from horror in announcing russias withdrawal from the treaty , the russian foreign ministry said the court had failed to live up to expectations that it would serve as an impartial and authoritative arbiter of international law this week , the courts top prosecutor called russias annexation of crimea an ongoing state of occupation , a judgment affirmed by a united nations human rights committee , which reiterated the world bodys commitment to ukraines sovereignty over the black sea peninsula the ministry cited the courts approach toward russias brief war with georgia in 2008 the court has said it would investigate possible war crimes in georgia which is a member of the court by all parties , including russian armed forces an even sharper rebuke to the russian government came on monday , when the courts chief prosecutor , fatou bensouda , said in a report that the situation within the territory of crimea and sevastopol factually amounts to an ongoing state of occupation russia has insisted that its capture of crimea was warranted by the legitimate popular vote of the crimean people in a referendum the prosecutors report also said that the information available points to russias direct military involvement in the armed conflict in eastern ukraine , something that the russian authorities have denied repeatedly the russian federation deployed members of its armed forces to gain control over parts of the ukrainian territory without the consent of the ukrainian government , the report said russia might also be concerned about calls by western officials , including secretary of state john kerry , to have the court look into the bombing campaign in syria the court is the worlds first international tribunal with permanent jurisdiction to prosecute war crimes , genocide , crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression it was founded in 1998 , when 120 countries adopted the rome statute , and began operations in 2002 the court has headquarters in the hague mr putin directed russia to sign the rome statute in 2000 , but parliament did not ratify it the united states never ratified the rome statute , though the obama administration has cooperated with the courts proceedings ms bensouda , the chief prosecutor , said this week that she was considering an investigation into allegations of war crimes , torture and related treatment by american military forces and intelligence agencies in afghanistan , raising the prospect of a confrontation with the trump administration given that the i c c is a relatively young institution , and the norms surrounding it are not firmly entrenched , the loss of american leadership on accountability for mass atrocities could be profoundly damaging , said ms cronin furman , the human rights lawyer vladimir frolov , a scholar of international relations , called russias move a symbolic gesture prompted by ms bensoudas report on crimea at the time when russia signed the rome statute in 2000 , it wanted to be a part of the modern world , he said now it doesnt he added that he believed that many of russias actions in syria could potentially be subject to an investigation by this court
washington congressional democrats , divided and struggling for a path from the electoral wilderness , are constructing an agenda to align with many proposals of president elect donald j trump that put him at odds with his own party on infrastructure spending , child tax credits , paid maternity leave and dismantling trade agreements , democrats are looking for ways they can work with mr trump and force republican leaders to choose between their new president and their small government , free market principles senator chuck schumer of new york , elected wednesday as the new democratic minority leader , has spoken with mr trump several times , and democrats in coming weeks plan to announce populist economic and ethics initiatives they think mr trump might like democrats , who lost the white house and made only nominal gains in the house and senate , face a profound decision after last weeks stunning defeat make common cause where they can with mr trump to try to win back the white , working class voters he took from them , or resist at every turn , trying to rally their disparate coalition in hopes that discontent with an ineffectual new president will benefit them in 2018 mr trump campaigned on some issues that democrats have long championed and republicans resisted spending more on roads , bridges and rail , punishing american companies that move jobs overseas , ending a lucrative tax break for hedge fund and private equity titans , and making paid maternity leave mandatory some democrats are even co opting mr trumps language from the campaign every single person in our caucus agrees the system is rigged , said senator debbie stabenow , democrat of michigan still , there will be areas of bright line disagreement democrats are speaking out against mr trumps appointment of stephen k bannon as his chief strategist , and will oppose his promised tax cuts for the wealthy and his vow to deport millions of illegal immigrants what is not clear is whether mr trump will hew to his stated agenda or turn it over to republican lawmakers who seek a far more traditional conservative program in several key states , namely pennsylvania , ohio and wisconsin , democratic senate candidates and the partys presidential nominee , hillary clinton , failed to connect with middle class voters , who gravitated instead to the populist appeals of mr trump there is an acknowledgment that it is very shortsighted to blame this loss on a letter from the f b i or what states hillary went to , said senator amy klobuchar , democrat of minnesota we need to do a better job having a bold sharp focus on the economy , she said , like the cost of prescription drugs and predatory pricing on foreign steel it is not just being a collection of groups , she added its talking about policies in a serious way and talking about them in a way that touches all americans the competing political forces were evident in mr schumers selection of a leadership slate that reflects competing strains within the party , from senators bernie sanders of vermont and elizabeth warren of massachusetts , the best known figures in the progressive wing , to senator joe manchin iii of west virginia , one of a half dozen moderate democrats up for re election in 2018 this team is ideologically and geographically diverse , it mixes the wisdom of experience with the vigor of youth , at least in senate years , mr schumer said but mr schumers immediate challenge will be to meet the often competing imperatives of those senators , who reflect the democrats larger struggle of whether to try to tailor an appeal to the working class white voters who defected to mr trump or to try to increase the so called obama coalition anchored by minority and younger voters that debate is playing out in some ways in the house , where democrats have been knotted up in an internal battle over whether representative nancy pelosi of california , who hails from one of the wealthiest , most liberal districts in the nation , ought to make room at the top for a new leader , possibly from a rust belt state representative tim ryan of ohio , a former football player from the ailing industrial region around youngstown , is talking about challenging ms pelosi , and the contrast he would present would be stark democrats need someone like me , who has constituents and friends who are steelworkers or work in construction , mr ryan told the youngstown vindicator the economy and blue collar jobs are important for us as a party we need leaders who can go into these great lakes districts the struggle to stitch together a winning coalition will play out in the competing policy ideas that democrats are offering in a speech this week to the a f l c i o executive council , ms warren , who sparred in viciously personal terms with mr trump during the campaign , noted the many ways she agreed with the president elect he spoke of the need to reform our trade deals so they arent raw deals for the american people , she said he said he will not cut social security benefits he talked about the need to address the rising cost of college and about helping working parents struggling with the high cost of child care he spoke of the urgency of rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure and putting people back to work he spoke to the very real sense of millions of americans that their government and their economy has abandoned them and he promised to rebuild our economy for working people senator sherrod brown , democrat of ohio , long a critic of trade deals , said in an interview that he had spoken extensively with mr trumps trade adviser and would work with him on issues
washington the briefing materials are ready , loaded into tablet computers , secure internet sites or cloud computing applications officials from the white house and 100 federal agencies are on standby , waiting to meet landing teams from the president elects staff and brief them on how things really work in government the organizational charts have been meticulously mapped but eight days after president elect donald j trump won election in a stunning upset , surprising even himself , the process of transferring power from the obama administration to the trump administration has yet to grind into motion , delayed by a series of shake ups at trump tower that have sown confusion and discord one associate of mr trumps has told people that his operation is a month behind schedule under ideal circumstances , the process months in the planning by the obama administration and aides to both mr trump and his defeated opponent , hillary clinton looks far different parts of it are governed by a statute president obama signed this year to streamline the transition process and ensure an early start to a task that has been compared to a giant corporate merger involving a 4 trillion budget but for all the drama surrounding his transition to power , mr trump is hardly the first president elect to preside over a disorderly takeover the 1988 transition from ronald reagan to george bush was particularly nasty , because many reagan administration aides assumed wrongly , as it turned out that they would be in line to keep their jobs in a government that remained in republican hands bill clintons transition in 1992 was marred by a staff shake up that upended a carefully planned process mr clinton replaced his transition chief , mickey kantor , who had been mr clintons campaign chairman , with warren christopher , who would become secretary of state it was also hobbled by mr clintons campaign promise to slash white house staff by 25 percent , which made it more difficult to manage the government and even in the 2008 9 transition from george w bush to mr obama that members of both parties consider a model of efficiency , mr obama had to replace his head of personnel several times there is a long history of unfortunate transition activity , said max stier , the president and chief executive of the center for presidential transition , a project run by the nonpartisan partnership for public service still , he added , the trump transition is different in that it appears to lack guidance from seasoned government professionals who grasp the magnitude of the bureaucracy he is about to inherit you have a president elect who has been elected on a platform of change from the outside , mr stier said this is distinctive in that there is not anybody in the inner orbit who has deep understanding of the institution that trump is going to have to run a memorandum of understanding between the white house chief of staff and the leader of the president elects transition team is typically signed by both immediately after the election , as was the case when mr obama was preparing to take office the document governs the terms by which the presidents staff and that of the president elect collaborate , including important nondisclosure requirements for both sides , and its completion unlocks the rest of the transition process gov chris christie of new jersey signed such an agreement on nov 8 , before the election result was determined , but it was invalidated on friday when mr trump turned over the transition operation to vice president elect mike pence a transition spokesman said late tuesday that mr pence had signed the document but brandi hoffine , a white house spokeswoman , said the transition team had not yet provided the list of officials who would be participating in the process , a requirement before the handover can begin within a few days of the election , the landing teams are supposed to begin work at federal offices to learn about their inner workings , functions and responsibilities to determine how to staff crucial positions there and to figure out how they fit in with the new administrations goals and priorities they receive briefings about the pressing issues facing the agencies and immediate tasks that the president elect must undertake on day 1 this crucial time period in november is when the incoming presidents team typically devises plans for carrying out top policy priorities and develops a budget proposal that will be presented early the next year , defining the administrations goals and laying out a pathway for achieving them as of wednesday evening , nobody from mr trumps transition team had arrived at a federal agency to begin the review process , according to obama administration officials the transition team typically works quickly , based on plans put in place months before , to recruit , vet and hire the 4 , 000 presidential appointees needed to run the government , including about 1 , 000 who will require senate confirmation presidential candidates typically pre vet hundreds of potential appointees well before the election , cognizant of how quickly they must move once elected to build out their teams the obama administration , which found the process cumbersome and the governments mechanisms for managing it outdated in 2008 , has built a new software system for the president elect to track candidates for the appointments and process those selected according to the independent , nonpartisan center for presidential transition , a project of the partnership for public service , the president elect should aim to select 50 top cabinet appointees and key white house personnel before thanksgiving since the sept 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , national security preparedness has taken on outsized importance in transition planning in january 2009 , the week before mr obama was inaugurated , the bush administration held

athens having warned of the risks of a trump presidency , president obama returned on wednesday to a more optimistic vision of the future of the united states , as part of his final international tour while in office american democracy is bigger than any one person , mr obama told an audience in athens , before he departed for berlin that is why we have a tradition of the outgoing president welcoming the new one as i did last week but he also acknowledged that such transfers of power were not always easy , and he noted that the diversity of american society made governing a challenge as you may have noticed , the next american president and i could not be more different , mr obama said to a ripple of laughter mr obama took advantage of his trip to greece to make his first visit to the acropolis the ruins were a reminder that great powers , even democratic ones with remarkable cultures , can fall mr obama has largely spoken positively about the coming presidency of donald j trump , saying in a monday news conference that the president elect had reassured him that he would remain committed to nato and that he would keep portions of mr obamas health care law on tuesday , mr obama seemed to change tack , warning against what he said were dangerous divisions of race , religion and ethnicity we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an us and a them , he said on wednesday , he said that even if progress follows a winding path sometimes forward , sometimes back democracy is still the most effective form of government ever devised by man mr obama did acknowledge that democracy could be challenging and in multiethnic , multiracial , multicultural societies , like the united states , it can be especially complicated , he said believe me , i know but he said that globalization and automation , which have created the most prosperous and advanced society in history , were also creating extraordinary anxiety technology and automation mean that goods can be produced with fewer workers , the president said it means jobs and manufacturing can move across borders where wages are lower and rights are less protected those trends have also created a global elite that seems to live by a different set of rules , such as being able to avoid taxes , mr obama said that kind of inequality breeds resentment , he said , and is among the greatest challenges to modern democracies and to the economic formula that has yielded such benefits it fuels a feeling that globalization only benefits those at the top , the president said , adding and if people feel that they are losing control of their future , they will push back weve seen it here in greece and across europe we saw it in the vote in britain to leave the e u and now , weve seen it in the united states mr obama said that remaining a connected world is still crucial but that the current path of globalization demands a course correction to ensure that the fruits of those trends will be more broadly shared standing in the stavros niarchos foundation cultural center , which was bedecked with greek , american and european union flags , mr obama made a fervent pitch for the european union , which some greeks have advocated leaving in recent years because of the costs of remaining tied to the euro european integration the european union remains one of the great political and economic achievements of human history , mr obama said today , more than ever , the world needs a europe that is strong , prosperous and democratic and he praised greece for its efforts to shelter thousands of syrian refugees like the woman here in greece who said of the refugees arriving on these shores we live under the same sun we fall in love under the same moon we are all human we have to help these people , mr obama said to sustained applause women like that give me hope
washington president bashar al assad of syria , condemned by the obama administration and much of the west for waging a brutal war of suppression against islamist opponents in his country , said this week that president elect donald j trump could be a natural ally in the fight against terrorism the comment underscored the degree to which the new administrations approach could reverse central tenets of american foreign policy in an interview with the portuguese broadcaster rtp published on tuesday , mr assad whom president obama wants removed from office welcomed the prospect that mr trump would make good on his campaign promise to focus exclusively on fighting the islamic state and to align the united states with russia , a close ally of mr assads , in doing so the islamic state , also known as isis or isil , is one of an array of moderate and extremist groups seeking to topple mr assad the statements by mr assad a leader who secretary of state john kerry has said should be investigated for war crimes along with russia highlighted both the complexity of the foreign policy challenges awaiting mr trump and the extent to which he has signaled a break from mr obamas approach , especially in the middle east in syria , mr trump will inherit an especially tangled set of alliances and trade offs , a situation that has bedeviled mr obama in a region where the united states military is acting in support of efforts to contain or destroy the islamic state while allowing that what he called opposing forces within the administration could cast doubt on whether mr trump can deliver on his promises , mr assad said that if if he fights the terrorists , it is clear that we will be a natural ally , together with the russians , iranians and many other countries who want to defeat the terrorists his comments , while cautious , were the latest evidence of a growing expectation among both opponents and allies of the united states that mr trump will reverse mr obamas policy on mr assad , which lays much of the blame for the syrian civil war at his feet a european diplomat said wednesday that officials in germany and britain were bracing for an american about face on mr assad , and arab diplomats expressed a similar worry in an interview last week with the wall street journal , mr trump signaled as much , suggesting that once he took office he would drop american support for certain syrian opposition groups that have been fighting both the islamic state and the assad government , and focus solely on bombing the islamic state my attitude was youre fighting syria , syria is fighting isis , and you have to get rid of isis , mr trump said but foreign policy experts , both republican and democratic , say such a move will probably leave the new president with a very different problem deciding how to finesse the battleground of the syrian civil war which will still be going on without putting back in place all of the factors that led to the rise of the islamic state in the first place the islamic state is in retreat regardless of mr trump the american backed campaign to retake the last islamic state stronghold in iraq the city of mosul is well underway in syria , the american led coalition has been gaining ground on the islamic states stronghold of raqqa while raqqa may not be retaken by jan 20 when mr trump is sworn in , pentagon officials say that mosul probably will be and that raqqa could fall not long afterward but the battleground defeat of the islamic state is almost the easy part mr trumps administration will then have to confront hard choices on the other war in syria , namely balancing the competing forces of traditional american opponents syria , russia and iran with traditional american allies these include turkey , a nato ally , and the sunni arab countries , like saudi arabia and the united arab emirates , who want to arm and bolster groups opposed to the syrian government mr assad , russia and iran are fighting not only the islamic state , but also any syrian groups opposed to the government , including those backed by the united states and the sunni arab countries if mr trump abandons that alliance for the russia syria iran axis , he will effectively be strengthening mr assads government that is the same government whose repressive , anti sunni policies are blamed by american , european and arab governments for fueling the rise of the islamic state and other extremist groups to begin with you might win the battle against isis in raqqa , but you cant win the overall counterterrorism war , and achieve a favorable balance in the middle east , unless its linked to addressing the civil war with assad , said michael g vickers , a former top pentagon official aligning with russia , and implicitly with assad and the iranians , would be a strategic blunder with our sunni allies some syrian rebel groups , long frustrated that the obama administration has not given them greater military support , say they are bracing for a complete cessation of american aid , but they express hope that allies like saudi arabia and turkey will continue to supply them , even in defiance of the trump administration emile hokayem , a scholar at the international institute for strategic studies , said mr assad had long calculated that , over time , western countries would either adopt his view that the rebels were all radicalized jihadists , or prioritize fighting terrorist groups over support for the moderate forces challenging mr assads rule this was a waiting game par excellence , one perfected by his father and now him , and one that seems to be paying off

this article is part of the opinion today newsletter you can sign up here to receive more briefings and a guide to the section daily in your inbox many of the things that keep our democracy healthy dont appear in the constitution or any federal law president obama made this point monday when talking about an orderly transition from one presidency to the next its not something that the constitution explicitly requires but it is one of those norms that are vital to a functioning democracy , similar to norms of civility and tolerance and a commitment to reason and facts and analysis the last few words of that sentence were the ones that caught my attention , and i started thinking about them again after reading an op ed by zeynep tufekci tufekci , a university of north carolina professor , makes the case that facebook is in denial about its role in spreading misinformation during the presidential campaign , facebook helped spread falsehoods the pope endorsed trump ! to millions of people those falsehoods appeared in fake news articles , and facebook did nothing to inform their users that the material in them was simply made up mark zuckerberg , facebooks chief executive , has said its pretty crazy to believe that fake news influences people in any significant way , but tufekci persuasively lays out evidence to the contrary multiple studies have shown and common sense backs up that facebook influences opinions and behavior these are not easy problems to solve , but there is a lot facebook could do , tufekci wrote when the company decided it wanted to reduce spam , it established a policy that limited its spread the step that facebook announced monday refusing to display advertisements in fake stories isnt sufficient the media is in the midst of a historical transition right now some old news sources are shrinking or disappearing , and others many of which rely on facebook are rising there is nothing wrong with this change our country has survived the fading of news powerhouses , like the saturday evening post , life magazine and live radio broadcasts , before but whatever forms the new information sources take , they do need to provide reason and facts , neither of which is partisan a healthy democracy depends on it as thomas jefferson said , the people need full information of their affairs zuckerberg , by believing that facebook is staying neutral , has in fact made a damaging choice
istanbul the election of donald j trump as the next president of the united states came as an unpleasant shock to much of the world but in turkey , my country , it was applauded not by everyone , for sure , but by president recep tayyip erdogan and his enthusiastic supporters as it became clear that the republican candidate had achieved an upset , pro government turkish columnists , some of whom are also members of parliament , began cheering it as a blow to the american establishment mr trump won , they emphasized , despite the opposition of the american news media , wall street , the c i a and hollywood hillary clintons defeat , they declared , was the defeat of the globalist fascists the first official statement from the government came from bekir bozdag , the justice minister and an erdogan confidant nobody can win elections with newspaper headlines , polls , televisions , mr bozdag said the american people said no to their will being manipulated then came the response from mr erdogan himself he congratulated the american president elect in a phone conversation that went unbelievably well , the news media here reported he also invited mr trump to visit turkey as soon as possible then mr erdogan criticized the protests in the united states over the election as the work of the same global cabal that he says is constantly trying to topple him there are pragmatic reasons for this turkish love affair with mr trump , which was evident in the pro government media months before the election the primary reason is a strong distaste for mrs clinton the democratic candidate was accused of having ties to the islamic group led by fethullah gulen , a turkish imam living in the united states who is widely believed to have orchestrated a coup attempt against mr erdogan in july moreover , mrs clintons vow to continue american support for kurdish fighters in syria , whom turkey considers a terrorist threat , angered the turkish government in contrast , mr trump has not seriously suggested that he would support any policies that would upset the turkish government he did give great credit to mr erdogan right after the coup attempt for being able to turn that around a message that was well received in ankara but mr trump and mr erdogan also seem to have a more fundamental connection supporters of the turkish president see the american president elect as a similar figure an outsider who horrifies the elite yet is able to win at the ballot box theres something to this , but theres also a major problem in claiming any ideological similarities between the two men mr erdogans supporters claim a strong devotion to islam and solidarity with fellow muslims \( indeed , to show that this islamic solidarity extends all the way to america , mr erdogan flew to kentucky in june to attend the funeral of muhammad ali \) mr trump , to say the least , has no solidarity with islam during his campaign , he called for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states he suggested that he would register muslim americans in a special database his candidacy attracted support from islamophobes both in the united states and in europe why are mr erdogans supporters able to overlook these stances \? it seems that despite their conflicting values , turkish and american populists can find common cause in their hatred of the liberal elite , and in their claim to represent the people there is some hypocrisy , or at best self delusion , in this populist narrative populists demonize the establishment only to seize it for themselves this is evident in turkey , where mr erdogans supporters still pose as oppressed underdogs , even though they now control the news media , business and the government at all levels populists also have a lot of anger about the worlds problems , but no magic solutions their ascension to power in many corners of the globe is seen by liberal pessimists as the beginning of a new dark age but if we are lucky , it can also be an age of trial and error , at the end of which a more mature liberalism may arise societies learn more from their bitter experiences , after all , than from the ruminations of their intellectuals with regard to mr trump , there is another silver lining he seems to be a businessman , not a politician with strong ideological and religious convictions there is a turkish saying a crown makes a head wiser perhaps americas new president can prove pragmatic enough to back off from the scary ideas he put forward during his campaign , and to follow a more moderate line , as he signaled in his victory speech the trump presidency may also help ease the tensions in turkish american relations mr erdogan and his government have been rightfully requesting that mr gulen , the imam , be extradited to face trial in turkey if mr trumps administration agrees to do this and gen michael t flynn , a trump adviser on security matters , has suggested that he supports mr gulens extradition its easy to imagine a honeymoon between washington and ankara this will probably mean less interference in turkeys internal affairs , as ankara hopes , which means less american criticism of our sinking democratic credentials paradoxically , that may help keep turkey in the western alliance at a time when darker forces , such as russia , are eager to seduce it however , mr trump will probably conduct less interference in syria and egypt as well , giving blank checks to brutal crackdowns on islamists in those dictatorships then mr erdogans supporters will have to rethink their position do they really want a world in which the winners , like themselves , freely trample whomever they want
kiev , ukraine few politicians in the world have had to undergo the same experience twice in their career and in different countries yet this is exactly what happened to me in ukraine and georgia i was the president of georgia for nine years , during which it went from a kleptocracy and failed state to a country that won international recognition for tackling corruption and became one of the easiest places in europe to conduct business named the worlds top reformer by the world bank in 2006 , georgia became a flagship among the countries of the former soviet bloc after my second presidential term in 2013 , i left to pursue academic work in the united states for a time , and then returned to ukraine where , as a young man , i had spent several years at kiev university responding to calls from my ukrainian friends to help apply my experience in government , i arrived along with the wave of enthusiasm for reform that followed the maidan revolution i offered to work in odessa , the largest region of ukraine it was highly unusual for a former president of another state to serve as a governor in a different country , but the very fate of ukrainian statehood was at stake in odessa the province was not only riddled with local mafia groups infamous for their thuggishness , but it was also threatened by the conflict with russian backed separatists in the east odessa borders the breakaway region of transnistria in moldova , which is controlled by moscow backed separatists and russian armed forces i brought with me a group of professionals from my previous government , who started to overhaul ukraines police force and helped to lead the countrys first anti corruption agency the reform of the police force was an immediate popular success , while the new anti graft agency established several high profile investigations we seemed to have the encouragement of ukraines president to push ahead the city of odessa was recovering from the clashes of may 2 , 2014 , with pro russian militants , in which scores of people were killed focusing on reconstruction and reform , i opened a competitive process to recruit the most talented western educated professionals to fill the leadership positions in district administrations i created an economic development board to help local businessmen circumvent crooked officials in state agencies , and i invited yulia marushevska , a prominent young maidan activist , to clean up odessas customs service , which was notorious for bribery and kickbacks we began a program of repairing roads and other infrastructure we worked hard to raise standards in public services to new levels and restore security to the region as the reform movement picked up pace and gained popularity , we suddenly ran into resistance where we least expected it from people in prominent positions in government back in the capital , kiev the first sign of trouble was when i had to confront the then prime minister , arseniy p yatsenyuk , over evidence of corruption involving government officials at a chemical plant in odessa , one of the largest state owned enterprises of its kind starting in january , i toured the country to publicize our anti corruption cleaning up ukraine movement in order to put pressure on the countrys leaders to put a stop to this graft by ukraines ultrarich in march , ukraines parliament voted to remove the prosecutor general , and the following month , the prime minister resigned ukraines president , petro o poroshenko , pledged to crack down on the old practices and bring in greater transparency that was more than seven months ago , yet we have not seen any major changes there was no big clear out of the cronies i was left , instead , with the impression that local leaders of the presidents party were working to undermine the anti corruption efforts my administration was starved of funding for months , the appointment of several of my key deputies has been stalled , and some of our most able reformers have quit in frustration ms marushevska , the customs agency head whom i appointed , said she was harassed with trumped up official reprimands similar tactics were used by the prosecutor generals office , which raided the office of one of my advisers despite these aggressive searches , no charges have been filed the final straw for me came when the online disclosures of ukrainian officials personal wealth , the so called e declarations , were published last month here were the very public servants with whom i had to work on a daily basis shamelessly declaring the millions of dollars they had stashed under their mattresses it was the decades long rule of this post soviet kleptocratic elite that turned this potentially wealthy nation into one of the poorest countries in europe ukraine need not be poor , but corrupt officials have systematically pillaged the country , robbing ukrainians of the prosperity that should be theirs while ukraines soldiers are on the front line , heroically defending their country from russian aggression , ukraines elite keeps stripping the country of all it has left in their lifestyle and mentality , ukraines kleptocrats are identical to their counterparts in russias oligarchy the final freedom for ukraine would be to free it not just from russian aggression but also from the russian style political class that holds ukraine back from its european aspirations back in 2001 , after failing to persuade georgias president , eduard shevardnadze , to force through meaningful reforms and get rid of his corrupt entourage , i resigned from the government i went on to found georgias united national movement , which led to the 2003 rose revolution , which finally brought real reform to georgia the success of georgias revolution served as an inspiration to many of the maidan activists of 2014 in ukraine just
after brexit and the election of donald trump , it seems alarming that bulgaria and moldova , two states formerly under the kremlins yoke , both elected pro russian presidents on sunday the reasons may have been largely domestic , but the outcome is bound to further fray european cohesion the presidencies in these countries are largely ceremonial bulgaria , unlike moldova , is a member of both the european union and nato and is not likely to quit either the elections in both countries were heavily influenced by public frustration with corruption and with living standards that continue to lag behind western neighbors more than two decades after the collapse of communist rule but the swing away from pro western candidates toward those urging better relations with moscow offers more evidence of growing disenchantment in eastern europe with western liberal attitudes , exacerbated by the tide of immigrants bulgaria and moldova were the latest to be affected by nationalist and anti globalization sentiments that have spread across europe and that helped elect mr trump in the united states president vladimir putin of russia is bound to take comfort in these developments , which give him hope that western sanctions over russias annexation of crimea will soon be lifted the votes in bulgaria and moldova , however , were less an endorsement of mr putins rule than a reflection of economic and geographic ties bulgarians have traditionally had close personal and economic ties with the russians , and the sanctions against russia have hurt bulgarias economy , the poorest in the e u the socialist backed president elect , rumen radev a political novice and former nato fighter pilot who spent a year training in america pledged to seek improved relations with russia , arguing that being pro european did not mean being anti russian probably a stronger factor in mr radevs election was popular anger at the pace of reform under the center right government of prime minister boiko borisov , who promptly resigned in moldova , a former soviet republic , the winning candidate , igor dodon , called for a repeal of an association agreement signed with the european union in 2014 , which provoked a painful russian embargo on moldovan wine and fruit exports in moldova , too , the election was colored by anger over corruption , and especially a bank fraud in 2014 in which 1 billion disappeared whether the presidents can do much to assuage the frustrations of their people is uncertain , especially given the limits on their powers and there is no evidence that voters in bulgaria or moldova want to return to russian domination but the brexit vote and the trump victory show how popular discontent with disparate issues can lead to unexpected and fateful consequences whatever the individual voters in bulgaria and moldova had in mind , their receptivity to warmer relations with mr putin is another blow to western cohesion at a critical juncture that makes it all the more important for western leaders who understand the importance of unity to resist all attempts to turn back the clock
dear president elect trump well , you won you were not my choice , but youre soon going to be my president i have no intention of forgetting or forgiving the abhorrent things you said and did during the campaign they hurt real people , debased our political process and erased social norms vital for keeping our diverse society together i am not done resisting all that just because you won however , im not going to spend every day hoping you fail too much is at stake since youre clearly rethinking some of your extreme campaign promises , the right response for me is principled engagement so lets start now please revisit your claim that climate change is a hoax nothing would get the attention of your opponents more than if you declared your intent to take a fresh look at the climate issue it would force many of them to give you a second look and virtually none of your supporters would care , because few voted for you on this issue and they all know that their kids understand the climate is changing and would be heartened if you did , too speaking of kids , mr trump , yours run your golf course business surely theyve mentioned that doral will be your first course threatened by global warming , because parts of miami are already flooding due to sea level rise from melting ice according to the real deal , which covers south florida real estate news , parts of miami beach could be inundated with floodwaters in as little as 15 years that would make your oceanside courses into ocean floor courses this is no hoax the u s just experienced its third warmest october on record , and , as the washington post noted on thursday , north americas most astonishing warmth this week has focused in canada , where temperatures have been up to 30 degrees warmer than normal thats unprecedented when you visit the pentagon , ask the generals about climate change heres what theyll tell you a majority of immigrants flooding europe today are not coming from syria or iraq three quarters are from arid zones in central africa , where the combination of climate change and runaway population growth are making small scale farming unsustainable last april , as part of a national geographic channel documentary , i followed a group of these refugees from senegal through niger on their way to libya and europe thousands make this trek every month the same thing will happen in our hemisphere and no wall will keep them back you cant ignore climate change and think you have an immigration policy at the same time , please understand , if you appoint a climate change denier to head the environmental protection agency and walk america away from the paris accord , which committed 190 countries to reduce their emissions of the carbon dioxide pollutants that warm the planet , you will trigger a ferocious reaction by young people in america and across europe the backlash in europe will totally undermine your ability to lead the western alliance and as the climate physicist joe romm put it to me , do you really want to risk going down in history as the man who killed the worlds last , best chance to avoid catastrophic warming \? there is a better way for you you can frame the entire shift in your position in terms of free market economics hal harvey , who advises major companies on climate and energy policy , notes that thanks to technological advances , the cost of solar energy has dropped more than 80 percent since 2008 , wind costs dropped more than 50 percent since 2008 , battery costs dropped more than 70 percent since 2008 , and led lighting costs dropped more than 90 percent since 2008 as a result , a clean future now costs less than a dirty one today , from california to mexico to the middle east , solar and wind prices are as low as 3 cents a kilowatt hour added harvey that compares to about 6 cents for a new natural gas power plant , and double that for new coal and remember commodity costs coal , oil , gas fluctuate , but technology costs wind , solar , leds follow irreversible trends downward , and so when a new technology crosses the cost line with an old commodity , its goodbye to the old commodity for good have you seen the pictures from new delhi and beijing lately \? people there cant breathe , owing to the pollution from burning crops and fossil fuels so what are the indians doing \? theyre curbing the burning of crops , the use of diesel cars , and they just shut down the coal based badarpur power plant they have to find alternatives to fossil fuels so theyre investing heavily in clean tech is your strategy to keep america addicted to coal and scuttle our lead in clean tech which is destined to become the next great global export industry and is already spawning good blue collar jobs so we can import clean energy systems from india and china \? mr trump , you won florida , but do you know who lost there besides hillary \? old line utilities they spent over 20 million pushing a referendum intended to curb the growth of solar energy in the state so floridians said yes to trump , yes to solar energy and no to those who wanted to stop both there is a message for you in that bottle
even before he won the presidency , donald j trump had a strong claim to being the most ideologically disruptive presidential nominee of modern times from the bush family to paul ryan , the iraq war to entitlement reform , trump arrayed himself against the personalities and policies of the republican party , and his campaign took a wrecking ball to many of his adopted partys orthodoxies , proposing a vision of right wing politics far more mercantilist , nationalist and statist than anything weve seen from the post reagan , post goldwater g o p his primary campaign proved that this vision is popular with republican voters , and his shocking general election win suggests that trumpism might be more politically potent than the conservatism it overthrew but his revolution was so sudden and sweeping that it raced ahead of itself , capturing the white house without having any of the plans and personnel and foot soldiers that actually operationalizing trumpism would require every administration tends to have ideological divisions , to rely on an old guard of party people \( moderate republicans in the reagan era , clintonites in the obama presidency \) alongside its newcomers , innovators and ideological insurgents but in this case , apart from the infamous but still marginal alt right and the small clutch of conservative intellectuals for trump \( most of whom dont agree on what being for trump means \) , there is really no trumpist new guard at all , at least among the people qualified to staff a presidential administration no roster of elected officials who rose to power promising to make america great again , no list of policy thinkers who have spent the last decade dreaming of tariffs and mapping out keynesian infrastructure projects and planning for a dtente with moscow instead , trump campaigned surrounded by politicians , operatives and surrogates whose only real commonality was opportunism back when he seemed likely to lose the election handily , this was a reason to wonder about his movements staying power would newt gingrich , ben carson and sean hannity really remain european style populist nationalists once their patron was defeated \? but now that hes won , it raises a different question can trumpism survive a trump administration \? consider , for instance , foreign policy , where trump campaigned as a critic of the iraq war and neoconservatism , as a man ready to make a deal with russia in order to crush the islamic state and less inclined to unleash wars of choice than his liberal interventionist opponent this is not a combination of views widely shared among potential republican secretaries of state and defense but were the president elect a shrewd judge of ideology , it might be possible to come up with a foreign policy team a mix of realist internationalists and war weary jacksonians , jon huntsmans and jim webbs that matched reasonably well with his overarching vision but instead trump is apparently considering rudy giuliani and john bolton for the state department the former because of his campaign trail loyalty , the latter \( presumably \) because of his connections to the heritage foundation , which volunteered itself for the transition process back when that process seemed unlikely to go anywhere both men do share a temperament with trump combative , adversarial , sometimes bullying but neither is particularly trumpist when it comes to the actual details of foreign policy indeed , both are embodiments of the full spectrum hawkishness that the businessman candidate often campaigned against \( bolton , for instance , took to the pages of this newspaper last fall to dismiss trumps idea of an american russian coalition against isis as both undesirable and glib \) now it could be that in a trump cabinet they would gradually conform their worldviews to his , as presidential appointees often do , and that trumpism would advance \( as it did on the campaign trail \) through convenient conversions among the people charged with putting it into effect but since trump himself is inexperienced , underinformed and deeply malleable , its also quite possible that if he appoints conventional full spectrum hawks to key posts , full spectrum hawkishness is what well get that by year two of a trump administration well be arming the ukrainians and syrian rebels , saber rattling anew with the russians , and adding another intervention or two to the obama administrations \( six and counting \) frozen conflicts indeed , this is explicitly what a lot of people in the republican party are hoping for , in foreign policy and in many other arenas besides to the extent that personnel is policy , they believe that once were well into the trump era , his populist nationalist synthesis will look like a campaign trail prop rather than a new kind of right wing revolution this is certainly a reasonable bet at the same time , trump has made reasonable bettors look like fools for nearly 18 months and with the official elevation of steve bannon , the dark prince of breitbart , its clear that there will be people who believe fully in the populist nationalist revolution in his white house , even if their alt right ties prevent them from holding any kind of cabinet post perhaps this means there will be a persistent division between rhetoric and policy , in which trump continues to publicly sell himself as a new sort of nationalist and his populist allies try to go mainstream and win converts and become the ideological cadres that trumpism now lacks even as the gears of government grind in the grooves that mike pence and ryan and the conservative movement prefer but more likely it means that we should expect more of what we saw throughout trumps presidential campaign that between a populism unready for power and an establishment with the technical qualifications to govern but no mandate for doing
if election day seemed to be a dream \( or , rather , nightmare \) devoid of logic , the week since has done little to render the world more coherent lets review donald trump , exulting in his big win , addressed the question of the wall you know , the central pledge of his candidacy , reiterated at every rally a mighty barrier between the united states and mexico that only he was potent enough to erect and what did he have to say \? that it might be a mere fence in spots a fence ! just three days after his victory , he was downscaling , backtracking at this rate , hell be talking at his inauguration about a glorious hedge along the border by april itll be flowering shrubs , with blossoms that spell out welcome to america and by june \? some sort of new christo installation , maybe the worlds largest ever topiary display as for obamacare , its apparently not so awful after all trump said he liked the part that lets kids stay on their parents insurance plans , which is , if you think about it , sort of what donald jr , ivanka and eric have been doing all along he also liked the part that prevents insurers from disqualifying people for pre existing conditions my hunch \? if some crafty democrat drafts legislation to keep the affordable care act as is but rechristen it trumpcare , hell sign the bill in a nanosecond hes a man in thrall to ego , not policy president obama is betting on that hes suddenly professing faith in trump or , rather , playing a fascinating mind game in which he endeavors to save his legacy by complimenting trump into compliance that was some through the looking glass news conference on monday , when obama , who had previously warned that trump was all four horsemen of the apocalypse rolled into one shocking jockey , spoke of trumps gifts and how gregarious he could be i dont think he is ideological , obama said ultimately , he is pragmatic from your lips , mr president , to gods ear he said that their initial meeting had gone so well that he could , on this last foreign trip of his presidency , allay our allies anxieties never mind that trump and vladimir putin were already whispering sweet nothings to each other over the phone \( youre the man no , youre the man \) or that steve bannon was en route to the west wing perhaps the bannon appointment didnt sink in fully until tuesday , when obama , in greece , had chillier words of warning about the direction in which a trump administration might but mustnt turn we are going to have to guard against a rise in a crude sort of nationalism , he said thats hardly the extent of the vigil trump is reportedly seeking security clearances for his children , who will be running his business , and a former state department official watching an increasingly messy transition process took to twitter to warn other republicans to stay away from trumps angry , arrogant team obama is partly trying to save face after hillary clintons devastating loss in the weeks before the election , he implored americans honor me by choosing her not enough of them did , and at mondays news conference , he seemed to steal a page from trumps playbook and take issue with her stamina he never said her name but noted , pointedly , how he had trudged through every small town and fair and fish fry in iowa , a state that he won in 2008 and 2012 and that she , with less trudging , lost he also repeatedly recited a litany of yardsticks by which he was leaving the country in fantastic fettle was he reassuring us or himself \? from his electrifying address at the 2004 democratic convention through his stirring 2008 presidential campaign , he spoke of transcending blue and red , uniting black and white , healing and here we are it has to gall him it definitely gives him incentive to use whatever psychological jujitsu necessary to nudge and manipulate trump he doesnt want historians to write that he opened the door to a monster so hes pressing for a sunnier tale the monster defanged , the nation safe and sound and hes a patriot , always has been , which is whats so rich here trump bangs on about putting america first , when he really puts himself before all else that shriveled , unhinged hood ornament of his , rudy giuliani , is on the record questioning obamas love for america but obama loves this country enough to summon the same grace for his successor that other presidents did for theirs , though his is a nasty , juvenile breed apart and he loves this country enough to try to calm it when it most needs calming , even if that means a willed optimism about trump thats oh so difficult to share
if you bought yourself or someone you love medicine , a smartphone , new clothes or a childs toy today , your purchase was most likely made from a mix of components from many countries the same was true for the meal you bought , the car you drove , the plane on which you recently flew and the carpet where your feet rest as you read these words our everyday life is made possible by trade critics of trade agreements , led by president elect donald j trump , want to change direction , renegotiating pacts like nafta which mr trump called the worst trade deal in history and the agreement that brought china into the world trade organization he wants to tear up the pending trans pacific partnership among the united states , japan and 10 other asia pacific countries mr trump , as well as many liberal critics of trade pacts , claims that the best way to raise incomes for americans and strengthen the power of citizens over corporations is to restrict international collaboration and reassert our national autonomy this is an illusion the only way to advance the interests of american workers and consumers is to negotiate better and stronger international arrangements the tpp represents an important step forward , and whether or not that deal survives in some form or other , trade agreements still remain among the best ways to give governments greater power to protect their citizens and improve the living standards of workers we live in a world where fewer of the things we use come from any one place more than half the goods and nearly three quarters of the services traded globally are components from different countries known as intermediates that are later combined for final use multinational corporations are responsible for a majority of world trade and , by definition , transcend national boundaries nations compete vigorously for the investments of these companies , often by cutting corporate taxes and shelling out subsidies one result is that no government on its own even a powerful one like the united states can advance the interests of its citizens without the cooperation of other governments consider the safety of the food we eat and the drugs we take opponents argue that trade agreements weaken the ability of the united states to set and enforce its own high standards but the united states food and drug administration demonstrates the futility of a fortress america approach f d a regulated imports over the past 12 years have grown nearly sixfold , from six million to 35 million shipments involving more than 300 , 000 facilities in more than 150 different countries it is simply impossible for the f d a to enforce its high health and safety standards without local regulators and industry in other countries doing the same competition for investment is another example trade opponents hope that killing trade deals will stop corporations from outsourcing investments and bring jobs back to the united states mr trump favors corporate tax reform to lure companies home but cutting corporate taxes wont work if other countries keep using beggar thy neighbor tax schemes to attract investment the near zero tax rate that ireland offered to lure apple is just the most egregious example international cooperation is the only way to reduce such destructive competition , which dries up the revenues available for governments to spend on other priorities like infrastructure , a top trump promise mr trump believes the united states can reduce its dependency on other governments by imposing high trade barriers and ensuring that the goods that americans consume are made at home but that would require reconfiguring the auto , computer , pharmaceutical and many other industries that employ millions of americans and are now deeply integrated in global supply chains there would also be a staggering cost to american consumers , and other nations like china have warned they would retaliate in kind against american exports trade agreements are not the only way for nations to collaborate , but they provide the economic incentives and high level political commitment to help move cooperation forward and make it stick trade agreements can enable governments to reach consensus on investment rules , promote regulatory cooperation and transparency , and set more developing countries on the path of raising workplace and environmental standards the opposition to the current generation of trade deals is wrongheaded because these deals do more than any other arrangements to date to address these issues the tpp includes fairly strong provisions to help national regulators do their jobs better and for the first time , it has rules aimed at ensuring that state owned enterprises do not enjoy special government subsidies american trade negotiations with the european union offer a chance to crack down on wasteful tax incentives and strengthen government leverage over corporations mr trump ran on a trade policy of economic nationalism and won that mandate should be respected , but america first cannot be advanced by america alone total national sovereignty over global commerce is a mirage the goal of economic nationalists like mr trump should be to bolster the ability of the government to act effectively and in the best interests of its citizens in expanding and managing global commerce to do this , we need more , not less , cooperation in international trade
northampton , mass one week after the election , many students on my campus , one of the nations largest womens colleges , remain heartbroken that hillary clinton was not able to shatter , in her words , the highest , hardest glass ceiling at smith , every student leadership position from captain of the sports team to president of the student government is held by a woman , but my students know , even today , that this is a rare exception in a sexist world still , there was a lot of hope and excitement on campus leading up to election day this week , one student told me im still in shock the reality is hitting me in waves many people have attributed mrs clintons loss to her actions in public life , or to an america that wanted change at any cost but this loss is as much about sexism as anything else for our mothers , sexism was explicit their war stories would make any title ix officer today shudder for our daughters , todays students , sexism is often implicit both men and women internalize stubborn cultural biases about gender that affect our understandings , actions and decisions for this reason , female leaders are restricted by far more than ceilings glass walls erected by these unconscious biases box women into traditional roles and limit our opportunities the psychologist raymond cattell coined a phrase coercion to the biosocial mean that addresses this issue society punishes people who deviate from culturally expected patterns or push boundaries every professional woman i know could share incident after incident that illustrates this phenomenon once , for example , a colleague told me that he thought i was scary when i voiced a strong opinion about a job candidate during a faculty meeting i went home feeling chastised the next day i checked with a few female colleagues they had found me convincing , not scary this kind of feedback leads to an irresolvable conflict for female leaders if women stay boxed in by the norms of our gender passive , gentle and congenial we may not be viewed as leadership material if women adopt the norms of a leader commanding , decisive and assertive we may be punished for being too bossy , too pushy , too strident , too ambitious , too scary the glass walls of coercion were on full display during the presidential election donald j trump repeatedly accused mrs clinton of lacking stamina code for women are weak but he also referred to her as a nasty woman , implying she was moving out of the bounds of proper behavior for her gender he may as well have said , women need to know their place on top of that , reince priebus , the current head of the republican party and future chief of staff for mr trump , tweeted that mrs clinton needed to smile more , a coded reminder that women must project beauty and deference to the male gaze its hard to believe it has been more than 50 years since the second wave of feminism as gloria steinem has noted , first a movement is ridiculed , and then it isnt news anymore that may explain the stunning lack of coverage about mrs clintons constant female balancing act throughout the campaign there is ample social science that shows how society expects more from female leaders than from male leaders in one yale school of management study , participants who evaluated fictional stories of leaders making mistakes , rated women three times more negatively than men for those mistakes a huge effect in the real world , female chief executives are more likely to become targets of campaigns by activist investors , and women at the top of all professions are regularly subjected to intensive scrutiny and now , in the age of the internet , abusive online comments especially when they venture into traditionally male realms like sports and technology this is obviously not the world i want for my students its time to take a sledgehammer to the glass walls the best way to stop coercion is to make the invisible visible by sharing our stories when we can better name whats happening , we can begin to change the narrative to this aim , i invited smith students to my home on sunday night , with no agenda except to listen sixty students showed up they reported feeling vulnerable and fearful about the future , for themselves and the country they were most galvanized by the need to address the intersection of sexism with racism , islamophobia , classism and other forms of hatred notably , students of color spoke about expecting more from white feminists in our role as allies they are right to expect more , and i , for one , plan to do more student after student representing both parties described the election as a wake up call they have already begun to organize and this is a generation that knows how to do so , as the occupy wall street and black lives matter movements powerfully demonstrated by the end of the night , students were discussing how to pressure their members of congress and how to prepare for the midterm elections increased activism by students and others may be the silver lining of this election students also spoke powerfully about the value of sharing experiences as the evening went on , i could hear them rewriting the narrative with every story it reminded me of a story i didnt get a chance to share with them the last time someone called me bossy , a term reserved for women alone , i simply replied , at smith , we call it leadership
completely normal it happened in the reagan transition clinton had delays in hiring people rudolph w giuliani , the former new york mayor and a leading contender to be president elect donald j trumps secretary of state , on the uncertain start to the white house transition
before this month , new balance was lucky if it generated a few hundred reactions to posts on its facebook page now , the sneaker companys page is flooded with impassioned commentary , and it has found itself compelled to make a statement distancing itself from white supremacists it started , when matt lebretton , the companys vice president for communications , told the wall street journal last week that we feel things are going to move in the right direction under donald j trump mr lebrettons comments were made in the context of mr trumps opposition to the trans pacific partnership , a trade deal that new balance says will hurt its production of shoes in the united states while rewarding competitors that make more of their products overseas some consumers , however , saw that comment as a full throated endorsement of mr trump and reacted immediately , circulating images that showed new balance shoes being burned or thrown in the trash that led the brand to clarify its position through a statement in which it noted that it publicly supported the trade positions of hillary clinton , bernie sanders and donald trump prior to election day that focused on american manufacturing job creation it also posted a statement to facebook saying , from the people who make our shoes to the people who wear them , we believe in acting with the utmost integrity and we welcome all walks of life but that was only the start over the weekend , the daily stormer , a website rife with anti semitic , anti gay hate speech and white supremacist language , derided the complaints and championed new balance as the official shoes of white people , encouraging readers to buy them \( in a blog post last year , the southern poverty law center , described the daily stormer as the newest up and comer in the heated competition to rule the hate web \) the ensuing support from white supremacists and other members of what is known as the alt right , led new balance to distance itself from such commentary and address the nature of its remark about mr trump new balance , based in boston , wrote on its twitter and facebook pages on monday night that it does not tolerate bigotry or hate in any form and that a recent comment about trade policy was taken out of context it added , as a 110 year old company with five factories in the u s and thousands of employees worldwide from all races , genders , cultures and sexual orientations , new balance is a values driven organization and culture that believes in humanity , integrity , community and mutual respect for people around the world on facebook , the post has attracted more than 5 , 000 reactions and hundreds of comments , some lauding the company and others from supporters and detractors of mr trump criticizing its response the company did not immediately respond to requests for comment on tuesday the daily stormer responded with a claim that new balances denouncement was a hoax , in a post on tuesday that turned into an anti semitic rant
two nights after donald j trump won the presidential election , archbishop jos h gomez convened an interfaith prayer service at the roman catholic cathedral in los angeles and gave an emotional homily vowing not to abandon children and parents who are living in fear that mr trump will follow through on his promise to deport millions of immigrants this should not be happening in america , said archbishop gomez , who is himself an immigrant from mexico and a naturalized united states citizen we are not this kind of people we are better than this five days later , on tuesday , archbishop gomez was elected by his brother bishops at their meeting in baltimore to be vice president of the united states conference of catholic bishops with nine candidates in the running including some prominent prelates it was the days most closely watched vote , especially since the vice president is traditionally elevated to president in three years keeping to custom , the bishops voted to bump up cardinal daniel n dinardo , archbishop of galveston houston , to president the choice of archbishop gomez was only one sign that catholic bishops are preparing to defend immigrants and refugees against a newly elected president who has threatened deportations and who critics say has uncorked an ugly backlash against immigrants and minorities they opened their meeting by endorsing a strongly worded letter to mr trump that extended congratulations but also put him on notice that the church was committed to resettling refugees and keeping immigrant families intact a lot of bishops told me they were surprised by the actual fear they were hearing on the ground , said dylan corbett , the executive director of the hope border institute , an advocacy group on united states mexico border issues he formerly worked for the bishops conference and attended the meeting in baltimore in the past week , latino parishioners and students at catholic colleges have been turning to the church , calling their pastors , and pastors are calling their bishops and asking what to expect , mr corbett said the bishops wanted to send a clear message of solidarity on many other priorities , the bishops may find common cause with mr trump they are eager to see him follow through with campaign promises to end or limit abortion , reverse the contraception mandate in the affordable care act and create exemptions for religious people and institutions objecting to same sex marriage however , the protection of immigrants is not only a biblical imperative for catholic leaders but also a matter of pastoral care more than one third of american catholics are now latinos , and many others are immigrants from dozens of other countries latinos represent the future of the church sixty percent of catholics in the united states younger than 18 are latino , and 90 percent of them were born here the bishops of the united states recognize the presence of latinos in our community , in our country and also in the church , archbishop gomez said of his election at a news conference in baltimore i think our mission is to help people be united in our country , and have hope archbishop gomez is in line to become the first latino president of the bishops conference he was appointed to lead the los angeles archdiocese , the largest in the nation , in 2010 by pope benedict xvi , who preceded pope francis the archbishop is a member of the catholic group opus dei and is seen as a conservative on doctrine it surprised many church observers when pope francis recently passed over archbishop gomez in naming new cardinals three from the united states because los angeles is usually a cardinals seat beginning in january , catholic dioceses are undertaking a nearly two year initiative to reach out to hispanic catholics and better integrate them into the church pope francis , the first pope from latin america , applauded the effort in a video message to the bishops , suggesting that it could have a broader impact for a society gripped by disconcerting social , cultural and spiritual shifts , and increasing polarization the election starkly revealed the polarization not only within the country , but also within the church white catholics preferred mr trump over hillary clinton , 60 percent to 37 percent , while hispanic catholics favored mrs clinton over mr trump , 67 percent to 26 percent , according to an analysis by the pew research center the catholic church is the largest in the country , with 68 million members and about 23 percent of the electorate
the house of representatives voted overwhelmingly on tuesday for legislation to extend american sanctions on iran for 10 years , a move that proponents called critical economic leverage to ensure iranian compliance with an international nuclear agreement the legislation , known as the iran sanctions extension act , needs senate approval and president obamas signature before the end of the year , when american sanctions are set to expire under the nuclear agreement , which took effect in january , between iran and six world powers including the united states , many economic sanctions were suspended or relaxed in exchange for irans verifiable pledges of peaceful nuclear work but the deal also contained a snapback provision that would allow for the reimposition of sanctions if iran were found to have violated the terms the legislation approved by the house on tuesday would also extend longstanding american sanctions against iran that predate the dispute over that countrys nuclear activities iran has increasingly complained about these non nuclear sanctions , particularly the prohibition on iranian access to the american financial system and use of the dollar the iranians say such restrictions have discouraged many foreign companies from investing in iran , subverting the economic rewards it expected from the nuclear agreement republicans and many democrats opposed the agreement , asserting that iran was untrustworthy and had gained too many concessions during the negotiations president elect donald j trump said during his campaign that he would renegotiate the accord or renounce it in a march speech to the american israel public affairs committee , the most powerful pro israel lobby group in washington , he said his top priority was to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran whether he will follow through on that pledge remains unclear the other countries that agreed to the deal with iran britain , china , france , germany and russia have said they intend to honor it president franois hollande of france said on tuesday that he did not believe mr trump would scrap the agreement , telling the france 24 television channel that the absence of an accord would be very serious iranian leaders , reacting to mr trumps victory , have also asserted that he will not be able to undo the agreement president hassan rouhani of iran told his cabinet ministers the day after the american election that the agreement cannot be overturned by one governments decision , according to the official islamic republic news agency on monday , 76 national security experts , including former officials of republican and democratic administrations , exhorted mr trump not only to accept the nuclear agreement but to use it as a way to ease tensions with iran on other longstanding problems

a federal program meant to encourage investment in the united states from wealthy foreigners is increasingly supporting large luxury real estate projects , not the development in the rural and downtrodden districts that some say were the original targets of the program with billions of dollars flowing in , mostly from wealthy chinese , the program faces an uncertain future in september , congress reset the expiration date on parts of the so called eb 5 program to dec 9 the program grants permanent residency in the united states to those who are willing to immigrate and invest 500 , 000 in a business that creates at least 10 jobs many of the projects that have received money have been in real estate , though investments have also gone to charter schools , medical centers and manufacturing plants some 15 billion of investments have been made through the program since 2005 , according to the eb 5 coalition , an industry group in washington critics have derided the program as essentially a legal way for immigrants to buy their way into the country donald j trumps election adds a new wrinkle he campaigned heavily on immigration reform , pledging to build a wall on the mexican border and increase the deportation of criminal noncitizens he also said he wanted to reduce legal immigration and ensure jobs are offered to americans first whether president elect trump will actually follow through on these pledges remains to be seen , said stephen w yale loehr , a law professor at cornell university and an immigration lawyer it is always difficult for congress to enact significant immigration changes because immigration is so complex and controversial the united states is not alone in offering residence for investment germany , australia and canada have versions of the program , as do several small countries competition among caribbean nations is rising for their citizenship by investment programs , with st lucia being the most recent to revamp its program foreign interest is growing according to an analysis by professors at new york university , investments in the program are increasingly financing large scale , luxury or entertainment oriented real estate developments among them nearly 1 billion gathered in the last year from 2 , 000 investors to build a chinese style casino in las vegas , 600 million from 1 , 200 investors for new yorks mixed use hudson yards project and 150 million from 300 investors to construct the beverly hills waldorf astoria the program was intended to reward people for putting money into the united states projects that raised more than 1 billion were practically nonexistent in the program before 2010 , prof jeanne calderon of new york universitys stern school of business wrote in a march report on the program but when banks turned off the credit spigot around the 2008 financial crisis , developers started getting more creative in finding alternative financing n y u tracks 27 projects across the united states that have raised more than 5 6 billion from foreign investors many of these projects are run by large commercial developers who could proceed without any foreign investment but are reaching out to foreign investors for cheaper financing than they would receive from banks reformers from both political parties are calling for a much tighter definition of the areas eligible for investment through the program to remove the tracts in prosperous urban areas and get money to underserved ones they are also looking at raising the investment minimum to 800 , 000 in addition , they hope to make the projects more accountable by requiring better disclosures to protect potentially vulnerable immigrants from fraudulent schemes federal securities regulators have filed several enforcement actions against people committing fraud through the program in recent years the issue has friends and foes on either side of the political aisle senators from rural parts of the country want more development dollars coming to their districts , while those from large cities want to maintain the status quo as for the immigrants themselves , they are entering the program mostly in an effort to gain permanent residency in the united states , which gives project developers more power like so many things , there are a lot of people who are adversely affected but only by a little , and there are a very small group of developers who benefit they win , said david north , a fellow at the center for immigration studies in washington the beverly hills waldorf astoria is being developed by beny alagem , an israeli born american entrepreneur who also owns the beverly hilton it has nine acres and 12 stories and includes a hotel and a residential condominium tower three hundred investors contributed 150 million to the project in the form of a loan it is estimated to create 3 , 629 jobs the wanda group , which is the largest commercial developer in china and is owned by the nations richest man , is said to be seeking foreign investment program financing for its wanda vista hotel in chicago the city approved the project last november the wanda group is also developing one beverly hills hotel next to the new waldorf in that city the genting group , a global development conglomerate based in malaysia , is developing resorts world las vegas with nearly 1 billion of program money the 4 billion project includes 3 , 100 rooms and 100 , 000 square feet of gambling space , restaurants , shops , a panda habitat and a 4 , 000 seat theater jeffrey berkowitz is developing skyrise

in the music business , when you disappear for a long stretch of time , you abandon your right to grouse about how things have changed in your absence nostalgia is a cheap crutch and a lame weapon when the whole world is changing , though , disappearing and then re emerging in different circumstances can be more deeply destabilizing the things you held dear might be missing , or under attack adjusting is a full time job last week , the members of a tribe called quest , one of the essential groups of the 1990s , came back after nearly two decades into a hip hop world that had iterated a dozen or more times they didnt flinch and they returned in a moment when americas racial tensions were at an outrageous level they stepped into action its been 18 years since a tribe called quest released an album enough time for eight years of george w bush and almost eight years of barack obama , for lil wayne and kendrick lamar , sept 11 and black lives matter , drake and young thug , the rise of streaming and the fall of the record store in its day , the group was at the vanguard of hip hops progressive wing , an exquisite balance of philosophical and attitudinal , melodic inventiveness and subwoofer thump its internal politics were sometimes rancorous , though , which meant that last years reunion was a pleasant surprise the members were recording the often stunning new album , we got it from here thank you 4 your service , when phife dawg , one of the groups rappers , died in march the record reckons with shifting sands , both internal and external , personal and political but strikingly , not musical the groups commitment to its history and sonic signatures is intact , and impressive , and rewarding in truth , its hard to tell if the version of a tribe called quest captured on this album the core members q tip , phife and ali shaheed muhammad the sometime member jarobi white , here back on equal footing and the longtime associates de facto affiliates consequence and busta rhymes is even paying much mind to the surrounding music world the musicians giddiness at working together , at being in the same room , is palpable they trade lines with a bubbly verve , the sort of eager overlap that comes from working in close quarters with old friends it all makes for an album that interweaves social and political truth telling with extreme personal joy , all under a cloud of heartache the range of grief and grievance q tip spans on this album is dizzying his voice is still piercingly nasal , his lyrics full of tightly condensed abstractions used to see the tv screen as the place to land my dream in on songs like kids and ego , he raps with wisdom earned over years while still acknowledging the knuckleheaded power of the version of himself that once was young q tips production on the album manages to thicken the groups traditional sumptuous warmth for the modern ear its old sound amplified , not rebuilt without tinkering too intensely with the old component parts a therapeutic low end , stinging drums , unlikely samples , a rich understanding of how genres bleed into one another phife was as sharp as ever here , full of his slick sports metaphors , and also serious about structural social inequality , as on whateva will be a cavalcade of guests show up to pay respect andr 3000 delivers a characteristically mercurial verse on kids , elton john plays relaxed piano on the strolling solid wall of sound , jack white peels off a caustic guitar solo at the end of lost somebody , kendrick lamar delivers angry grit on conrad tokyo and kanye west bellows a hook on the killing season and the verses from jarobi white , long the groups lost member , suggest a great hip hop career that never was on the killing season , hes scathing , invoking and updating strange fruit these fruitful trees are rooted in bloody soil and torment things havent really changed or theyre dormant for the moment while this reunion cum tribute album was born of personal need , it ends up rising to meet a social and political moment it couldnt have wholly anticipated \( though on conrad tokyo , phife does refer to donald j trump hosting saturday night live last year troublesome times , kid no time for comedy \) on saturday night , the group was the musical guest on saturday night live for the first episode after the contentious election dave chappelle was the host , and the episode tried hard to grapple with the countrys new political uncertainty the group performed we the people and the space program , two of the more bluntly political songs on the new album at the end of the space program , the group was joined onstage by consequence and busta rhymes all of them chanted lets make something happen , then gathered for a deep embrace , heads down that gesture was a security blanket and a balm a healing of a still fresh wound , and a model for gathering love in the face of unpredictable trauma
miami to chad olin , it seemed like the perfect opportunity decades of animosity between the united states and cuba were peeling away , opening a final frontier in the caribbean to dollar wielding americans mr olin , 30 , a harvard business school graduate , gave up a career in private equity to break into the cuba travel market he started a company that organizes trips for millennials to legally visit cuba a business made possible because president obama has broadened travel to the island and expanded licenses for americans to do business there so what happens now , mr olin wonders on the campaign trail , president elect donald j trump threatened to roll back the sweeping dtente with cuba , lambasting the concessions made to its communist government and raising the possibility that one of mr obamas signature foreign policy initiatives could be stripped away i am still trying to think about what this means for my business that i spent literally the last two years working on , setting up something that was going to be perfect for an open market , mr olin said if we go back to the old way , i dont know if i have a business its a huge blow hundreds of thousands of people have taken advantage of mr obamas decisions to loosen travel and other restrictions on cuba more americans and cuban migrs now travel to cuba , and the number of americans who visited the country rose by 50 percent last year , according to the state news media more cubans receive money transfers and parcels theres a four points sheraton in havana , and three more hotels are set to open airbnb rents private rooms , and american airlines is about to start direct flights to havana for them , and mr olin , the critical question remains whether mr trump , a real estate mogul and hotel developer , will be a businessman at heart and allow mr obamas measures to continue or if he will instead keep a vow he made and scale back everything from diplomatic relations to the unlimited rum and cigars mr obama recently allowed from cuba such a move by mr trump would underscore the shifting relations between the united states and cuba , which have long depended on who occupied the oval office several large european investment groups have asked me to take the trump magic to cuba , mr trump once wrote in a 1999 editorial in the miami herald supporting the trade embargo against cuba my investment in cuba would directly subsidize the oppression of the cuban people , he said at the time but id rather lose those millions than lose my self respect mr trump has , at other times , been vague on the issue during the primary contest , he repeatedly said he thought restoring diplomatic relations with cuba was fine , but added that the united states and the cuban people did not get enough in return but as the election approached , mr trump grew less equivocal in march , he told cnn that he would probably continue having diplomatic relations with cuba , but he said he would want much better deals than were making then , mr trump took a harder line in miami this fall all of the concessions barack obama has granted the castro regime were done through executive order , which means the next president can reverse them , and that i will do unless the castro regime meets our demands , mr trump said at a campaign event in september not my demands our demands vice president elect mike pence reaffirmed that stance on twitter , saying mr trump would repeal mr obamas executive orders unless there was real political and religious freedom asked by a reporter if his comments meant he would break off diplomatic relations with cuba , mr trump suggested that he might , and said he probably would not appoint an ambassador to cuba the agreement president obama signed is a very weak agreement , he said we get nothing the people of cuba get nothing , and i would do whatever is necessary to get a good agreement robert l muse , a lawyer who specializes in united states cuba trade law , said mr trump seemed to believe that washington had struck a single deal with cuba , when in reality there are several agreements that range from direct mail to managing oil spills mr trump could pick through them one by one to eliminate the ones he dislikes and keep others but mr muse said the american government could be financially liable if it pulled out the rug from under companies that had acted in good faith rescinding enhanced travel that obama has introduced would be the most tragic thing trump might do , but i dont think he will , mr muse said he has invested a lifetime in travel , resorts and hotel accommodations , and its a global enterprise it seems counterintuitive what else could mr trump do \? change travel rules tourism to cuba is still illegal under the embargo , but president bill clinton was the first to allow people to people excursions that allow travelers to go if the trip is , for example , for educational or religious purposes president george w bush scrapped those , and then mr obama expanded them so that travelers no longer needed to get special permission first under mr bush , a cuban american could visit once every three years now , its unlimited end regularly scheduled commercial flights to cuba cuba and the united states agreed to allow up to 90 daily round trip flights between the nations , the department of transportation said southwest began its service on sunday , and american airlines is set to start flights to havana on nov 28 we are full steam ahead and cant speculate as to
the wall on the left side of nearys , a green canopied irish restaurant and bar on east 57th street that will celebrate its 50th anniversary next year , is covered with framed photos of politicians considered liberal hillary and bill clinton , ted kennedy , chris dodd , hugh carey and michael bloomberg rudy giuliani , perhaps surprisingly , is up there , too on the right wall are george bush the elder and the younger , dick cheney and ronald reagan though donald j trump he has been a patron , he is not yet on either wall but since mr trump , the president elect , announced his candidacy 500 odd days ago , the bar has served as a refuge , a safe space for that rare creature a trump supporter in new york city one hundred percent , its why i spend so much time in here , christophe lirola , an investment banker , said while seated at the bar drinking a beer i love having conversations with people about politics , and many places you cant really do that because then its like the wolves surrounding the sheep on mr lirolas right , mark guest , a security consultant who looks after celebrities and fashion designers , said he didnt vote for mr trump but plans to give him a chance whats the show me state , missouri \? mr guest said i think we are a country of show me you made a claim \? it might have been audacious , like p t barnum youre a salesman , a huckster , a hustler , a barker \? o k you made a claim \? prove us wrong thats what our democracys about kevin philzone , known as duffy , began bartending at nearys right after elaines , a joint of equal repute , closed in 2011 he said that he was behind trump from the very beginning and shocked when he won i told everybody i thought it was going to be really hairy , really close , he said mr philzone met mr trump a couple of times at elaines and said he even witnessed him behaving in a crass manner but if you work in construction , youve got to have that in your repertoire , he said its part of your game a suave older gent , lee peck , was sitting by himself at the end of the bar and looking amused mr peck , a retired banker , has been going to nearys since the early 1970s we used to come up here friday nights after work and sit at the bar , he said a lot of friday nights its a great watering hole , a lot of good people mr peck , though a longtime conservative , voted for hillary clinton trump just turned me off , but hes president , so i have to root for him so hopefully hes going to be o k , he said , and then gestured toward the owner of the bar , jimmy neary jimmy loves him hes always been a big trump guy yes , i like donald trump , said mr neary , 86 , who bears some resemblance to clarence , the angel in its a wonderful life he was sitting in one of the red leather corner banquettes and remembering how mr trumps relatives and friends have been visiting his establishment since the era when mr trump was dating marla maples and palling around with frank and kathie lee gifford to me , hes an absolute gentleman , mr neary said thats all i can say for him though happy to talk politics , he didnt mind returning the subject to his restaurant , which opened on st patricks day in 1967 the first year was mediocre , not bad , he said and then i came in here one evening at 6 oclock , it was a nice crowd here , and i heard customers at the bar saying , he doesnt know whos here quietly , i disappeared and went into the kitchen and looked out of the glass window , and who was sitting in the corner \? john glenn and i said to myself , if i wasnt in business another week , i still had the first man to orbit the earth in my restaurant \( well , the first american , anyway \) gov hugh carey was one of the first politicians to become a regular , back when he had just started his seven term congressional run the kennedys came , and the clintons , and mayor bloomberg , who took mr neary to ireland on his private jet to visit the village where the proprietor was born kareem abdul jabbar has been there , too gay talese went for dinner recently mary higgins clark is a regular , and mr neary has shown up as a character in 21 of her novels and even solves a murder in one with his wife of 40 years , eileen \( now in heaven \) , he raised four children his daughter una neary is at the restaurant on the weekends , usually in a hostess role but always available to fill in as a waitress , if needed she is also a partner at goldman sachs , the head of bank holding company compliance on veterans day at the bar , ms neary recognized the countrys servicemen and women , then added today is also another extra special day because on 11 11 1954 , is when my father came to america the place erupted with cheering and clapping then ms neary asked everyone to sing god bless america , which they did with gusto
to the editor when senate republicans decided that president obama should not be allowed to fill a supreme court vacancy in the last year of his term , they claimed that blocking his nominee was necessary to protect the will of the american people the election revealed the will of the people , albeit a will thwarted by the electoral college a clear majority voted against donald trump after the republican controlled senate nonetheless confirms mr trumps nominee to fill a vacancy that ought not to exist , it will be time to recognize that the court has lost its legitimacy as an independent judicial institution the former supreme court will soon be better understood as a g o p headquarters in black robes mitchell zimmerman palo alto , calif the writer is an attorney
from the start , the central enigma was donald j trump how did this loose lipped celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so far \? who were the americans supporting him and why \? when i started my unusual assignment of covering the american presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent for this , an american news organization one of the first things i did was to invite questions from international readers the bulk of them revolved around mr trump , whose unorthodox romp through the republican primaries propelled him to the partys nomination and ultimately to the presidency going back through my monthslong journey across america , there were many clues to mr trumps rising tide , although not all were easy to read i drank with trump supporters in bars and casinos i approached them at rodeos i chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies the broad topography of trump country is , in many respects , easy to trace it is a place of anger and frustration , gripped by a feverish anti establishment sentiment people wanted change and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life yet other factors were at play , too , in this unruly insurgency , factors that sometimes made it hard to see clearly racism , xenophobia , bigotry , talk radio , social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country it wasnt always clear which elements were powering the trump train , as the movement called itself , and which were being buoyed along one of my first stops was williamson , a decimated coal town in west virginia it had a sports bar , which offered beer for 1 on thursdays , and a biker bar where , it was said , patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke both were filled with trump voters , little surprise since he had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the obama administrations environmental regulations and cheap natural gas in williamson , i also saw how mr trumps message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core republican constituency in conversations after church on sunday , many christians glossed over the candidates three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease \( its scary , like vietnam , mr trump told howard stern in 1997 \) it was hard to square , but perhaps that was the lesson that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this election , one in which outrageous rule breaking might offer a route to success around that time , apple released its seventh iteration of the iphone , that glossy black totem of progress inscribed on the back of every iphone are the words designed in california assembled in china as if california is a separate country and thats how many in trump country saw it that instead of being part of the iphone economy , they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas one thing that i , like many europeans and other foreigners , had long seen as distinguishing the united states was its restless optimism and innate self belief mr trump , though , traded on pessimism his slogan , make america great again , embodied a nativist vision that aimed to restore pride in the countrys military and business , but also scapegoated immigrants , minorities and muslims at mr trumps rallies , most of the faces in the crowd were white people flew confederate flags they spoke impatiently about the blacks broad brush prejudice toward muslims was openly expressed danny popma , a factory owner in michigan , told me that children in dearborn , which has the countrys largest percentage of muslims , had stayed home from school in droves on sept 11 because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks the atmosphere at trump rallies was permissive if someone said something offensive or loutish , there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted yet in another confounding twist , a significant minority of trump supporters were minorities themselves i met people who defied neat categorization a black woman in her 20s who worked at a record label in miami a japanese uber driver in las vegas a guyanese doorman in queens , n y at a rally in the campaigns final week in michigan , a rust belt state that would prove central to mr trumps victory , i saw how the candidate connected with crowd when he spoke , it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his ear , listening for the smallest murmur of applause , which he would seize upon and amplify it reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians id seen during my years based in pakistan what was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating maybe these were just the hard core loyalists state by state polls suggested that mr trump was behind in many places critical to electoral college victory political professionals , including republicans , dismissed the notion that mr trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters its like the hunt for the lost tribes of the amazon , was how stuart stevens , a consultant who had worked for the 2012 republican nominee , mitt romney , put it early on if you paddle your canoe far enough up the river , and bang your drum hard enough , they will come to the riverbank but theyre just not there but when i mentioned the polls showing mr trump lagging to his supporters , they snorted derisively everyone they knew was voting trump colleagues , relatives ,
post truth has been named oxford dictionaries 2016 international word of the year , vanquishing a politically charged field that included adulting , alt right , brexiteer , glass cliff and woke the use of post truth defined as relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief increased by 2 , 000 percent over last year , according to analysis of the oxford english corpus , which collects roughly 150 million words of spoken and written english from various sources each month katherine connor martin , the head of united states dictionaries at oxford university press , said it surged most sharply in june after the brexit vote and donald j trumps securing the republican nomination for president , making it an unusually global word what we found especially interesting is that it encapsulated a trans atlantic phenomenon , she said often , when looking at words , youll find one thats a really big deal in the u k but not in the u s the term , whose first known usage in this particular sense was in a 1992 essay in the nation magazine citing the iran contra scandal and the persian gulf war , does not represent an entirely new concept but it does , ms martin said , reflect a step past truthiness , the stephen colbert coinage that merriam webster and the american dialect society each chose as its word of the year a decade ago truthiness is a humorous way of discussing a quality of specific claims , she said post truth is an adjective that is describing a much bigger thing its saying that the truth is being regarded as mostly irrelevant oxfords word of the year is chosen to reflect the ethos , mood or preoccupations of a given year , but also to highlight the fact that english is always changing last years winner wasnt a word at all , but the face with tears of joy emoji \( sigh that was then \) in 2014 , the laurel went to vape some of the items on this years shortlist may prove ephemeral , like coulrophobia extreme or irrational fear of clowns which surged after a rash of reports of scary clowns that belongs to a really interesting class of words , labeled rare in the dictionary , that are usually only trotted out when people want to say , theres a word for that , ms martin said others , like alt right , seem likely to have more staying power , though that term has come under semantic attack from some on the left in recent days , those critics have stepped up arguments that it as an overly cute perhaps even post truth \? euphemism for white supremacy ms martin said that oxfords definition an ideological grouping associated with extreme conservative or reactionary viewpoints , characterized by a rejection of mainstream politics and by the use of online media to disseminate deliberately controversial content was a particularly difficult one to research and write in general , she said , it is not used as a simple synonym for white supremacy , though some who embrace the term do openly acknowledge its usefulness in softening and selling extreme ideas what i would say as a lexicographer , she said , is that in choosing whether to say alt right or white supremacist , its important to know what you mean
when thinking about any new president , and the harm or good he might do , we usually begin with his legislative agenda the achievements that define a presidency often come early , so in the traditional model , a president rides the momentum of electoral success by quickly moving an ambitious agenda through congress it wont all happen in 100 days as in franklin d roosevelts time , but typically theres only a short window for a president to get his proposals passed before attention shifts to the midterm campaigns its doubtful that donald j trump has even a grade school civics class idea of how a bill becomes a law , so its long been assumed that his legislative agenda will be house speaker paul ryans the speaker will get his bills passed , with republican control of both houses of congress , and mr trump will sign them no doubt mr ryan has an agenda its in the budgets he proposed starting in 2011 , as chairman of the house budget committee , and most recently in a pamphlet called a better way , copies of which he is never without each year , a high priority for him has been a sweeping reform of medicare , establishing a system in which some older americans would get a voucher to buy health coverage on the open market mr ryan would also like to convert medicaid to block grants to states , repeal and replace the affordable care act , and enact major reform of both individual and corporate taxation mr ryan probably has enough votes for these changes he did get his budgets passed in the house but even so , the path from these rough outlines to legislation a president can sign is inevitably long and treacherous some republicans worried about re election will resist the medicare changes , which hit their base of older voters , and democrats should and will mobilize to make this unpopular change a 2018 election issue other members will demand alterations in his proposals to benefit a company in their district , or a big campaign donor if mr ryans medicaid block grants arent as generous to states as the current system , some republican governors will object , backed up by their representatives accommodating them will require spending more money , defeating mr ryans original purpose repealing the affordable care act might seem like a one sentence bill , but mr trump and many members of congress have said they want to keep its popular provisions , such as the requirement to cover pre existing conditions insurers will balk at that requirement in the absence of either the mandate or federal subsidies , which discourage people from postponing buying health insurance until they get sick the health care act is interconnected in ways that will make it hard to separate the popular provisions from the unpopular , and in seven years , republicans still havent filled in the blank second part of repeal and replace problems like these will appear all along the way , as any major bill winds through one or more committees in each house , is amended on each floor and finally consolidated into a single bill for the president hundreds of lobbyists will converge on the process , pitching modifications large , small and often contradictory there will be dozens of conflicts to resolve and choices to make that will be true of tax as well as health legislation the republican house couldnt get a major tax reform to the floor in 2014 , even after dave camp , the michigan republican who led the house ways and means committee , spent years on the details read any of the long books written about significant legislative victories , and even with one party control , its always a high wire act , full of moments when leaders pull the bill back from the brink of failure or force difficult votes keeping the process on track requires a president who is fully engaged , making calls to the hill , intervening to resolve conflicts , and providing technical support through competently staffed federal agencies it helps a lot if the president is popular and members want to be associated with him ronald reagans approval rating was almost 60 percent around the time congress enacted his sweeping tax and budget cuts in 1981 even right after the election , mr trumps favorability ratings were comparable to richard m nixons in the depths of watergate , and he lost the popular vote nor does mr trump have warm relationships with members of congress most have never met him , and others he has viciously attacked mr trump does have the roughest outlines of a legislative agenda of his own rebuild our infrastructure , fix our inner cities democrats welcome the idea of infrastructure spending and have said they would work with the new president to achieve it but its far from mr ryans priorities , and conservative members of the house freedom caucus will object to the increased federal spending theres also no precedent for a new president to work mainly with the minority party to devise a bill the agenda is set by the majority yes , senate republicans may eliminate the filibuster or do as much as possible through the process of budget reconciliation , so they wont necessarily need 60 votes for final passage of a bill but thats only one of many obstacles along the way , and with just one vote to spare , getting to 50 can be as hard as getting to 60 was during the brief period when mr obama had the advantage of a senate majority he still had to convince wavering democratic senators like ben nelson of nebraska , who demanded the much derided cornhusker kickback to be clear , there is much to fear from the incoming administration especially with the modern powers of the presidency
when victoria woodhull ran for president of the united states , she couldnt even vote for herself if the women can be allowed to vote , the new york herald claimed when woodhull announced her bid in 1870 , mrs woodhull may rely on rolling up the heaviest majority ever polled in this or any other nation after all , the paper said , women always take the part of each other the herald called for passage of a womens suffrage amendment , and then victory for victoria in 1872 that was before the sex scandal hit woodhull was a divorced woman , and sexual history was already a point of controversy but soon the papers dredged up a truly salacious item she once shared her home with both her first and second husbands woodhull defended herself in the press she explained that her family had taken in her alcoholic , disabled ex husband as an act of charity , not bigamy but the headlines branded her disgraced and called her career busted woodhull was evicted from her home and forced to withdraw her 11 year old daughter from school the cartoonist thomas nast literally drew her as the devil and the conventional wisdom that women would always support each other turned on its head the suffragist support that had boosted woodhulls candidacy fractured a columnist for the cincinnati commercial wrote that while under certain circumstances , men may vote for a candidate who is somewhat less than immaculate , a female candidate must present as a paragon of propriety if she hoped to secure the feminine vote of the country in support of her political ambition in 2016 , the theory that women would vote together in the interest of their gender soared and crashed once again this was supposed to be the election where women formed a coalition to block the man who boasted of groping them who has been accused of sexual assault by more than a dozen women who said women who have abortions deserved to be punished who said women facing sexual harassment at work should find another career who implied that a female journalist was on her period when he didnt like her question who said his female opponent didnt look presidential it was supposed to be the election in which women rejected the candidate who hates women in favor of the candidate who is one instead , although hillary clinton won women last week cnn exit polls showed that 54 percent of women voted for her she also lost women the womens vote was drawn and quartered by race , education , geography and marriage 94 percent of black women voted for clinton , while 53 percent of white women voted for donald j trump 53 percent of married women voted for him 62 percent of white women who didnt attend college did , too over all , initial polls suggest that female voters were slightly less likely to vote for the democrat than they were in 2012 and the most offensive thing mitt romney ever said about women was that he had consulted binders full of their rsums in order to hire them to his staff the idea of a womens vote is both a lofty american dream and an ugly little myth its been in circulation before women could legally cast a ballot in 1858 , a proponent of womens suffrage argued in the new york times that women display more of the virtues of good citizens , forethought , temperance , industry , and self restraint than men do and in 1871 , susan b anthony claimed that when women earned the right to vote , theyd collectively seize the moral high ground female voters propose to do away with vice and immorality , to prevent the social evil sex work by giving women remunerative employment , to forbid the sale of spiritous liquors and tobacco and to teach men a higher and nobler life than the one they now follow , she said one man at a new york parlor meeting in 1894 said he supported womens suffrage only because he knew it would not challenge the status quo if there was danger that women might overthrow anything good , he said , there might be a reason to prevent their voting last week , on election day , female clinton supporters traveled to the new york cemetery where susan b anthony is buried they wore yellow roses and affixed their i voted stickers to her tombstone in an act of feminist tribute but the suffragists who fought for a womans right to vote were invested in enfranchising a particular kind of woman their pitch for womens political consciousness was rooted not in the collective experience of american womanhood , but in an image of white feminine virtue many white suffragists pointedly ignored the women of color in the movement rosalie jones , a white socialite turned suffragist , gave herself the title of general and led an army of women from new york to washington in 1913 when a group of southern men confronted her to ask if she favored suffrage for black women , she hedged , telling them that the states must solve their own problems and when a group of black women tried to join her march in maryland , she refused to acknowledge their existence they took up the back of the line for a few hundred feet before falling away in 1894 , a white woman at a meeting of the brooklyn woman suffrage association complained that new york had become asylum for the trash of all nations and argued that womens suffrage ought to be carefully restricted to keep undesirable women out of the ballot box think what it means to give it to all women , she said our criminal and pauper men have wives there are thousands of female operatives in tobacco factories and similar fields of labor there are
all models are wrong , the statistician george box once said this year was no exception on oct 18 , a model built by donald j trumps campaign gave him an 8 percent chance of winning , bloomberg has reported at that point in the race , the upshots model gave him the same chances by election day , his odds were higher , but mr trump was still not favored to win near the end of the race , a model built by the republican national committee showed him losing over all and in states like florida , iowa , pennsylvania and wisconsin , according to politico \( he won each of those states \) so did mr trump simply beat the odds \? or were the odds wrong all along \? one of the reasons assessing models is so tricky is that its difficult to know for sure its only over the long run that a model can be judged to be well calibrated \( or not \) what we can do , though , is check to see how fragile our model was to different assumptions what we said on the last day of the campaign , based on pre election polls , we said mrs clinton had about an 85 percent chance of winning and mr trump 15 percent , or slightly less than a one in six shot the final result is , of course , far from what we thought was the single most likely outcome , and our live forecast was quick to adjust as votes began coming in but mr trumps final electoral count most likely 306 to mrs clintons 232 , once the race in michigan has been called is well within the range of what we said was plausible the chart below shows which outcomes we thought were most likely were we too slow \? at various points during the campaign , nate silver , the editor of fivethirtyeight , called the upshots model slow to react to new polls we preferred stable yougov analysis suggested that very few voters changed their minds and that the impact of most campaign events was small given the amount of uncertainty in the race , a model should not overreact to a single poll released three months before election day but in her post election analysis , mrs clinton blamed letters from the f b i director , james b comey , delivered to congress 11 and two days before election day and campaign models moved sharply in the last few weeks , as did our own so what if we had used only the final 10 days of polls \? would we have given mr trump higher odds \? we would have , but not by much if we had used only the final 10 days of polls , we would have given mrs clinton about an 80 percent chance of winning , only slightly lower than what we actually said and still far above 50 percent even shorter windows give similar results theres no window of polls that would have pushed mr trump to be the favorite what if we had assumed michigan , pennsylvania and wisconsin would all shift together \? in addition to whether older polls are useful , one of the biggest differences between models involved the question of how much the states move together does a polling miss in one state tell you much about a polling miss in other states \? the technical word for this is correlation if the states are more correlated , the possible distribution of outcomes gets wider if the states move independently , the distribution gets narrower our model kept this parameter at a middle value the states were neither perfectly correlated nor perfectly independent even at its most extreme , making the states move together more flattens the distribution and makes a win from mr trump more likely , but at best he would have been just a 24 percent favorite what if wed fit our model somehow knowing the results of 2016 \? it probably would not have changed much the state polls missed by larger margins in 2016 than they had in recent elections , but the results werent completely unexpected it feels like an even larger miss because the polls missed by enough in enough swing states to give the election to the trailing candidate via the electoral college national polling performed better than a lot of people think mrs clinton is increasing her lead in the popular vote by the day it may take months for analysts to determine why state polls were far off in the midwest and northeast modern polling faces challenges , including the decreasing use of landlines and the increasing difficulty in finding people willing to participate , but we can expect the polling industry to work to adapt what would we do differently \? what would we think next time about a state like wisconsin \? dozens of polls showed clinton with a lead , most above four points none showed mr trump ahead in our polling database of presidential polls since 1980 , we found 248 examples in which a candidate led in every poll of a state conducted in the final 150 days of the campaign , including 49 where the margin was within 10 points \( excluding states with only one poll \) the trailing candidate won in only two cases three if you count wisconsin \( the others were north carolina in 1980 and south dakota in 1992 in each case , every poll showed the democrat ahead , and the republican candidate won the state \) even among races won by less than 10 points , thats a win rate of 94 percent about the same as the 93 percent chance we gave mrs clinton in wisconsin all models are wrong , mr box said , continuing but some are useful was the upshot forecast useful
washington the expansion of medicaid , a central pillar of the affordable care act , faces immense uncertainty next year , with president elect donald j trump and top republicans in congress embracing proposals that could leave millions of poorer americans without health insurance and jeopardize a major element of president obamas legacy but influential figures in surprising quarters of the new administration might balk at a broad rollback of medicaids reach , favoring new conditions for access to the government insurance program for the poor but not wholesale cutbacks mike pence , the vice president elect , is proud of the medicaid expansion he engineered as governor of indiana , one of 31 states that expanded eligibility under the affordable care act the indiana program has conservative features that emphasize personal responsibility and require medicaid beneficiaries to make monthly contributions to savings accounts earmarked for health care another trump adviser , gov chris christie of new jersey , hails the expansion of medicaid in his state , saying more than half a million people are receiving more and better health care the federal government pays the full cost for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016 and at least 90 percent of the costs in later years under the health law it is hard to overstate the importance of medicaid , which insures 77 million people , pays for more than half of all births in some states , covers about two thirds of nursing home residents and provides treatment for many people addicted to opioids spending on medicaid , by the federal government and states combined , exceeds 500 billion a year of the 20 million people who have gained coverage under the affordable care act , officials estimate , 12 million are insured by medicaid with few of the problems that have plagued the new insurance exchanges , or marketplaces but change is coming in his campaign manifesto , mr trump said congress must repeal the affordable care act and give each state a lump sum of federal money a block grant for medicaid congress passed legislation in january to repeal the health law and roll back its medicaid expansion mr obama vetoed the measure , but speaker paul d ryan of wisconsin has vowed to put similar legislation on a republican presidents desk without even waiting for legislation , the trump administration is almost certain to give states more leeway to run their medicaid programs as they wish , federal and state officials say a number of states have already proposed co payments and work requirements for people on medicaid in an effort to protect beneficiaries , the obama administration has limited the use of co payments and has not allowed work requirements but state officials say that such changes are likely to be allowed in some form in a trump administration cindy gillespie , the director of the arkansas department of human services , said that with the election of mr trump , she saw a real chance for states to take back a bit of control over medicaid and other safety net programs darin gordon , who stepped down in june after 10 years as the director of tennessees medicaid program , predicted that there will be greater receptivity in the new administration to state proposals that were shut down by the obama administration cindy mann , the top federal medicaid official from 2009 to january 2015 , said it was entirely possible that a trump administration would make different judgments about medicaid waivers , the vehicle for a wide range of state innovations and experiments the federal government has broad discretion to approve state demonstration projects if the secretary of health and human services finds they are likely to assist in promoting the objectives of the medicaid program on nov 1 , the obama administration rejected a waiver request from new hampshire , which wanted to impose a work requirement and more stringent standards for medicaid beneficiaries to show they were united states citizens and residents of the state the requirements could undermine access , efficiency and quality of care , the administration said new hampshire will have a republican governor for the first time in 12 years and could submit similar proposals to the trump administration in september , the obama administration approved a waiver allowing arizona to charge premiums to people with incomes above the poverty level \( 20 , 160 a year for a family of three \) but federal officials refused to allow work requirements or a time limit on coverage , and they said the state could not charge premiums to people below the poverty level the obama administration also rejected ohios request for a waiver to charge premiums and suspend coverage for people who failed to pay them , a policy it said would jeopardize coverage for more than 125 , 000 people in kentucky , where more than 400 , 000 people have gained coverage because of the expansion of medicaid , gov matt bevin , an outspoken republican critic of the health law , is seeking federal approval for a waiver allowing work requirements , premiums and co payments negotiations over a proposed medicaid block grant would need to answer difficult questions how is the amount of the initial federal allotment determined \? will this amount be adjusted to reflect population growth , the effect of an economic downturn , or increases in the cost of medical care or in consumer prices generally \? will it be adjusted to reflect the advent of costly but effective drugs like those to treat hepatitis c \? will states have to continue spending their own money on medicaid \? will medicaid beneficiaries still have a legally enforceable right an entitlement to coverage and care if they meet eligibility criteria set by the federal government and states \? medicaid block grants have been a favorite of republicans in washington , proposed in various forms by president ronald reagan in
tokyo prime minister shinzo abe of japan is making an urgent trip to new york this week to meet with the american president elect , donald j trump the government in tokyo is on high alert a trump presidency could be the greatest challenge to u s japan relations since the end of world war ii at least if mr trump intends to translate his campaign pledges into actual foreign policy on the stump , he challenged the main tenets of the two countries security relations , as well as americas approach to nuclear deterrence in the asia pacific region and to multilateral trade agreements mr trump has cast unprecedented uncertainty on a partnership that has served japan and america and the rest of the world in good stead the u s japan alliance has been a cornerstone of stability and prosperity in the asia pacific region for decades under the abe administration , the japanese government is both more stable and more nimble today than it has been in years even before the u s election , mr abe had signaled his governments resolve to see japan take on a greater leadership role yet throughout the campaign , mr trump complained that u s japan relations were one sided , with america shouldering too many of the burdens he accused japan , the worlds third largest economy , of being a free rider japan would have to step up , he said , or it would be left to its own devices these charges were off the mark every year the japanese government covers around 75 percent of the costs of maintaining u s military bases in japan , far more than the share that south korea and germany bear for americas military presence in those countries the abe administration has also taken significant , and unpopular , steps to expand japans defense capability in 2015 , it passed security bills that , among other things , authorized the japanese military to engage in combat missions overseas japan also agreed to new defense cooperation guidelines with the u s government that expanded japans role in , for example , enforcing maritime law in the east china sea rather than lambasting japan for not doing enough , mr trump should recognize its recent efforts that would stand a better chance of encouraging tokyo to contribute even more in areas where it can , such as by cooperating with the united states on developing cutting edge defense technology or increasing japans civilian coast guard capacity building in southeast asia mr trump must also reaffirm americas commitment to maintaining the so called nuclear umbrella over japan and south korea , its guarantee to defend its non nuclear allies if they come under attack even while acknowledging that the volatile leadership of north korea is a major security threat , mr trump has suggested that japan and south korea should develop their own nuclear deterrent this caused alarm in japan , prompting the government to declare again that the country will never possess nuclear weapons according to a recent gallup poll , however , 58 percent of the population of south korea is in favor of arming the country with nuclear weapons this is an ominous indicator in order to stem any risk of nuclear proliferation in east asia , the u s government must reaffirm that it will stick by its longstanding nuclear policy in the region another major plank of mr trumps campaign platform was his opposition to globalization and multilateral trade deals like the trans pacific partnership \( t p p \) he said he favored bilateral arrangements instead promising to protect manufacturing jobs for americans , he also said he would seek to impose a 45 percent tariff on chinese exports to the united states the day after mr trumps victory , japans house of representatives ratified the t p p mr abe has said that the deal would not only bring economic benefits but also have awesome strategic value it would indeed confirm the enduring relevance of the rules based liberal international order that has helped maintain peace since world war ii even if the t p p isnt it , mr trump will realize soon enough that , for both economic and strategic reasons , america must participate in multilateral trade agreements in the asia pacific region otherwise , it will be left out , in effect ceding the area to china and its economic expansionism and undermining mr trumps stated resolve to adopt a tougher stance toward china on trade issues mr trumps vision lacks strategic coherence yet this is also an opportunity for japan to help shape americas policies in east asia the japanese and u s governments struggled to forge a common approach to china under the obama administration , with washington wavering between wanting a special relationship with beijing and pushing back against it , especially its aggressive claims over islands in the south china sea tokyo , on the other hand , has been unequivocal in its view that china is a great threat to the continuing development of a rules based order in the region bridging this perception gap should be at the top of mr abes list of issues to address with mr trump he could , for example , propose the isosceles triangle model touted by lee kuan yew , the late prime minister of singapore , as a framework for their discussions mr lee promoted a set of relations among america , japan and china that connected the three countries , but with america and japan at the two closer corners mr abe and mr trump would also do well to explore new areas of cooperation , such as with moscow although russia may seem like a disruptive power from the vantage point of the west , it could be an agent of stability in the asia pacific region mr trump has said he is confident that he
the harvest had just begun when agents from the immigration and naturalization service stormed across the onion fields of vidalia , ga , in 1998 , sweeping up 21 immigrants who were trudging behind tractors without legal authorization to work in the united states , pulling onions out of the ground for 75 cents per 50 pound bag the fallout was unexpected senator paul coverdell , republican of georgia , wrote to the immigration service , complaining of its indiscriminate and inappropriate enforcement tactics , against honest farmers who are simply trying to get their products from the field to the marketplace representative saxby chambliss blasted the immigration officials bullying tactics and immigration enforcement caved shortly after the raid , onion growers in 19 counties were granted a temporary amnesty to keep their workers as long as their paperwork looked legitimate welcome to reality last week , donald j trump was elected president based on a straightforward promise to make the united states great again he aimed his message primarily at tens of millions of white working class americans who feel left behind in the growing economic prosperity , undercut by the advancement of minorities and women , competition from illegal immigrants at home and cheap workers in other countries this week , mr trump is being forced to acknowledge that his straightforward solutions are , in fact , much less straightforward than he promised they would be the big and beautiful wall might look more like a fence most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants wont be summarily deported , he said , backing off a line from stump speeches earlier in the campaign perhaps only two or three million just the bad guys that number is in the ballpark of deportations in the obama administration undocumented immigrants who are not criminals , he said , are terrific people mr trump has not yet clarified his promises on trade , but most experts say it will be very hard to simply walk away from nafta and impose a 45 percent tariff against imports from china in an age of global supply chains , said dani rodrik of the kennedy school of government at harvard , you cannot take a chain saw to trade agreements and not end up cutting your foot off sure but where does that leave donald trumps supporters \? to larry bartels , the political scientist at vanderbilt university , the apparent shift in mr trumps position is unsurprising politicians dont follow the interests of average voters , he argues , they hew to the interests of the rich trumps populist instincts on economic policy seem to have fallen by the wayside over the course of the campaign , mr bartels told me and the need to work with republicans in congress will probably reinforce that shift in his book unequal democracy , published this year , mr bartels offered a snapshot of voter preferences in 2006 , before the onset of the financial crisis on the bottom of the income scale , most voters supported policies to provide jobs and equalize incomes but at the top , most opposed them the picture was reversed when voters were asked about cuts to government spending the rich were much more supportive than the poor and what did voters get \? after a brief flurry of fiscal stimulus to stop the economy from careening into the abyss , they got a round of automatic budget cuts called the sequester the transformation of mr trumps populist agenda into a rather more orthodox list of republican goals may well follow the same script his proposal for huge tax cuts which would reduce federal revenue by as much as 9 5 trillion over a decade , according to the nonpartisan tax policy center would shower favors mostly on upper income americans even as he backs away from mass deportation , mr trump is now talking about modernizing medicare , echoing paul ryan , the house speaker , who wants to weave his goal of replacing government sponsored health care for the elderly with vouchers to buy private insurance into the campaign promise to overhaul the affordable care act what is going to happen is unclear , said jacob hacker , a yale political scientist but what paul ryan will want to do is quite clear finally , while mr trump has pitched deregulation notably the repeal of president obamas clean power plan as an engine for job growth in the nations rust belt , he is also set to deliver enormous gains to wall street by undoing core provisions of the dodd frank act , which was established to hem in the financial sector and prevent a repeat of the crisis of 2008 there is definitely a silver lining if mr trump is really letting go of the most extreme elements of his agenda the economic and social dislocation that would be caused by deporting 5 percent of american workers would be immense nafta may not be the best agreement in the world china certainly cheats but igniting trade wars with the nations biggest trading partners would not improve the livelihoods of americas working class but the only real sliver of good news for blue collar workers , is in mr trumps proposal for infrastructure spending on a yet unspecified but surely huge scale but how will mr trumps base respond if that program is financed largely by temporarily cutting corporate taxes to 10 percent or so to encourage businesses with profits parked abroad to bring them home \? and would it be enough to restore prosperity to the working class \? for decades , political analysts on the left have been perplexed by working class americans who give their vote to a republican party whose motivating principle revolves around delivering tax cuts to the rich this time around , however , they delivered their vote to a republican who promised to directly address their plight he has already come
san francisco social media companies are under increasing scrutiny for the amount of hate speech that thrives on their platforms , especially since the presidential election now , twitter has unveiled several new measures to curb the online abuse , though the changes are unlikely to be far reaching enough to quiet the companys critics on tuesday , twitter said it was making it easier for its users to hide content they do not wish to see on the service and to report abusive posts , even when those messages are directed at other users the company has given its support teams training to better identify mistreatment on twitter theres a fine line between free expression and abuse , and this launch is another step on the path toward getting rid of abuse , said del harvey , twitters vice president of trust and security weve been launching new products to address this , and the cadence of product releases is picking up we have a lot planned on this path online harassment and hate speech have long festered on twitter , but the incidents appeared to rise during the presidential campaign exchanges between supporters of president elect donald j trump and hillary clinton grew personal and acrimonious many of mr trumps supporters also relied on a series of images some anti semitic and others quietly coded as racist to circulate hate speech on twitter since mr trumps victory last week , twitter has been filled with reports of racist and derogatory taunts against minorities many users have expressed fear and concern about the escalation of such behavior when asked about harassment of minorities , mr trump told 60 minutes that his supporters should stop it twitter has not had a comprehensive response for dealing with hate speech , largely because the company did not want to limit freedom of expression on the service but over time , twitter has rolled out measures to tackle the problem it has let people mute the accounts of other users , effectively making their content disappear from view last year , it issued an explicit prohibition against hateful conduct the company is now taking more action it is letting people more specifically block out what they do not want to see on the service , including muting words , phrases and even entire conversations twitter is also making it easier for people to report abusive behavior , even if they are only bystanders to the abuse , and for the company to evaluate those reports and it has overhauled its approach to training support teams , holding special sessions on cultural and historical context for hateful conduct someone looking at user complaints in asia may not recognize something happening in the e u or the u s as hateful , ms harvey said we need to make sure there is a universal familiarity with the most common trends and themes were seeing that are abusive , but may not seem so at first glance critics said that while the steps are positive , they will not eliminate hate speech twitters changes dont stop the problem of posting abusive content , said mark s luckie , a former twitter manager who now runs a digest of the topics trending among twitters african american users called today in blacktwitter people will find a way to abuse others online , but these changes may put users at ease and curb the perception of abuse on twitter part of the reason abuse has thrived on twitter is because the company allows anonymity , mr luckie said but unlike other sites with anonymity , twitter lets users broadcast to the world so their abuse has a huge potential impact , he said if you fight with a celebrity and the celebrity fights back , then you have potentially reached a global audience with your abuse ms harvey acknowledged that twitter has not always moved fast enough to clamp down on abusive behavior she said that the problem would probably never be entirely solved , but that the company was doing more to identify repeat offenders who create new accounts when twitter shuts them down or who incite users to gang up on others when i hear that twitter only cares about this now , that were only going through the motions , i understand where that perception comes from , ms harvey said but this is important to us because people are experiencing these abusive things , and we need to make sure they know what options they have and that were taking action to make things better
beirut , lebanon warplanes resumed airstrikes on the besieged rebel held sections of aleppo , syria , on tuesday , as russia began a major new offensive against insurgents battling syrias president , bashar al assad russias defense minister , sergei k shoigu , said it had started a big operation to deliver massive strikes against the islamic state and the levant victory front , formerly known as the nusra front , in idlib and homs provinces jets taking off from russias aircraft carrier , the admiral kuznetsov , conducted their first strikes on syria , the russian military said , noting that its forces were hitting targets in the two provinces it was unclear whether the strikes on aleppo were by russian or syrian government warplanes the fighting shattered the relative calm that had prevailed in the rebel held eastern parts of aleppo for about three weeks our house is being shaken , modar sheikho , a nurse and antigovernment activist in rebel held aleppo , said in a text message the warplane is still in the sky he shared an audio recording with the roar of a plane and the sound of explosions residents reported airstrikes on at least five aleppo neighborhoods the extent of the casualties was unclear , but they appeared to include at least three civilians , including a woman , who were killed in the neighborhood of masaken hanano , and 10 others who were wounded there were conflicting reports about whether the attack had consisted of barrel bombs , which are usually dropped from helicopters , or an assault by fighter jets since this morning , until now , dozens of shells and rockets have bombed aleppo , mohammad al sheghal , a resident of eastern aleppo , said in a text message , adding that he believed the planes were russian fighter jets mr shoigu , at a meeting in sochi , russia , with president vladimir v putin , said that a russian warship , the admiral grigorovich , was taking part in this operation , launching cruise missiles against insurgent targets for the first time in the history of russian navy , the admiral kuznetsov aircraft carrier took part in combat , too , he said today , our su 33 fighter jets began to work from this warship mr shoigu also briefed mr putin on what he called the use of chemical weapons by the insurgents the russian military said that chemical weapons used by insurgents had caused three deaths of syrian soldiers , and the hospitalization of dozens of soldiers on monday , a russian fighter jet crashed off the syrian coast as it tried to return to the admiral kuznetsov the pilot ejected safely , and the russian defense ministry blamed a technical failure the fighting broke out a day after mr putin spoke to president elect donald j trump and agreed to cooperate on fighting international terrorism and extremism , according to a kremlin statement that declaration echoed mr trumps recent comments that he would try to work with moscow and with mr assad to fight against the islamic state , also known as isis , isil or daesh mr trumps comments concerning syria also received a favorable reaction on tuesday from the united nations special envoy for syria , staffan de mistura what hes been saying is quite interesting , mr de mistura said , speaking on the bbcs hardtalk program the focus , the priority , is daesh , fighting terrorism second to do , if possible , a deal with russia both points make a lot of sense the diplomat said he had yet to speak directly to mr trump or his associates he also emphasized that in his view , the syria conflict still required a completely new approach to what is a political solution the syrian government has tended to call all its opponents terrorists , and russia makes little distinction among the different groups fighting mr assad a constant sticking point has been that some of the rebels that the united states has supported have made battlefield alliances with qaeda linked groups considered terrorists by moscow and washington alike mr de mistura has estimated that perhaps a few hundred of the 10 , 000 or so fighters inside besieged eastern aleppo are affiliated with al qaeda rebels say that number is lower and the government says it is higher the obama administration has said that fighting the islamic state is the priority of the united states , not toppling mr assad though that is another stated american aim under mr obama , the united states government has continued to support some rebel groups that washington deems not to be extremist , and it has shunned direct cooperation with moscow and damascus , contending that their campaign in syria has been focused less on defeating extremists and more on battling opposition groups fighting mr assad the obama administration has also condemned what it says is indiscriminate bombing by the syrian government and its russian allies a change in american policy under mr trump , who is to take office in january , could involve a shift toward direct cooperation with mr assad and with russia against the islamic state
last weeks news quiz covered an extra day in order to take in the results of election 2016 , and most of you did very well there were three questions , however , that stumped many of you one was about the republican majority in the senate , another was about the paris climate change agreement , and the third was our weekly 10th question that asks students to differentiate between fake news and real news we were surprised so many got that one wrong have you paid attention to the news as closely this week as you did last week \? take our quiz and see the photo at the top of this post \? from a nov 10 article , trump and obama hold cordial 90 minute meeting in oval office , the caption reads president obama spoke with president elect donald j trump at the white house on thursday to discuss the transition of power president obama said they had an excellent and wide ranging conversation
mexico city on nov 8 , this mountain capital was soaked by a ferocious off season thunderstorm , the type of tempest that can lead to jokes about the aztec rain god tlaloc being angry at the same time , over the rio grande , a political storm raged worthy of the deitys fury the united states elected a president who promised to build a border wall and make mexico pay for it , deport millions of immigrants and rewrite or rip up a trade deal that mexico depends on for almost a third of its income within hours , an economic storm also seemed to be brewing , with the peso losing value at the fastest rate since the tequila crisis of 1994 the rise of donald j trump to the presidency could potentially be the greatest foreign policy challenge to mexico for generations the actions that mr trump has called for , such as slapping 35 percent tariffs on cars made in mexico , could push this nation of 120 million into recession deporting millions more here could increase unemployment and crime moreover , mr trump could change the basic nature of a relationship that has endured since world war ii from one of peace and trade to one of bullying and conflict the phrase could potentially is key since the election , analysts here have all been trying to predict what a trump presidency will actually do , and whether it will or wont be what he said whatever that is indeed , much of what he has said regarding mexico is highly ambiguous mr trump has veered from calling for a deportation force against all undocumented migrants to a program of sending back criminals , which is in fact the current policy he has pushed for a wall along the entire border , but more recently he has talked about merely extending the existing fences , and hasnt offered a realistic plan for mexico to pay and there is a lot of wiggle room in a revamping of the north american free trade agreement and of course , there are limits to what mr trump can do alone congress , the courts and business will all have much to say on all these issues , and could well force him to take a more moderate position but even if none of these things happen , theres the underlying question of whether mr trump will continue to use mexico as a punching bag perhaps mr trumps position will merely lead to a phony war of words , rather than a real diplomatic or trade conflict but perhaps it will cause major turmoil while bullying and punishing mexico may play to mr trumps base , it would not only cause pain south of the river , but would also bring the united states more problems the call to make mexico pay for the wall is a particularly salient issue not only does the united states command an economy that is 10 times the size of mexicos , but there is a blatant absurdity in extorting another country to pay for your own building the demand , shouted at rallies , seems to seek more to humiliate mexico than to actually secure funding such bravado helped mr trump win the election , but as a real foreign policy goal , it could gain nothing and cause deep antagonism mexico and the united states havent always been at peace they clashed repeatedly in the 19th and early 20th century , mostly to mexicos loss american troops raised their flag in mexico city in the mexican american war , before securing the treaty of guadalupe hidalgo , which gave the united states almost half of mexicos territory in 1914 , american troops returned to bombard and occupy the port of veracruz gen francisco villa , better known to history as pancho villa , stormed over the border into columbus , n m , in 1916 , and in 1938 , mexico expropriated american oil companies in 1969 , president richard m nixon unleashed operation intercept , under which every vehicle crossing the border was searched as a way to pressure mexico to spray poison on marijuana and opium poppy crops in 1985 , corrupt mexican policemen worked with cartel members to kidnap and murder an american agent for the drug enforcement administration , enrique camarena yet these disputes never changed the fundamental nature of the bilateral relationship or stopped trade between the two countries from rising steadily to more than half a trillion dollars last year and during this time , mexico and the united states have coordinated on many actions , from disaster relief \( the mexican navy helped after hurricane katrina \) to sharing river water in 2014 , a record number of unaccompanied children from el salvador , guatemala and honduras arrived on americas southern border , causing what the white house called an urgent humanitarian situation the flow ebbed only when mexico stepped up its own detentions of central americans after human rights groups criticized these mass arrests , mexico has promised to make it easier for the central americans , many who have fled brutal gang violence , to gain asylum however , trying to force mexico to pay for a border wall , or slapping on tariffs that would savage its economy , could fracture this cooperation mexico may be smaller than the united states , but it is still a major economic and political power if mr trump pushes too far , it could hit back with its own tariffs that hurt american exporters it would see no incentive to reduce the flow of migrants and refugees from other countries to the united states and pushing mexico into recession may only make more people here pick up and head north anyway as much as mr trump seems to like abusing mexico and its people , president trump would be wise to try a different
arthur brooks hi , gail so just when we thought that 2016 couldnt get any more shocking , it did , with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the universe , what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned goods \? gail collins greetings from the land of duck and cover , arthur not sure its quite sunk in but yes , freeze dried foods and subterranean real estate are in demand arthur duck and cover sounds like a hunting club so where shall we begin \? gail im a little weary of the why it happened conversations lets get right to it what do you think will happen next \? arthur donald trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog chucho will chase squirrels the world will go on gail glad to hear chuchos taking it well arthur he stayed cautiously neutral in the election , but hes a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps thats a good place to start a conversation about the future ive been amazed , since i came to washington , at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in 2008 , democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable gail hey , i made a point ! things are looking better already arthur both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive fatalism , like the classic threats to leave the country gail reader email has informed me its way harder to leave the country than one might think we americans arent in all that much demand arthur and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is permanent , they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side gail well , looking at a president trump and a republican controlled house and senate , id say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president obama did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to george w bush , who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the iraq invasion but obamacare was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea arthur i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in 2009 , even though they dont have to , it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into obamacare some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in it and sure enough , here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology thats why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to this is spinal tap turn it up to 11 give on a few things where you dont have to , because someday youre going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing administrations horror at seeing some or all of obamacare repealed gail we part company here my perception of obamacare was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican position , just a ton of people who wanted to be deal makers but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that weve left behind the old lets have a drink after work congress weve now got guys who sleep in their offices and dont even talk to the other side at the house gym arthur secretly a lot of them are actually friends , but i take your point and thats another recommendation i would make to president trump make friends everyplace that was the l b j reagan clinton magic dont golf with the same people every week gail since i have no choice , im prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of obamacare is so great that even if hillary clinton had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised something better and as of his 60 minutes interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so well see what he comes up with i know youre a big paul ryan fan his agenda and trumps agenda really dont match , do they \? arthur congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next years , and ryan and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe ryans plan includes a health care replacement plan for obamacare it will actually do some of the things liberals \( and conservatives \) really want , like getting more people covered i realize that its very disappointing for progressives to see obamacare repealed , but its not like it will be replaced by nothing gail this is one area where the product doesnt usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate barack obama saying all health care negotiations could take place in public , on c span grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions im
before obamacare , it could be hard to buy your own insurance if youd already had a health problem like cancer an insurance company might have decided not to sell any insurance to someone like you it might have agreed to cover you , but not cover cancer care or it might have offered you a comprehensive policy , but at some incredibly high price that you could never have paid donald j trump says he wants to do away with much of obamacare , but he has signaled that parts of the law that banned those practices are good policy hed want to keep i like those very much , he told the wall street journal last week about the laws rules that prevent discrimination based on pre existing conditions the pre existing conditions policies are very popular nearly everyone has relatives or friends with illnesses in their past cancer , arthritis , depression , even allergies that could have shut them out of the individual insurance markets before obamacare , so its an issue that hits close to home for many americans but keeping those provisions while jettisoning others is most likely no fix at all those policies that make the insurance market feel fairer for sick americans who need it can really throw off the prices for everyone else thats why obamacare also includes less popular policies designed to balance the market with enough young , healthy people imagine youre that patient with cancer you really want health insurance , and youre probably willing to pay a lot to get it if the law requires insurance companies to offer you a policy , you are very likely to buy it now imagine youre a young , healthy person without any health problems your budget is tight , and health insurance is expensive you might decide youll be fine without insurance , since you can always buy it later , when youre the one with a pessimistic diagnosis before obamacare , several states tried policies like this , and required insurance companies to sell insurance to everyone at the same price , regardless of health histories the results were nearly the same everywhere prices went way up enrollment went way down and insurance companies fled the markets some states hobbled along with small , expensive markets some experienced total market collapse and repealed the policies prices in those markets typically became so high that they were really a good deal only for people who knew theyd use a lot of health care services and the sicker the insurance pool got , the more the companies would charge for their health plans the health law attempts to broaden the pool by offering financial assistance to middle class people by limiting how much people can be asked to pay for insurance , the laws subsidies help make the purchase more attractive for healthier customers thats the laws carrot then theres the stick the law says that if you dont buy insurance , and you could have afforded it , you have to pay a fine that rule is designed to discourage people from gaming the system by waiting until theyre sick the mandate remains the laws least popular provision new york is a great case study before obamacare , it had the pre existing conditions policy , but without subsidies or a mandate when the obamacare rules kicked in , premiums there went down by 50 percent this year , obamacare premiums have risen substantially an average of 22 percent around the country leading many experts and politicians to question whether the laws incentives were strong enough some , including hillary clinton , have argued that the government should sweeten the carrot , by making the subsidies more generous others have said that the stick should sting more by forcing the uninsured to pay a bigger penalty for sitting out of the market republican politicians have tended to criticize both of the incentive provisions the subsidies have been attacked as excessive government spending the mandate has been criticized as an inappropriate use of government power both have been the subject of big supreme court cases challenging the law both would have been eliminated under a bill passed by congress but vetoed by president obama last year taking away those unpopular pieces of the law and keeping the popular pre existing conditions piece might seem like a political win but it would result in a broken system when mitt romney was devising the massachusetts health reform law that would become the model for obamacare , he hoped to set up a marketplace for health plans with some financial assistance for low income people to buy insurance what he didnt want was a mandate then jonathan gruber , an m i t economist who had calculated the results , showed him the numbers his plan would cover only a third of the uninsured and cost two thirds as much as an identical plan with a mandate mr romney embraced the mandate when barack obama ran for president in 2007 , he , too , advocated a market based health reform system he , too , said he did not support a mandate then he became president , and economists brought him the numbers by the time the affordable care act passed , he had changed his mind well see what happens when the economists bring the numbers to mr trump his transition website suggests that he might develop a different solution to the problem a special , separate insurance market just for sick people but that plan is different from the more modest amendments to the affordable care act he described to the wall street journal it wont be easy to keep the basic architecture of obamacare while plucking out its least popular pieces \( another provision that mr trump says he likes , the requirement that insurers cover young adults on their parents policies , would be easier to save \)
washington the f b i reported monday that attacks against american muslims surged last year , driving an overall increase in hate crime against all groups the data , which is the most comprehensive look at hate crime nationwide , expanded on previous findings by researchers and outside monitors , who have noted an alarming rise in some types of crimes tied to the vitriol of this years presidential campaign and the aftermath of terrorist attacks at home and abroad since 2015 that trend appears to have spiked in just the last week , with civil rights groups and news organizations reporting dozens of verbal or physical assaults on minorities and others that appear to have been fueled by divisions over the election in its report on monday , the f b i cataloged a total of 5 , 818 hate crimes in 2015 a rise of about 6 percent over the previous year including assaults , bombings , threats , and property destruction against minorities , women , gays and others attacks against muslim americans saw the biggest surge there were 257 reports of assaults , attacks on mosques and other hate crimes against muslims last year , a jump of about 67 percent over 2014 it was the highest total since 2001 , when more than 480 attacks occurred in the aftermath of the sept 11 attacks attacks against transgender people also sharply increased blacks were the most frequent victims of hate crimes based on race , while jews were the most frequent victims based on religion , according to the f b i data but the increases in attacks on these groups were smaller than the rise in attacks against muslims and transgender people over all , 59 percent of the hate crimes that the f b i recorded were based on the victims race , ethnicity or ancestry religious bias accounted for about 20 percent of all attacks , and about 18 percent of attacks were based on sexual orientation law enforcement officials acknowledge that the statistics give an incomplete picture because many local agencies still have a spotty record of reporting hate crimes , 26 years after congress directed the justice department to begin collecting the data we need to do a better job of tracking and reporting hate crime to fully understand what is happening in our communities and how to stop it , james b comey , the f b i director , said monday the f b i regards the prosecution of hate crimes under federal jurisdiction as the top priority of its civil rights branch since the election , hate crime monitors like the southern poverty law center have reported a rash of verbal or physical abuse targeting minorities and others at schools , mosques and elsewhere some supporters of president elect donald j trump , however , say they too have been victimized
over the last week , two of the worlds biggest internet companies have faced mounting criticism over how fake news on their sites may have influenced the presidential elections outcome on monday , those companies responded by making it clear that they would not tolerate such misinformation by taking pointed aim at fake news sites revenue sources google kicked off the action on monday afternoon when the silicon valley search giant said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service hours later , facebook , the social network , updated the language in its facebook audience network policy , which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content , to include fake news sites we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news , a facebook spokesman said in a statement our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance taken together , the decisions were a clear signal that the tech behemoths could no longer ignore the growing outcry over their power in distributing information to the american electorate facebook has been at the epicenter of that debate , accused by some commentators of swinging some voters in favor of president elect donald j trump through misleading and outright wrong stories that spread quickly via the social network one such false story claimed that pope francis had endorsed mr trump google did not escape the glare , with critics saying the company gave too much prominence to false news stories on sunday , the site mediaite reported that the top result on a google search for final election vote count 2016 was a link to a story on a website called 70news that wrongly stated that mr trump , who won the electoral college , was ahead of his democratic challenger , hillary clinton , in the popular vote by monday evening , the fake story had fallen to no 2 in a search for those terms google says software algorithms that use hundreds of factors determine the ranking of news stories the goal of search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users , andrea faville , a google spokeswoman , said in a statement in this case , we clearly didnt get it right , but we are continually working to improve our algorithms facebooks decision to clarify its ad policy language is notable because mark zuckerberg , the social networks chief executive , has repeatedly fobbed off criticism that the company had an effect on how people voted in a post on his facebook page over the weekend , he said that 99 percent of what people see on the site is authentic , and only a tiny amount is fake news and hoaxes over all , this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other , mr zuckerberg wrote yet within facebook , employees and executives have been increasingly questioning their responsibilities and role in influencing the electorate , the new york times reported on saturday facebooks ad policy update will not stem the flow of fake news stories that spread through the news feeds that people see when they visit the social network facebook has long spoken of how it helped influence and stoke democratic movements in places like the middle east , and it tells its advertisers that it can help sway its users with ads facebook reaches 1 8 billion people around the globe , and the company is one of the largest distributors of news online a pew research center study said that nearly half of american adults rely on facebook as a news source googles decision on monday relates to the google adsense system that independent web publishers use to display advertising on their sites , generating revenue when ads are seen or clicked on the advertisers pay google , and google pays a portion of those proceeds to the publishers more than two million publishers use googles advertising network for some time , google has had policies in place prohibiting misleading advertisements from its system , including promotions for counterfeit goods and weight loss scams googles new policy , which it said would go into effect imminently , will extend its ban on misrepresentative content to the websites its advertisements run on moving forward , we will restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent , misstate or conceal information about the publisher , the publishers content or the primary purpose of the web property , ms faville said ms faville said that the policy change had been in the works for a while and was not in reaction to the election it remains to be seen how effective googles new policy on fake news will be in practice the policy will rely on a combination of automated and human reviews to help determine what is fake although satire sites like the onion are not the target of the policy , it is not clear whether some of them , which often run fake news stories written for humorous effect , will be inadvertently affected by googles change
nbc sports will take over the thursday night football franchise this week at a suddenly promising point in an n f l season that has seen viewership plummet by double digit percentages in prime time games the decline has concerned league and network officials and has prompted questioning over its causes had the contentious presidential election kept viewers away from football , especially when games competed with debates between donald j trump and hillary clinton \? were there too many bad matchups and too few star turns \? were fans fed up with long commercial breaks \? were they ignoring games for online highlights \? n f l commissioner roger goodell suggested last week that the league was considering ways to improve the pace of games , from running fewer advertisements to speeding up video reviews so , sunday was a litmus test if the election had diminished football audiences , then the conclusion of the campaigns might lure fans back the results suggested that a cloud had begun to lift , and that compelling games played by marquee teams would keep fans engaged seattles exciting 31 24 win over new england on sunday night on nbc drew an average of 22 5 million viewers , up 16 percent from the comparable game last season until then , nbcs viewership had fallen by 18 percent this season , to 19 3 million foxs late afternoon broadcast of dallass 35 30 last minute victory over pittsburgh generated a preliminary overnight rating of a 17 8 , the highest for any n f l game this season \( although it fell 3 percent from the comparable game on cbs last year \) but cbss slate of games sunday afternoon tumbled 28 percent from last year nbc takes over the thursday night games starting with new orleans playing carolina , teams with sub 500 records that might not give the network a lift to start its five game schedule but with the election over as well as the baseball postseason that ended with 40 million people watching the chicago cubs clinch the world series in game 7 nbc is hoping to fare better than cbs and nfl network did earlier this season in five games through oct 20 , cbs and nfl networks total viewership of 14 7 million fell 16 percent from a year ago cbs and nbc are paying the league a combined 450 million a year to carry five games apiece that they broadcast and nfl network simulcasts this is nbcs first season on thursday night games cbs had carried eight games a season for two years i think we have very good games , said sam flood , the executive producer of nbc sports and nbcsn but we all know the back half of the season can be a bit of a crapshoot youre not sure whos going to be great and whos not going to be great who would have thought the dallas cowboys would be the best team in football right now , by their record \? minnesota started as the best team in the n f l and has lost a few in a row the cowboys and the vikings will play dec 1 nbcs thursday night schedule is a bit different from cbss , which took a break during week 4 but nbcs goes for six straight weeks because the thanksgiving night game is part of its sunday night package our excitement is to have this run until the end of the season and into holiday shopping , which has a lot of advantages for our ad sales people , flood said monday during a media gathering at a manhattan restaurant the n f l has tried hard over the years to turn thursday night games into an attraction that would bolster nfl network and rival the older sunday and monday night franchises the league has increased the number of thursday night over the years , but it has found its biggest success in selling some of the games , first to cbs , and now to cbs and nbc , because broadcast networks reach larger audiences than a league owned channel like nfl network but thursday night games have been less attractive to players , who dislike the short week of preparation time after sunday , and to fans who see that the mostly divisional matchups dont generally rival those of other prime time packages the thursday broadcasts have also become part of a discussion about whether the n f l is overwhelming fans with too many games rodney harrison , an analyst on nbcs pregame show , said that he was looking less at the election as a factor in shrinking audiences than quality games the problem is you have to go back to earning the right to be on television rather than saying , we have all these slots , on sunday , thursday , sunday and monday the remark was targeted largely at the thursday night package twenty nine teams play at least one game on the thursday night package that is being carried by cbs , nbc and nfl network the other three play on thanksgiving
the election of donald j trump has led to considerable soul searching in the news business , as journalists confront the role we played in his triumph much has been written about the billions of dollars of free media coverage trump received , journalists lapses in challenging his outrageous falsehoods , and our clumsy grappling with how to treat his unconventional candidacy but the news coverage that helped trump the most wasnt about the campaign it began long before it decades before his candidacy , in fact trump was the beneficiary of a belief near universal in american journalism that serious news can essentially be defined as whats going wrong a lot has gone wrong across the country , especially for trumps core supporters , the white working class who have suffered serious economic and social dislocation many feel powerless and resent elites and journalists , whom they find arrogant and condescending trump gave voice to their grievances and placed their personal struggles within a larger narrative of national decline a decline that , he said , was so sharp and frightening that revolutionary change was needed , and only he knew how to deliver it to make his case , trump recounted a near daily vision of a government hopelessly broken and corrupt , cities that had become hellholes , military leaders who resembled the keystone kops , immigrants flooding into the country stealing jobs when theyre not raping and killing in americas inner cities , he said , you saw poverty rejection horrible education no housing , no homes , no ownership crime at levels that nobody has seen crime is , in fact , at unusual levels , but its unusually low levels close to the lowest rate in 45 years immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than their native born peers and twice as likely to start businesses in many parts of the country , the public institutions that people count on every day like schools and hospitals have improved , thanks to a wide range of reforms and initiatives in the past few years , there have also been steady gains in employment and wages , although work is less predictable than in the past and many americans remain insecure and discouraged the state of the union is mixed so why did so many people accept trumps dark vision \? one answer is that it fits with what they feel from the news in this case , it doesnt matter if its left or right wing news where can you count on finding stories every day about violence , social dysfunction and government incompetence and scandal \? when is the last time you read a news story about government competence \? what are the images from the news that readily come to mind about african americans , latinos , muslims or immigrants \? do you picture people with aspirations who are studying , making contributions , building businesses \? or do you picture lawlessness , drug use , dysfunction \? for decades , journalisms steady focus on problems and seemingly incurable pathologies was preparing the soil that allowed trumps seeds of discontent and despair to take root today , this problem is magnified by the fragmentation of news sources and a proliferation of fake news one consequence is that many americans today have difficulty imagining , valuing or even believing in the promise of incremental system change , which leads to a greater appetite for revolutionary , smash the machine change , as we have seen in this election a survey from the pew research center published last week found that 53 percent of trump supporters , but only 16 percent of clinton supporters , felt it was more effective to try new approaches that may solve problems quickly , but also risk making things worse the erosion of belief has been gradual it didnt begin with the internet or cable tv , and it is not entirely because of the new enthusiasm for getting news from social media or late night comedians it can , ironically , be traced instead to the years of the vietnam war , watergate , c i a surveillance of americans and other profoundly disillusioning experiences in the 1960s and 1970s , when reporters were doing what the originators of the first amendment had in mind checking the power of public officials by holding them accountable that was a public service , and it ended a more permissive era when a more timid brand of journalism glorified leaders , knowingly looking away from their personal and professional lapses unfortunately , the pendulum swing led to a new problem hypercynicism , with virtually everything about americas leaders , power brokers and civic actors , including their private lives , fair game for scrutiny speaking truth to power now meant taking down all icons , exposing all pretension and looking for self interest and spin everywhere the effect on the social fabric has been corrosive since the early 1970s , surveys conducted annually have revealed that trust and confidence in virtually all american institutions government , corporations , banks , medicine , education , organized religion and , yes , the press have been declining steadily even worse , over the past four and a half decades , americans have become significantly less trusting of one another as well from 1972 to 2012 , the percentage of respondents to the general social survey who said that most people can be trusted dropped to 32 percent from 46 percent in parts of the midwest , the drop was particularly dramatic from about 60 percent to the mid 30s disillusionment and cynicism have become natural byproducts of everyday journalism were not talking about politically tainted news , or the if it bleeds , it leads reflexes of local tv coverage , which provide nightly reinforcement of the threat of violence from strangers even as that threat is negligible for the vast majority
of all the climate policies the trump administration has promised to undo , auto emissions standards could be the most consequential americas 250 million cars , together with other modes of transport , now emit more carbon dioxide than any other segment of the united states more than its power stations , factories or households the sheer volume of auto emissions has made the fuel efficiency goals introduced by president obama , intended to reduce auto pollution and drive up gas mileage , one of the single biggest steps any nation has taken to fight global warming those targets are now likely to be scaled back or even scrapped aides to mr trump , who campaigned on promises to revive the fossil fuel industry , roll back environmental regulations and cancel the paris climate deal , signaled over the weekend that he would look for a quick exit from americas commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions a trump senior adviser , john mashburn , better known for his advocacy of anti abortion issues , told the wall street journal that the administration intended to begin a comprehensive rethinking of all federal regulations including a review of the fuel economy and emissions standards to make sure they are not harming consumers or american workers the trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment automakers are seizing on the change in administration to argue for re evaluating fuel economy and emissions rules , which are set to become progressively more stringent starting with 2017 model cars in a letter dated nov 10 to the trump transition team , the alliance of automobile manufacturers , which represents a dozen of the biggest car and light truck makers , urged a reassessment of emissions rules that the group said posed a substantial challenge for the auto industry those rules are designed to deliver a new car fleet averaging 54 5 miles per gallon in 2025 , compared with about 36 miles per gallon now the obama administration already has a review of that target underway as car prices rise , it becomes vital to look at the full cost of regulatory initiatives , the industry groups chief executive , mitch bainwol , said in the letter climate protection advocates are nervous automakers are asking him to let them guzzle oil and pollute more and increase our oil addiction , daniel f becker , director of the safe climate campaign said , referring to mr trump are they going to go back to making early 20th century vehicles \? the possible easing of federal emissions rules throws a wrench in good news from scientists at the global carbon project , an international science policy advisory group , which projected on monday that global carbon dioxide emissions would grow by just 0 2 percent this year compared with levels in 2015 , the third consecutive year emissions stayed relatively flat the scientists , who measure both emissions from human activity and absorption by oceans and plants , attributed the flat growth to lower emissions , especially from coal , by the worlds largest emitters , china and the united states those two countries together make up 44 percent of the worlds carbon dioxide emissions the environmental protection agency had estimated that based on current fuel efficiency targets , lifetime carbon dioxide emission reductions for all vehicles sold from 2017 to 2025 would total nearly two gigatons and save american consumers billions of gallons of fuel but climate change forecasts remain grim the world meteorological organization said monday that preliminary data through september showed 2016 on course to be the hottest year on record , beating record breaking temperatures in 2015 despite growing climate concerns , american automakers have struggled to make significant gains in overall fuel efficiency in recent years , as they increase the production of gas guzzling light trucks , minivans and sport utility vehicles , which are subject to less stringent emissions standards , and better for companies bottom lines \( the automakers say that it is consumers , not automakers , who are driving this switch toward larger cars \) and in the united states , automakers enjoy generous incentives for selling hybrid or electric vehicles for each green car sold , automakers earn credits that then allow them to meet less stringent fuel efficiency targets for their entire fleet as currently practiced , those credits can have unintended consequences in a startling study published in february , researchers at carnegie mellon found that those incentives meant that each time an electric vehicle or other green car was sold in place of a conventional vehicle , fleet carbon dioxide emissions increased by as much as 60 tons and gasoline consumption increased by as much as 7 , 000 gallons a year the e p a has said it thinks this trade off is worthwhile , because green car sales could lay the foundation for a bigger switch to electric vehicles but a relaxing of fuel emissions standards could derail that assumption jeremy michalek , a professor in the department of engineering and public policy at carnegie mellon , said that putting a price on carbon in the form of a carbon tax would be a simpler and more effective way to pursue fuel efficiency in the nations vehicles the idea of a carbon tax has been a contentious one in american politics last week , voters rejected a ballot proposal in washington state that would have imposed a tax on greenhouse gas emissions , starting at 15 per metric ton \( a typical passenger car emits about five metric tons of carbon dioxide a year \) but mr michalek remains a proponent of carbon taxes carbon pricing is giving people freedom , he said , adding that might be a virtue mr trump would appreciate i could buy a fuel efficient car , or a smaller car i could still get the car i want , and drive it

moscow president vladimir v putin of russia and president elect donald j trump spoke by telephone for the first time on monday , agreeing to review what both consider the poor state of relations between the two countries , according to a statement from the kremlin the two agreed on the absolutely unsatisfactory state of bilateral relations , said the statement , and they both endorsed the idea of undertaking joint efforts to normalize relations and pursue constructive cooperation on the broadest possible range of issues the issues discussed included trade and economic ties as well as combating terrorism mr putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate mr trump last wednesday , sending him a telegram about an hour after he had emerged the victor , but the two men have not met nor had they spoken previously mr putin repeated the congratulations over the phone the russian president said he hoped that moscow could build a collaborative dialogue with washington on the bases of equality , mutual respect and noninterference in the others internal affairs , the release said the two men also discussed syria in the context of the need to work together in the struggle against the no 1 common enemy international terrorism and extremism , the statement said although mr putin maintained studied neutrality during the presidential race , the state run news media , which answers to him , clearly pulled for mr trump among other issues , mr putin blames hillary clinton , then secretary of state , for the mass demonstrations that greeted his return to the presidency in 2012 after mrs clinton lost , the flagship state television news broadcast took to referring to her as the blonde woman during the campaign , senior united states security officials accused russia of hacking the computers at the democratic national committee headquarters and releasing emails that proved embarrassing to the clinton campaign mr putin denied any state role in the hacking the russian government was one of the few around the world that was openly gleeful about the american election result , with members of the state duma , the lower house of the russian legislature , breaking into applause at the announcement the united russia party , loyal to mr putin , dominates the duma mr trump and mr putin developed something of a mutual admiration society during the election , particularly after mr trump suggested that crimea , which moscow annexed from ukraine , should belong to russia and that the united states should ally itself with russia and the syrian government of president bashar al assad to fight the islamic state mr trump also suggested the united states might dilute its support for nato , which russia considers a main threat much of the brief statement from the kremlin about the telephone call echoed previous statements that mr putin had made about his goals for relations with washington , including a return to pragmatic , mutually beneficial cooperation mr putin openly endorses the idea that the world should return to the era when two superpowers assumed a general responsibility for global stability and security some analysts , however , have suggested that mr trump is unpredictable and the traditional republican penchant for painting russia as a dire threat could still emerge the putin administration is hoping that the west will lift sanctions imposed over the crisis in ukraine on the phone call , which the kremlin said was arranged by mutual consent , the two men agreed to stay in contact and to meet at an unspecified date in the future earlier , mr trump described the note on his victory that he received from mr putin as beautiful for its part , russia has continued its glowing tributes to mr trump as a paragon who triumphed in what is repeatedly depicted in the russian media as the swamp of american politics the main weekly news program on state television every sunday night tends to focus mainly on the united states , with dmitry kiselyov , the anchor , suggesting this week that europe follow the american lead in replacing its leaders under president trump , mr kiselyov said , the american government would finally drop what the russian anchor called its annoying slogans about human rights and democracy russia has a lot of trust in trump , he said
the appointment of stephen k bannon as chief white house strategist for president elect donald j trump has been condemned by civil rights groups , democrats and some republicans , because of mr bannons record as chairman of breitbart news , the hard right news and opinion site here , in his own words , are a selection of mr bannons public statements about the country , the republican party and his own political philosophy fear is a good thing fear is going to lead you to take action , he said in a 2010 interview referring to ann coulter , michele bachmann and sarah palin in a 2011 radio interview on political vindication radio , he said these women cut to the heart of the progressive narrative thats why there are some unintended consequences of the womens liberation movement that , in fact , the women that would lead this country would be pro family , they would have husbands , they would love their children they wouldnt be a bunch of dykes that came from the seven sisters schools up in new england that drives the left insane , and thats why they hate these women mr bannon made a movie in 2012 about the occupy wall street protests he told an interviewer after making the occupy movie , when you finish watching the film , you want to take a hot shower you want to go home and shower because youve just spent an hour and 15 minutes with the greasiest , dirtiest people you will ever see i think anger is a good thing , he told a gathering of conservatives in washington in 2013 , according to a profile in the atlantic this country is in a crisis and if youre fighting to save this country , if youre fighting to take this country back , its not going to be sunshine and patriots its going to be people who want to fight im a leninist , mr bannon was quoted as saying by a writer for the daily beast who met him at a party in 2014 he later said he did not recall the conversation lenin wanted to destroy the state , and thats my goal , too , the site quoted him as saying i want to bring everything crashing down , and destroy all of todays establishment what we need to do is bitch slap the republican party , he said in a 2010 radio interview on political vindication radio we dont believe there is a functional conservative party in this country , and we certainly dont think the republican party is that , he told the same gathering its going to be an insurgent , center right populist movement that is virulently anti establishment , and its going to continue to hammer this city , both the progressive left and the institutional republican party there is a

moscow a russian fighter jet crashed off the syrian coast on monday while trying to land on an aging aircraft carrier in the mediterranean , russian military officials said the russian defense ministry blamed a technical failure for the crash of the jet , a mig 29 , according to a ministry statement carried by the interfax news agency the pilot , who was the only one in the jet , ejected safely and was picked up by a rescue team , the statement said the ministrys statement did not specify whether the airplane had crashed on the carrier , the admiral kuznetsov , or into water in a separate statement , the ministry said that rebels in aleppo had used chemical weapons in an attack on the syrian army , poisoning around 30 of its servicemen russia stationed the admiral kuznetsov , its only aircraft carrier , off the syrian coast last week in what analysts said was the latest attempt by the kremlin to demonstrate its growing might designed in the soviet era , the warship has had a history of problems because its technology is obsolete , analysts say , planes are forced to take off without a full load of fuel and weapons the ministry said operations from the carrier had not been suspended the kuznetsov has more than a dozen jets on board that can carry out operations around syria , including over aleppo , where russia has been helping the government of president bashar al assad withstand islamic militants and opposition forces on monday , president vladimir v putin of russia and the united states president elect , donald j trump , discussed syria in their first telephone conversation they agreed to work together in the struggle against their no 1 common enemy international terrorism and extremism , according to a statement published by the kremlin in that context , they discussed issues related to solving the crisis in syria the chemical attack occurred in eastern aleppo on sunday evening , and most of the affected soldiers have been hospitalized , a spokesman for the ministry , maj gen igor konashenkov , said in a statement russian specialists took samples on site , which confirmed the presence of poisonous chlorine gas , he said terrorists in aleppo are using chlorine against the syrian army and civilians more and more often , general konashenkov said however , the politicians in france and especially britain , who publicly say they worry about aleppo , do not see these obvious crimes russia made similar allegations on friday , saying white phosphorus and artillery shells with chlorine gas had been found at a site in aleppo from which rebels had retreated the allegations were rejected by the syrian national coalition , an exile opposition group rebel factions , operating in eastern aleppo have repeatedly said they do not use toxic gas the attack occurred as government and rebel forces traded artillery fire sunday on the eastern edge of the rebel held half of aleppo russia has repeatedly accused rebels of using chemical weapons , while vehemently denying allegations that the syrian army uses them an investigation led by the united nations concluded in october that syrian forces had used chlorine bombs at least three times from april 2014 to march 2015 the inquiry also found that the islamic state had used sulfur mustard in august 2015 the russian ambassador to the united nations , vitaly i churkin , said that the investigations findings were unconvincing and that mr assads government should itself investigate whether it had used chemical weapons on friday , the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons , the international chemical weapons watchdog , adopted a statement that said , every actor involved in these chemical weapons attacks should be held responsible
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

hillier repeated incredulously we are not the retirement place of choice , wormald explained pensioners thats one export success we dont often hear the government boasting about fridayas with much of my life , inertia invariably wins the day on black friday , so im yet again left with the feeling ive probably missed out on dozens of bargains i never get round to starting my christmas shopping until the second week in december and i dont want a new tv quite enough to go through the hassle of trying to work out which is the right one even if i did , im fairly sure id end up buying a product that was being discontinued or was actually cheaper in john lewis our own family motto is never knowingly underbought as we always tend to end up paying top dollar for everything , even when were trying to do something on the cheap an example of this was when we went on holiday to egypt some years back and my wife and son mistakenly managed to haggle the price of a souvenir up from the sellers original asking price if only we could see ourselves coming as well as everyone else seems to silver lining of the week we could be even more broke the obr forecast for the countrys finances was more upbeat than many expected
the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do

veteran actor tom hanks has likened clint eastwoods directorial style to wrangling animals hanks worked with eastwood for the first time on sully , the story of a real life feat of heroism in which his character , chesley sully sullenberger , safely landed an endangered plane new yorks hudson river in 2009 hanks told the the graham norton show you certainly dont want one of those eastwood looks hell of a film maker the directors who make clint eastwood look soft read morehe treats his actors like horses because when he did the 60s series rawhide , the director would shout action ! and all the horses bolted so when hes in charge , he says in a really quiet soft voice , all right , go ahead , and instead of shouting cut ! he says thats enough of that its intimidating as hell ! hanks also said that the real sullenberger made for a strong presence on set , even criticising eastwood for his lack of punctuality when he was 20 minutes late sully was very particular about how we portrayed the procedure and the emotions , said hanks he pulled out this dog eared , stapled and notated script that he had read postits , stapled index cards all over it im sure his wife had even written no across it in lipstick ! we went through every page and every moment , every beat had been commented on he had opinions hanks and eastwood campaigned for different sides during the recent us presidential campaign the actor who was even mooted by documentary maker michael moore as a future democrat candidate was a vocal supporter of hillary clinton , frequently speaking of his lack of faith in her rival , donald trump , whom he described as a self involved gas bag eastwood , meanwhile , came out for trump in august , saying the republican was on to something , because secretly everybodys getting tired of political correctness thats the kiss ass generation were in right now , he said were really in a pussy generation eastwood also said he thought a lot of the backlash to trump was misplaced we see people accusing people of being racist and all kinds of stuff when i grew up , those things werent called racist everybody , the press and everybodys going , oh , well , thats racist and theyre making a big hoodoo out of it just fucking get over it its a sad time in history following trumps election earlier this month , hanks sought to reassure his fellow clinton supporters about the future we are going to be all right , he told an audience in new york we will move forward , because if we do not move forward , what is to be said about us \? the graham norton show is broadcast on 25 november at 10 35pm
in two days , jill stein raised more than enough money , more than 5m , to file for recounts in wisconsin , michigan and pennsylvania , though her campaign is still seeking about 2m more to cover the associated legal fees jill stein to formally file for wisconsin recount as fundraising effort passes 5m read moreresults in these battleground states were narrow , with trump winning by just 0 3 in michigan , 1 2 in pennsylvania , and 0 7 in wisconsin if clinton had won all of these states 46 electoral college votes , it have would been enough for her to win the presidency but the recount process is intensive , expensive and unlikely to change the outcome of the election unless widespread voter fraud is proven experts have been skeptical that is the case in wisconsin where her team was due to file a recount motion by friday afternoon election officials would have to examine millions of paper ballots and the paper trails of the 5 of votes cast on electronic touch screen machines wisconsin election commission director michael haas told local news that the commission was preparing for a recount , though it had not seen evidence of interference in the states voting system we dont have any reason to suspect that any voting equipment has been tampered with , haas said unofficial results showed trump won wisconsin by more than 27 , 000 votes the state has never conducted a presidential recount , but steins campaign said it would file a motion for a recount on friday before the deadline to do so in the state facebook twitter pinterest jill stein calls for recount in order to verify us election resultin pennsylvania , there is no paper trail a problem election observers anticipated ahead of the 8 november race the nightmare scenario would be if pennsylvania decides the election and it is very close you would have no paper records to do a recount , lawrence norden , the co author of a report on voting machines , told the los angeles times in late october but because machines there are not connected to the internet , like those in michigan , officials said they couldnt be hacked across the whole of the us , about three quarters of voters mark paper ballots that are counted electronically by an optical scanner , according to the nonpartisan group verified voting , which examines how new technology affects voting integrity but some states , including pennsylvania , rely almost entirely on touchscreen computer voting that does not produce a paper trail the punch card ballots that resulted in the disputed hanging chads during the florida recount in 2000 are no longer used trump was declared the winner in michigan on thursday by 10 , 704 votes , and the election director there insists there was no evidence of hacking its just conjecture , and i dont think that serves anyones good purpose , said chris thomas , the longtime director of michigans bureau of elections
the most interesting question about 2016 is not why the brexit result and trump happened , but whether historians will regard both as incidental whether this will go down as the year democracy revealed itself unworkable in the age of the internet in which reality , already engaged in a life or death struggle with inverted commas , finally gave way to alt reality the results of these votes were shocking , but not surprising the rules of capitalism have been gamed by the ruling kleptocracy and a lot of working people are angry no mystery there in the past week , however , the collective postmortem on the left and right of politics has focused on a concern with far greater long term impact the accidental or deliberate propagation of misinformation via social media many millions of people saw and believed fake reports that the pope had endorsed trump democrats had paid and bussed anti trump protesters hillary clinton was under criminal investigation for sexually assaulting a minor about the only accusation not levelled at clinton was implication in the murder of jfk , and that was because trump had already used it against his republican primary rival ted cruz if democracy is predicated on reliable information , its in serious trouble rightnow facebooks failure did fake news and polarized politics get trump elected \?

mondayif time seemed to drag during theresa mays im not going to tell you that i dont know what im doing brexit speech at the annual conference of confederation of british industry , it almost stopped in the contributions that followed quite what any of those who had paid a lot of money to attend the day long bash at londons grosvenor house hotel gained from hearing the chief exec of deloitte going out of his way to say nothing about how a company memo calling the governments brexit planning a complete shambles ended up as front page news , or the head of facebook in europe saying how much she welcomed disruption while giving the most awkwardly choreographed presentation , is anyones guess but they did all eat very well for breakfast we were offered croissants and pastries , and for elevenses we got ham hock quiche and chocolate muffins for lunch there was a choice of five main courses , including thai prawns and vegetable curry , followed by three desserts for tea , we had doughnuts and clementines if it hadnt been for the entertainment , it would have been a good day out tuesdayi kind of expect post truth antics with brexit , donald trump and nigel farage it goes with the territory but i didnt expect tottenham hotspur , the football club i support , to be quite so fashionably on trend spurs have spent the last six years trying to qualify for the champions league a second time , and now that theyve done so , what do they do \? they decide to rest some key players for a game which they have to win to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stages of the competition the reason \? they wanted to keep some players fresh for this saturdays premier league fixture against chelsea brilliant you spend years trying to qualify for a competition , only not to compete properly in it so that you stand a better chance of qualifying for it again the following season its meta , post truth football in which its not the taking part that counts , but the qualification to take part predictably , spurs came unstuck , which at least gave some of their older fans a sense of familiarity its a club tradition that spurs fail so that we dont have to wednesdaywhen i was at exeter university in the 1970s , male students with long hair tended to stick together the hair was considered to be a cultural signifier that you werent a member of the conservative association and that you probably shared some alternative lifestyle choices thank god , then , i wasnt at oxford with philip lurch hammond , the dullest man in westminster , or i could have come badly unstuck old photos of the chancellor have just been published showing him to have been a bit of a hippy with hair down to his shoulders imagine the possible faux pas there you are sitting in some unheated squat giving the bloke the benefit of the doubt for droning on about free market capitalism , because you assume he must have been up all night listening to gong then it turns out he isnt stoned , he means every word of what hes saying and that he really is that boring thursdayjust occasionally , select committee proceedings give you an insight into how the rest of the world sees us during a recent session of the public accounts committee at which the department of health civil servant chris wormald made headlines for saying the nhs was planning on making patients show theirs passports to access treatment one gem slipped under the radar during a question about reciprocal healthcare arrangements for foreign pensioners , the chair , meg hillier , asked wormald if he had any comparative figures for spain yes , he said promptly at our last count there are 62 spanish not 62 , 000 \?

the scottish and welsh first ministers have clashed over the idea of a separate brexit deal for scotland as leaders from across the uk met at a summit of the british irish council nicola sturgeon made it clear at the summit in south wales that she wanted scotland to continue to be part of the single market even if the rest of the uk leaves it but carwyn jones , the welsh first minister , argued that such a move could not work and would lead to border posts being set up between england and scotland jones , sturgeon and northern irelands deputy first minister , martin mcguinness , were united in the view that theresa may ought to have attended the summit the first held since she became prime minister during an extra summit called in the summer in the wake of the eu referendum , the leaders of the devolved nations said they would work together to make sure they were not done over by westminster during the brexit negotiations boris johnson is a clown who has united the eu against britain jean quatremer read morebut on friday , at the first regular summit since the referendum , differences in approach were exposed speaking at a press conference after the summit , sturgeon said the prospect of a hard brexit with the uk leaving the single market was a real possibility she said we are looking at how could we best protect our own interest , protect our place in the single market , even if the uk decides to leave of course that would be challenging , there would be a number of practical barriers that we would have to overcome and the work we are doing right now is to explore how those barriers could be overcome speaking on bbc radio scotland , jones said i cant see how it would work he said separate market access arrangements for scotland would mean customs posts at the border there is no other way to deal with that , he said jones said the election of donald trump made it even more crucial that the uk continued to have free access to european markets he said this is a changing world and these are tumultuous times but our focus on retaining full and unfettered access to the single market is unwavering the irish prime minister , enda kenny , told the summit the government in dublin had no intention of pressing britain for a border poll that would determine the constitutional position of northern ireland kenny said there was enough on our plates with brexit without demands for a plebiscite on irish unity in northern ireland , 56 of people voted to remain within the european union in the referendum and nationalist politicians , including mcguinness , said there should be a border poll on the regions continued existence within the uk however , successive opinion polls including one taken after the brexit vote show a majority within northern ireland still prefer to remain within the uk in his speech at the summit kenny compared the northern ireland economy to the state dominated former east germany , given the provinces heavy reliance on subsidies from the uk treasury his reference to east germany raises the enormous costs dublin would have to take on to absorb northern ireland into a new unitary state kenny also made it clear that he believed brexit would take longer than two years he told sky news that leaving the eu would throw up more detailed and unforeseen issues than people might have imagined i would expect to see the divorce , as it is called , take place but that there be a transition period and then a new relationship founded between the uk and the european union i think it will be impossible to do all of the negotiations inside the contemplated two year period , he said thats why i think there is a growing feeling in europe that there should be a transition period and that might well be longer than those two years i think it will be kenny also held a bilateral meeting with sturgeon before her trip to dublin on monday , during which she will become the first serving head of government to address the seanad , the upper house of the irish parliament sturgeon said scotland and ireland shared history and a long tradition of co operation on a range of issues she added in the post brexit landscape , it has become even more important that we work together to protect our shared interests although the prime minister did not attend the summit , four uk government ministers were present one of them , the northern ireland secretary , james brokenshire , said the prime minister strongly supports the british irish council thats why you had two cabinet ministers and two other ministers here today strongly representing the uk governments perspective

a lot has been said in the fortnight following the election of donald trump , as journalists and readers search for some certainty and reassurance at a time when there seem few definite answers so much noise makes it difficult to draw any conclusions which means morning conference at the guardian remains an important space for rational discussion every day , at 10am , journalists and staff from across the company gather the editor in chief reflects on what we published yesterday , and section editors lay out the direction of our coverage for the next 24 hours in news , opinion , sport , culture , video , community , visuals and beyond most people turn up to listen to or participate in the conversation that takes place when the questions of the day are opened to the floor after trumps election , conference has been very busy the morning of his victory , conference had to be moved to the biggest room in the guardians offices to accommodate the staff from all departments who wanted to attend in my time at the guardian as a video journalist , the only other time conference has been moved like this was following the brexit referendum result both times , it was standing room only and in the wake of trumps election , we were also joined via skype by colleagues in new york , yet to go to bed , including guardian us editor lee glendinning , who talked us through the result as they had witnessed it it has continued to dominate discussion the following monday , conversation focused on the fundamentals of news and reporting in the digital age fake news is a real cause for concern on social media , particularly on facebook , where unverified information and outright lies can swallow up facts and truth thats a frightening concept when 62 of american adults access news through social media questions were raised about whether the guardian should or even could be doing more to debunk myths circling online and call out fake news could the guardian dedicate resources to tackle this kind of story on a daily basis , wondered one journalist another thought that this would be a never ending battle , and our focus should remain on reporting news in the most transparent , truthful way on our own platform since the election , a wide range of news organisations including the guardian have seen an increase in members , subscriptions and donations , suggesting there is still strong demand for balanced analysis from trusted publications although morning conference is open to all , some contributions hold a special weight when gary younge returned from the us , where he had been reporting on the election from indiana , many were eager to hear what he had to say i was particularly struck by his observations about how black communities and white communities organised themselves he noted that while black churches had remained a strong focal point around which people collected and found spaces and support , white communities were now less likely to engage in the same way with the institutions , such as unions or political parties , around which they had traditionally gathered gary elaborated on the key issues such as falling living standards , growing frustrations at globalisation and the decline of skilled union jobs in the region raised in his long read article , published the same day while answering questions , he also cautioned those trying to predict the direction of the winds in the coming months from the french presidential election to the shape of the trump administration it would be unwise to claim to have any of the answers , as this presidential election , and to a larger extent many of the biggest stories of 2016 , have shown this week , i was in the guardian offices in new york for morning conference i could sense a feeling of tension and exhaustion similar to that which ive noticed listening to american friends describing the election over lunch , or overhearing conversations on the bus through queens morning conference in new york is different from our meeting in the uk with a smaller staff in the us , it is more intimate and conversational , which meant it could look quite deeply at which policies trump might enforce and which he might let go getting that us perspective and hearing firsthand the views of guardian journalists on the ground was really eye opening questions about the potential impact of a trump administration on nasa , science and global warming all require rigorous pursuit there seemed to be so much that could have been discussed further , but the discussion is unlikely to fade away any time soon trumps election touches upon practically every key international story of the day , from brexit and syria to the far right and the immigration crisis what will four years with trump as president mean for these issues \? its unsurprising that people are worried it felt as though many americans were waiting for thanksgiving this week in order to pause and take a breath before christmas goes hurtling by , bringing january and trumps inauguration with it but it is more important than ever to keep a critical eye on the details , to push through the misleading stories and report truthful , honest and trustworthy information if theres one thing ive taken from conference this fortnight , its that this is exactly what the guardian intends to do
