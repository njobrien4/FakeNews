in the run up to the presidential election , new york city was hardly trump territory and every time michael ricatto put another display of trump campaign signs up on the lawn of his sizable white house on abingdon road in kew gardens , queens , last summer , they were stolen or knocked down , actions that would later set off a series of events as unpredictable as the election itself infuriated by the thefts , as well as an obscenity about donald j trump that had been spray painted on the public mailbox in front of his house , mr ricatto installed a security camera it captured a grainy image of a sign stealer mr ricatto , 59 and a real estate investor , then printed fliers bearing the image and a 5 , 000 reward offer for information leading to the arrest of the sign thief he hired some local teenagers to post the signs around the neighborhood with tape when the tape ran out , he said , the teenagers used a stapler to post the fliers to trees on the streets the hubbub made the news , and the stapling method was mentioned in the weeks that followed , a team of enforcement officers from the parks department arrived at mr ricattos house , he said , and issued him 22 summonses with fines totaling 1 , 500 and citing unauthorized posting and minor tree damage to 11 trees to mr ricatto , his real transgression was supporting mr trump , a republican , which he claims annoyed democratic city officials lets call it staple gate , said mr ricatto , who calls himself a conservative , a proud gun owner and a fan of ronald reagan and john wayne a supporter of mr trumps democratic opponent , hillary clinton , would never have been cited in this situation , he fumed , and said that official parks department signs are often affixed to trees with similar staples people in new york city dont like conservatives , he said they wanted to teach me a lesson about being outspoken , and about who i believe in so they found something to hang their hat on mr ricatto said he paid the summonses because i didnt want the headache of fighting them , nor the expense of hiring a lawyer instead of backing down , he splurged on a larger trump banner to hang in front of his house , and he called the prominent civil rights lawyer ron kuby to see if he had any grounds to sue the city for damages claiming political bias in an interview , mr kuby said that he thought the summons was a wild overreaction by the city , but that a suit by mr ricatto claiming selective enforcement based on his trump leanings would be difficult case to make a parks department spokesman dismissed the claim that the summonses were political and called them a routine penalty for damage to the trees the fine had nothing to do with the content of the signs mr ricatto posted and everything to do with the fact that staples can damage and even kill trees , the spokesman , sam biederman , said in a statement he added that the fine was determined by the citys administrative court and not based on the amount of damage or the cost associated , but rather on the rule broken the order to cite mr ricatto set off something of a parallel episode within the parks department an enforcement supervisor ordered a sergeant to write the 22 tickets but the sergeant , joe oro , 54 , refused , arguing that it was improper to write summonses weeks after the signs had been removed , with no witnesses to the violations they were bogus summonses , said sergeant oro , a veteran with 29 years on the job i might as well hit every dog owner who puts up a lost puppy sign he said he also consulted a superior officer , and he told me , stay out of it its too political a rookie officer wound up writing the summons , said sergeant oro , who has had previous run ins with the agency as an outspoken member of his union , local 983 of dc 37 the locals president , joe puleo , characterized department officials as using the officers as pawns for their political favoritism in this case sergeant oro said he was included in an email conversation about possibly forcing mr ricatto to pay 41 , 000 in damage for the staple holes , a proposition that an agency lawyer replied to incredulously , in the email chain as for mr ricatto , president elect trumps victory is a bit of revenge last week , he bought and hung a new , larger banner i told you so , the banner reads trump trump trump trump
an email i received from a reader some time ago has begun to haunt me the readers sister was dying of cancer how , she asked me , would i respond to the word grace in the context of a cancer death \? my correspondent did not gloss over the miseries of her sisters terminal state she outlined a series of horrific tests that led doctors to withhold food she described fevers , infections and the weeping legs caused by edema but then she testified to her sisters uncanny ability to brighten any room with her smiles had i received this query while i was undergoing my first treatments , it would have triggered irritation bordering on apoplexy why should a cancer patient be expected to lift her own spirits or anyone elses \? isnt it hard enough dealing with such dire circumstances without having to become a booster for oneself and for caregivers \? one scholar of american cancer culture , samantha king , decries a tyranny of cheerfulness that gets too many patients down , making us feel guilty about expressing understandable anguish during the intervening years , however , i have interacted with friends as they confronted an irreversible condition and i , too , have witnessed a kind of grace that i found inspiring while coping with cancer , these people contested it and sometimes the medical protocols upon which they had to rely yet when bodily functions shut down , few of them dug in and battled a condition pronounced terminal indeed , their sense of tranquillity seemed to be founded on acceptance of their impending mortality what might have contributed to their patent and patient grace \? and given my own impatience with circumstances beyond my control , could i possibly tap such sources \? catholic and protestant authorities agree on the mysterious nature of grace , which they see as a free and undeserved or gratuitous favor , not a reward a disposition that works to perfect the soul , grace cannot be known or acquired through words , beliefs or deeds in the jewish tradition , the hebrew word chen for grace appears in the benediction may the lord be gracious to you , though the word baruch for blessed is used more frequently to denote an unmerited gift for believers who seek this benefit from god , as for nonbelievers who seek it elsewhere , grace remains a highly elusive but highly desirable state , especially in troubled times people with cancer explore all the activities that people without cancer use to make themselves receptive to a sense of beneficence or loving kindness religious liturgies , private prayer , meditation , breathing and body exercises , verse or mantra recitations , making or looking at pictures , listening to or making music , walking in nature , communing with friends , and \( yes \) alcohol or marijuana those engaged daily in one or more of these practices testify to their efficacy a zillion self help books offer instructions \( on some of them \) , but the trick must consist in finding ones own eccentric way my correspondent had glimpsed grace in her sisters smiles shed also found it in an obituary that a massachusetts mother , beth orourke , had composed for herself while she was dying of cancer , and she included a link to it the self obituarys eerie opening i died thursday , april 16 , 2015 prefaces a description of ms orourkes life and then her conclusion that in the end grace and love win , not cancer it reminded me of the first self obituary i had read after a recurrence of endometrial cancer , the seattle based author and editor jane catherine lotter posted an essay in which she recalled the high points of her education and career because she wanted to be joyful about having a full life , rather than sad about having to die she closed with thanks for her family and ended with beautiful day , happy to have been here might the introspection and retrospection of writing serve as one source of grace that transforms it from a gift received to a gift conferred \? after my friend pep died of metastatic colon cancer , his self obit in the local paper brought tears to my eyes it was as if i heard his jokey , self deprecating voice from beyond the grave the act of composition must have composed him , providing an opportunity to reflect on his life , to express appreciation of his family and friends , and to make peace with the posthumous presence he would become in common parlance , the word grace means elegance , ease of comportment , a style that charms those who observe it a scholar of many languages , pep would have known that it derives from the latin gratus , which mean pleasing or thankful , and that it gave rise to the italian grazie and the spanish gracias by virtue of his gracious words , pep bestowed a gift of grace on his family and friends i cannot imagine attaining a durable state of grace throughout the ordeals that will surely arrive in the future instead , i consider practicing a series of hesitant , brief grace notes the musical notation of these short notes is printed in smaller type to indicate an ornament and with a slur mark linking them to the note they precede a fleeting sound before a longer lasting duration that immediately follows to me , they look buoyant , like a tiny bounce or skip forward there must be as many ways to play grace notes as there are people in the world what might they be , i wonder \? in this season , i give thanks for the time that remains to resist animosity and fear , i want to devote it to becoming proficient at all sorts of grace notes before the chords of closure resound into silence
in his early years as a prosecutor , robert m morgenthau was once asked about the most effective way to fight organized crime at the time , mr morgenthau had made a name for himself as a united states attorney by indicting more than 100 mafia figures mr morgenthau raised a novel strategy maybe we ought to declare a moratorium on the prosecution of organized crime for five to 10 years , he told victor s navasky for a new york times magazine article in 1970 and let them become so rich that they will give up their predatory instincts and theyll be much more concerned about getting their children into college , law school , medical school and so forth , and theyll have lost their desire he never did declare that moratorium his years of doing battle with crime in all forms were just beginning mr morgenthau , now 97 and still working five days a week , was the district attorney for manhattan from 1975 until he retired at age 90 in 2009 , during which time crime in new york was completely transformed , and the city with it there were 648 murders in manhattan the year he took office when he left , there were 58 it was the kind of transformation no one at the time could have imagined rapes , assaults , robberies and property crimes similarly fell sharply streets , parks and whole neighborhoods were reinvented people who were dedicated to killing one another found other ways to settle their disputes on a recent lunch hour in his office at the firm wachtell , lipton , rosen katz , mr morgenthau was at a loss to explain just how it had all happened my theory was prompt and certain arrest , prosecution and punishment , he said if you commit a crime , the chances of you being arrested were pretty good and youd be prosecuted promptly i didnt believe in long sentences crime came down all over , but it came down much more in manhattan than any other place in the city or state we went from being the no 1 borough for murders to no 4 i never claimed credit for the drop in crime , because i thought if crime goes back up they can blame me so i never stuck my neck out his office in midtown manhattan , where he has worked since 2010 , faintly echoed the clutter of his former workplace , with stacks of papers covering the desk and shelves , and no computer in sight the lunch was no nonsense sandwiches and salads he recalled a night from his first months on the job , when he sat in a surveillance van on the lower east side of manhattan and watched dealers sell drugs openly , as a uniformed patrolman stood idly by people were getting away with it , he said and the police department wasnt really looking at any murders north of 96th street that was where it was walled off a severed head was found on edgecombe avenue in the 140s nobody was investigating to see who it was or what happened it wasnt news it wasnt important the numbers from his tenure are staggering mr morgenthau , a democrat , oversaw by his count 3 5 million cases , and he won nine elections and served under five mayors beame , koch , dinkins , giuliani , bloomberg he hired assistant district attorneys andrew m cuomo , sonia sotomayor , eliot spitzer , john f kennedy jr , cyrus r vance jr more than 80 of his prosecutors went on to be judges for better or worse , mr morgenthau said he brought cases against international drug cartels , money launderers , the murderer of john lennon , the preppy killer robert chambers and the son who swindled millions from brooke astor he was the boss in a cardigan sweater , with a gruff mouth and sometimes mismatched socks his prosecutors won hundreds of millions in settlements and judgments against white collar criminals , including l dennis kozlowski , the former chief executive of tyco international whose ill gotten luxuries included a 6 , 000 shower curtain they also wrongfully prosecuted five young african american and latino men for the rape and beating of a jogger in central park he was remarkably tenacious , said jeremy travis , president of john jay college of criminal justice , who was also a mayoral adviser and deputy commissioner of legal matters for the police department during parts of mr morgenthaus tenure he had a reputation for integrity , making tough calls and putting his name and reputation on the line in most elections he ran uncontested mr morgenthau became the model for the first district attorney on law order , played by steven hill , who the real district attorney thought was pretty good i was mad at him , mr morgenthau said because he came down to see me , and i had lunch with him and i told him , if you ever decide to retire , let me know in advance cause the report was he was getting 25 , 000 an episode i was half serious anyway , he resigned without telling me when mr morgenthau , in turn , left office , he told reporters he did not know what he would do next , but he was not ready to hang it up i got an email from my older brother who said this is a bad time to be looking for a job , he said robert morris morgenthau was born in 1919 , into a family that rose to great public influence through public service his grandfather henry morgenthau was president woodrow wilsons ambassador to turkey , where he unsuccessfully urged the united states to intervene in the turkish slaughter of armenians his father , henry morgenthau jr , was treasury secretary under his friend president franklin d roosevelt and persuaded the reluctant administration to intercede belatedly in the nazi slaughter of europes jews robert , the second of three children , grew up on the upper west side of manhattan and in upstate new york among the kennedys and the roosevelts i used to cook for mrs roosevelt , he said , volunteering a story he has told before we have some pictures of me cooking hot dogs for the queen but the most exciting thing for me was when f d r brought churchill down to our farm in 42 my ship , my destroyer , came into charleston navy yard and i got a weekend pass and i came home i made them mint juleps his father and the president planned to open a restaurant together if roosevelts political career went south , mr morgenthau said this for some reason has never got any attention , he said f d r was going to be the matre d , and my father was going to be the chief chef they actually bought the property for the young mr morgenthau , his public service career began with world war ii , where he served on a destroyer that was sunk by german torpedo bombers , then on another that spent almost two months under constant aerial attack those experiences , more than his relationship with the roosevelts , shaped his actions , said andrew meier , who is writing a family biography of the morgenthaus the future district attorney spent much of the 1940s and 50s coping with undiagnosed post traumatic stress , mr meier said , until president john f kennedy tapped him to be a united states attorney in 1961 in his midtown office , mr morgenthau said only that his brushes with death in the war drove him to do something useful with the rest of my life as a united states attorney , mr morgenthau built a reputation first for taking on the mafia and white collar criminals , and later for not leaving the job when a republican president , richard m nixon , took office and wanted him gone instead he lingered , pursuing cases that involved nixon campaign donors and telling reporters that if the president had asked him to stay on , he would have resigned immediately when he took over the district attorneys office , there were fewer than 300 prosecutors , many without desk phones , and crime was beginning a historic climb externally , he directed his resources toward violent crime , which dominated the public mind internally , he reorganized the department vertically , so the same prosecutor took on a case from arraignment to appeals , cutting the time for felony cases to 18 weeks from 32 weeks he started a career criminal program to go after the repeat offenders who commit a disproportionate share of crimes , and added the nations first sex crimes unit , a unit for gun crimes and a branch office in harlem , then a hotbed of crime the buzzwords that occur to me are ethics and professionalism , said richard m aborn , president of the citizens crime commission and a former prosecutor under mr morgenthau on ethics , from day 1 you understood that there were lines , and you didnt cross them and independence he was willing to yield decision making power he never overruled anything i did if there were mistakes along the way , like the wrongful 1990 prosecution of five young men on charges of raping and brutalizing a jogger in central park , mr morgenthau now had little interest in revisiting them as a matter of policy i dont look back , he said i dont say , i wish id done this , though there were some things i should have done but i didnt doesnt mean i think i did everything perfectly , i just try to close that chapter of the central park convictions , which were vacated after 12 years when a serial rapist confessed , followed by an eventual settlement of 41 million to the five men , mr morgenthau would say only that his office had erred but corrected the mistake when the new evidence emerged did i feel badly \? he said yeah , i felt badly we had screwed up but there were confessions i had complete confidence in linda fairstein , he continued , referring to the prosecutor who supervised the case turned out to be misplaced but we rectified it ms fairstein , who now writes crime novels and conducts training sessions with the district attorneys office , has defended the prosecution and investigation as sound mr morgenthaus mea culpa does not satisfy critics like ronald l kuby , a defense lawyer who often went up against his prosecutors , including in the appeal of one of the central park five robert morgenthaus tenure almost precisely tracked the era of mass incarceration , mr kuby said he was the dean and he could have used his moral authority to change that trajectory , and he was silent he was an active contributor to mass incarceration mr morgenthau said that on the contrary , he avoided seeking long sentences for offenders and that he instructed his staff not to prosecute people arrested on first time marijuana charges but he defended the strategy of prosecuting low level offenders like fare beaters because killers or rapists tended to commit lesser crimes as well and as violent crime fell in the late 1990s , with the end of the crack cocaine era , mr morgenthau shifted the offices resources to securities fraud , cybercrime and other white collar offenses , often entering turf battles with federal prosecutors in his last five years , his office recovered more than 1 billion from fines , settlements and forfeitures though he was accused of losing focus on neighborhood crime , he had pursued those long , difficult cases because a kid on the street can stick up a bodega , but he couldnt put his money offshore , he argued , adding , so all these people driving around in fancy cars , and you had to show them that justice was for everybody his successes earned him enemies and occasional threats i was pretty fatalistic about it , he said i didnt worry about the professional criminals , because i figured they knew what they were doing and theyd been through the system what i worried about was the kooks mr morgenthau said he got the most threatening letters when his office prosecuted plaxico burress , the new york giants wide receiver who in 2008 accidentally shot himself at a nightclub , and later pleaded guilty to gun charges professional criminals , he said , knew the risk they were taking in his current job , mr morgenthau has been lobbying to ease immigration laws and improve mental health care for military veterans , and helping the death penalty appeal in alabama of william ernest kuenzel , who was convicted in 1988 on testimony from witnesses who later proved unreliable mr morgenthau still reports to work every day , god willing , he said he gets on the treadmill most days and wears a heart monitor the stacks of paper in the office rise familiarly around him his assistant , ida van lindt , has been with him since he became district attorney when his cellphone rang during the lunch interview , the voice on the other end was loud enough to carry across the table his wife , lucinda franks , a former reporter for the new york times and the author of timeless love , morgenthau and me my boss , mr morgenthau said , answering the call im just calling to say i love you , the voice blared thank you , he told her i appreciate it as codas to a highly effectual public career , his current projects seem almost sisyphean , especially his push for looser immigration laws , which is unlikely to succeed in a trump administration my standpoint is , its payback time , he said , referring to the good fortune his family has enjoyed , starting with his immigrant grandfather i like what im doing , and i think what im doing is important i may be kidding myself he admitted that none of his projects were going well and like everyone else in new york , he is trying to make sense of a changing city , one in whose changes he played a part the streets are safer , mr morgenthau said , but these monstrosities have gone up , and the prices are out of sight people with money didnt flaunt it the way they do now , he continued i just think the huge skyscrapers , theres no communication between them and the street theres no sense of community you dont feel it i dont think thats good he remembered his childhood at 35 west 81st street , sandwiched between the columbus avenue elevated train and the eighth avenue streetcar we pride ourselves on how modern we are , but we had better local transportation than we do now , he said the fact that there was an el there kept the property values down but as a child it was an attraction you wake up at 2 oclock in the morning and hear a train rumbling by and you felt secure in an odd way it was as close as he came to pining for a bygone world , and as quickly as the sentiment rose it was gone again after more than half a century as a prosecutor , mr morgenthau knows you lose some cases , then gather yourself to fight another day because if you didnt lose , that would be the time to start worrying and unlike his law order counterpart , he cant simply go into reruns not yet , anyway

if youre in the retail business in the united states , you probably really care about these two things millennials and black friday but more and more , these two big drivers of the industry dont mix inside stores a dynamic that is reshaping one of the countrys biggest shopping days young people of all kinds , a coveted group for retailers because of their free spending ways , are increasingly turning to their computers and phones to do their holiday shopping , spreading out more widely the days they open their wallets crowds on friday , the unofficial kickoff of the holiday shopping season , will tilt older than a few years ago , and also , it appears , more cautious with their money as a result , the mix of retailers with high expectations for the day is changing quickly , skewing more toward dollar stores and discount retailers and toward essential products like food and cookware and it is also making the day itself less and less important for the industry over all as big as the event or the weekend has become , its substantially muted for the fact that all of the people are buying online , said mark a cohen , director of retail studies at columbia business school a decade ago , the day after thanksgiving accounted for 6 percent of all shopping for the holiday season , according to craig johnson , the president of customer growth partners , a research firm this year , he expects shoppers to spend 27 billion on black friday , but that will account for only 4 3 percent of the spending this season over all , people are expected to spend 632 billion this holiday season , up from 607 billion last year , the company estimates but for the first time , more than half that growth will come from online shopping , mr johnson said at the same time , there is a distinct division in who is shopping online more than half of baby boomers surveyed said they would do none of their holiday shopping online , according to a study by civicscience , a market research company nearly 40 percent of those age 18 to 34 the group known as millennials will do most or all of their shopping on the web , and another 35 percent said they would shop both online and in store that shift to online shopping has put more pressure on stores to offer deals good enough to bring people out into the cold less than a quarter of americans plan to shop in stores on black friday , down from 28 percent two years ago , according to a survey by bankrate com , a website that tracks savings products televisions , headphones and electronics , as always , are expected to be a big draw at big box stores like walmart and target department stores that offer big discounts , like macys , will remain a top destination during the weekend , too macys website is blanketed with its black friday promotions , with ads for everything from coats to apple watches to blenders black friday starts now ! declares a big banner at the top but discount and dollar stores , which generally havent been big draws on black friday , are also expecting strong sales over all , dollar stores will experience one of the biggest rises in turnout this year over last year , according to a survey of more than 2 , 000 adults by the data company nielsen phillip dengler , the co owner of the website bestblackfriday com , which monitors the annual sales , said he had seen more of a push from low budget stores this year he pointed to the discount chain dollar general as an example the company has extended its hours , and mr dengler said the chain had made more of an effort to get its black friday circulars online and in front of customers when you think about black friday , you dont think about dollar general , you think about walmart and target and amazon , mr dengler said theyre trying a little bit more discounters like dollar stores and so called off price stores like t j maxx and ross also are different in another way from rival retailers they have little to no e commerce presence that has made them somewhat immune to certain industry pressures , and could give them greater incentive to entice people into stores i think e commerce has allowed for black friday to start whenever amazon wants it to start , said simeon siegel , an analyst with nomura for the last few years , amazon has offered prime day , its own annual one day shopping bonanza that doesnt exist for t j and ross another trend working in favor of discount and dollar stores is the rising popularity of food and kitchen items , like mixers and cookware , as holiday gifts thats in part because of new fads like friendsgiving and friendsmas , when , you guessed it , friends rather than family get together for a holiday meal as a result , food is going to be more central to the holidays than ever before , said jordan rost , vice president for consumer insights at nielsen , in an email walmart , for example , said it would offer some specials on kitchen appliances for under 10 , as well as deals on nonstick cooking sets and griddles for the foodies interested in opening their wallets a little more , there are also plenty of pricier options , both online and in the stores harry david , the maker of gift baskets , is offering black friday deals on its arrangements of cheeses and fruits neiman marcuss notoriously opulent holiday offerings included collard greens for 66 , before they sold out \( if you missed it , theres also omas cheesy potatoes for 76 , plus 18 shipping \) more generally , though , stores at the higher end of the income spectrum like neiman marcus and bloomingdales , for instance have continued to more quietly promote their black friday sales i think the low end consumer is still looking for the best deal , but i think the higher end consumers are looking for the best products and the best services , said liz dunn , the founder and chief executive of talmage advisors , a consumer and retailing consulting firm i think its been a consistent theme for many , many years , she said , that these high end stores dont necessarily want to participate in the promotion
donald j trump sat down on tuesday with reporters , editors and columnists of the new york times for an exclusive interview times reporters have annotated portions of the interview the full transcript is available here the personal interactions between president obama and mr trump have so far been pleasant , but its not clear that the kumbaya moment will last mr obama has already indicated that he may weigh in against mr trump once the new administration takes over , especially if the new president attacks mr obamas legacy achievements here is our story on the cordial 90 minute meeting between mr trump and mr obama in the oval office mr trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming office , starting with this meeting at what he branded the failing new york times during his presidential campaign but he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and the times in particular here is more about mr trumps relationships with the news media and the times mr trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business empire , he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance but he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it this story has more about mr trumps business ties mr trump is correct that federal law , for the most part , exempts the president from conflict of interest rules , meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings but in modern times , most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts mr trump has said he does not intend to take such a step , instead will turn his companies over to his children read this story for more on mr trumps potential conflicts of interest the wall street journal editorial board , among others , has suggested that the only solution to mr trumps potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his assets , and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds mr trump suggests that this is not practical mr trumps crowds at rallies frequently targeted hillary clinton , chanting lock her up ! and referring to her as a criminal in july , mr trump himself encouraged a crowd in colorado , telling them im starting to agree with you as they chanted lock her up ! in addition , despite mr trumps remarks here , the f b i and the justice department , which have investigated mrs clintons email server and the clinton foundation , conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the white house a president attempting to intervene in those kinds of inquiries , in any direction , would be a major scandal here is our full story about mr trumps reversal on prosecuting mrs clinton mr trump has been criticized for not specifically denouncing bigotry and groups that spread bigoted views his statements about such conduct tend to be vague , including here , when he says i disavow the group that nonspecific language has been comforting to leaders of the alt right , a rebranded white nationalist movement , including richard b spencer , who led a gathering at a federal building near the white house last weekend that included some audience members offering a nazi salute mr trump here acknowledges , perhaps for the first time , that being president will perhaps help enrich his family he also concedes that the arrangement might fairly be called a conflict of interest back in february , when he was still a candidate , mr trump said definitively that torture was effective dont tell me it doesnt work torture works , he told an audience in south carolina o k , folks \? torture , you know , half these guys torture doesnt work believe me , it works o k \? so mr trumps answer on tuesday offered a revealing insight into his willingness to shift or rethink a position , especially after talking with someone he respects gen james n mattis may well be mr trumps secretary of defense , and his rejection of torture clearly had an effect on the president elect the reality is more complicated the number of factories and the number of americans who work in factories both have declined sharply in recent decades but the nations manufacturing output is at the highest level in history the labor intensive production of low value goods , like socks , has been replaced by the largely automated production of high value goods , like circuits in 1986 , president ronald reagan signed a landmark law that prohibited the hiring of illegal immigrants , provided new resources for enforcement along the mexican border and offered legal status to several million illegal immigrants experts say the law did little to slow migration to the united states , but made crossing the border more difficult and dangerous premiums for many health plans under the affordable care act are increasing 20 percent to 40 percent or more , but increases of 100 percent are extremely rare deductibles for many plans are high , but not 16 , 000 for a family plan in 2017 , the maximum out of pocket cost , including the deductible , is 14 , 300 mr trumps comments about his fellow republicans had a sharp edge and an implicit message they owe their congressional majority to him , and he expects to be treated accordingly whether this is true , and to what extent , will be one of the pivotal stories of the new trump administration , and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done he needs congress to achieve many of the campaign promises he made , including the deep tax cut and large infrastructure spending package , not to mention and it is an open question how in love with his policies republicans will prove to be read these stories for background on mr trumps relationships with republican leaders in congress , and the never trump stalwarts who are pondering the future of the conservative movement mr trump suggests here that he may name jared kushner , his son in law , as a special envoy to the middle east , charged with making peace between the israelis and the palestinians buried in this answer is an assertion by mr trump that the federal governments anti nepotism law does not apply to him as president , but he also says he would want to avoid the appearance of conflict installing mr kushner as a special envoy could have that effect , essentially giving him an important task that would allow him to be involved in high level national security deliberations without hiring him outright this is a role that was often discussed as a potential landing spot for bill clinton if mrs clinton had won the white house
for thanksgiving this year , many americans are anticipating turkey , mashed potatoes , pumpkin pie and postelection combat with relatives every election provokes some level of stress among voters , but mental health professionals say that the polarization of this years presidential race appeared to have amplified the tension it was a very significant stressor for people this year , said dr vaile wright , director of research and special projects at the american psychological association on tuesday , we asked readers to tell us whether they expected their thanksgiving gatherings to provide a stage for potential blowups as seldom seen relatives congregate for the first time since election day several people wrote to say they planned to adhere to a no political talk rule others said they were taking a more extreme approach avoiding thanksgiving get togethers altogether for those disappointed by the presidential outcome , much of the anxiety stemmed from concerns that relatives who supported donald j trump might gloat about his victory vince garcia , 48 , said he heard rumblings that two relatives were planning to wear trump gear at their thanksgiving gathering quite honestly im not looking forward to it at all , he wrote in an email martin johnson , a retired engineer in san clemente , said he and his wife worried that sparks could fly during their gathering of 18 family members about half are loyal democrats , he said , and half dedicated trump supporters if things get out of hand , mr johnson , 66 , said he planned to tell his guests just put all that stuff in a shoe box and put it on a shelf lets just not get into that topic dr wright said avoiding politics was sometimes the right approach if the election outcome is weighing heavily on your mind , thanksgiving can be a time to talk about it , she said but if reconnecting with family is whats most important , it could be wise to just postpone the political talk for another time kathy winter , 61 , a reader in san diego , wrote in with a reminder that thanksgiving is intended to be a moment to count blessings and connect with family but , she added , if we are all mature adults , we should be able to talk politics the salinas valley , known as the salad bowl of the nation , is struggling with a crisis of poverty and malnutrition among its farmworkers the new york times californias largest state workers union said it would strike in december over a contract dispute sacramento bee michelle rhee , sacramentos first lady and the former head of the washington , d c , schools , appeared to take herself out of the running to become education secretary in the trump administration sacramento bee two weeks after election day , proposition 66 was finally called the measure , intended to speed up death row appeals , passed los angeles times also called was proposition 53 , which would have given voters more say over megaprojects it failed the associated press disney has big plans for its hong kong resort a 1 4 billion upgrade the new york times facebook is said to have created a censorship tool in an effort to get back into china the new york times a memorial service for a slain sheriffs deputy in stanislaus county was filled with laughter and tears modesto bee defying expectations , the oakland raiders are now 8 2 after beating the texans in mexico city the new york times most people know jack london as a prolific writer few know him as a photographer the new york times our nation is diverse how does that play out in what we eat at thanksgiving \? the new york times still in need of a quick thanksgiving recipe \? we asked cortney burns , a chef at bar tartine in san francisco , to suggest a dish that takes advantage of the fall season she offered this one from a book she wrote with nicolaus balla , bar tartine techniques recipes , winner of a 2015 james beard award potato and green bean soup this is a soup to make in late summer , or autumn when the days get shorter and the green beans grow big and tough it is ideal for those end of season beans , which are much better cooked well past the bright green and crisp stage that culinary professionals prize in this soup , the beans are cooked grandmother style , until they are quite tender and develop a deep , earthy flavor the butter that floats on the surface of this soup is essential to the soups texture and flavor we recommend you use cultured butter , which has a subtle tang you can make it yourself or buy it 1 tbsp filtered grapeseed oil or good cooking oil 1 sweet white onion , cut into 14 in 6 mm dice 4 garlic cloves , minced 3 cups 720 ml vegetable or poultry broth 12 oz 335 g russet potatoes , peeled and cut into 14 in 6 mm dice 1 lb 455 g green beans , trimmed and cut into 34 in 2 cm pieces 3 cups 720 ml buttermilk 1 tbsp plus 2 tsp kosher salt freshly ground black pepper 1 cup 240 ml sour cream 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar 2 tbsp butter , melted chopped fresh flat leaf parsley for garnish chopped fresh dill for garnish chopped fresh chives for garnish heat a medium saucepan over medium heat until a drop of water flicked on the surface sizzles gently on contact add the grapeseed oil , then immediately add the onion and garlic and cook , stirring occasionally , until the vegetables are slightly softened but not browned , about 10 minutes add the broth , potatoes and green beans and simmer until the potatoes are tender enough to be easily pierced with a skewer , about 25 minutes remove from the heat in a blender , combine 2 cups 475 ml of the broth and vegetables and the buttermilk and pure until smooth add the pure back to the saucepan , add the salt and 12 tsp pepper , and place over medium heat bring to a simmer and cook gently until heated through , about five minutes remove from the heat and stir in 34 cup 180 ml of the sour cream and the vinegar ladle the soup into individual bowls and garnish with melted butter , the remaining 14 cup 60 ml sour cream , the parsley , dill , chives , and plenty of pepper leftover soup will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days
who says the most useful start up ideas come from millennials fresh from dropping out of stanford \? some recent tech based financial innovations havent come from venture capitalists or young hotshots but rather from professionals who have toiled away in their industry for decades sheryl rowling , 60 , is a financial planner in san diego who was constantly overwhelmed by the complexity of rebalancing her clients portfolios in portfolio management , rebalancing requires periodic adjustment of client holdings to a preset target of stocks , bonds and cash assembled to meet their goals while minimizing taxes although advisers need to keep clients on track with investment goals , rebalancing is often tedious and complex the process was even more demanding because ms rowling placed high priority on incorporating tax saving strategies as well over the years , she realized that portfolio rebalancing could be automated with the right software about 10 years ago , her firm was one of the first to put in place one of the early rebalancing software solutions the software cost 50 , 000 a year and it took two people 20 hours a week for six months to gear up when the future of that program became uncertain , ms rowling decided there had to be a better way she figured if she could design a simpler , more affordable , tax savvy solution for her own firm , it would also be useful to others most bread and butter advisers couldnt afford six months and 50 , 000 a year to automate rebalancing , ms rowling said i thought there could be a better , more affordable solution although ms rowling had no experience in software coding , she assembled a team to create a program she financed the development using revenue from her advisory practice , which now has 270 million in assets under management in 2007 , the product that emerged was total rebalance expert , or trx , which automates the rebalancing process for advisory firms and saves clients money on taxes several years later , ms rowlings company caught the attention of morningstar , the chicago based financial information giant it was so impressed with the product that it acquired total rebalance expert last november for an undisclosed amount at the time of the acquisition , more than 500 advisers from 175 firms used the software to rebalance some 20 billion in client assets ms rowling epitomizes the model of the internal start up unlike the typical profile of a tech oriented millennial , some entrepreneurs are middle age , have been in a profession for decades and never thought they would be creating in demand software companies like these eschew the traditional route of angel and venture capital investing after running businesses for years david lyon , 41 , who was a chicago based registered investment adviser , followed a similar path a few years ago , he realized that he needed a simple way of effectively communicating with clients about changes in their portfolios or financial plans client communication can often be a problem in the financial advice business advisers need to connect with clients regularly , particularly when there are market blips but busy clients are hard to pin down for a phone call or office visit and may only be seen twice a year for face to face review meetings , according to a survey by the financial planning association to address that , mr lyon started building his own software in 2012 he had a workable package a year later what emerged was oranj , a cloud based platform that allows advisers to maximize time and provide the same level of service across account size when some 50 other advisory firms heard about his software , they wanted it , too he charges other companies a one time setup fee of 500 plus 250 a month for the first user and 100 for each additional user mr lyon said his tool allowed advisers to connect with 73 percent of their clients each year for annual reviews , a vast improvement from the 46 percent that the average practice did , according to the financial planning association survey like many professionals engaged in their own start ups , mr lyon also self financed , or bootstrapped , the development of oranj he eventually sold his advisory practice to focus on oranj he would not disclose revenue for his platform , but said his sales growth was 225 percent year to date since 2015 he has hired 47 employees and serves 400 advisory firms oranj has plenty of competition there are dozens of advisory platforms on the market , but oranj helps advisers avoid conflicts of interest , mr lyon said the platform lets advisers track every client email , call and portfolio change on one dashboard page and clients receive investment advice thats agnostic , that is , not wedded to one investment manager still , not every adviser will find it easy to break into the so called fintech , or financial technology , field the sector is already crowded and is hyper focused on moving money , not managing it according to pricewaterhousecoopers , the global consulting firm , funding for fintech start ups doubled from 2014 to 2015 , from 5 6 billion to 12 2 billion most of that money , though , is going to companies targeting financial infrastructure such as consumer banking and fund transfer and payments more opportunities may lay , at least according to pricewaterhousecoopers , in the area of asset and wealth management , an industry slow to change some overhauls are coming about as a result of the labor departments recent rule mandating that financial advisers offering retirement advice act in the best interests of clients under the new fiduciary rule , which goes into effect in april 2017 , advisers must show that they are not giving conflicting advice in the products or advice they offer it has been widely speculated that the republican dominated congress and white house will challenge it or roll back the rules but until that happens , millions of financial advisers , brokers and agents are setting out to meet the conditions of the rule as a practical matter , this means that advisers must also be able to prove to a regulator that an investment is in the best financial interests of their client and not done just to generate a commission for the adviser despite the intense competition to provide financial advice , these start ups have many opportunities to tap for example , most of the new robo advisers that provide automated advice on investments are not set up for customized advice on portfolio , tax , estate and post retirement planning and older clients need to optimize social security benefits , manage retirement withdrawals , monitor tax efficiency and keep up with their investments those create openings for advisers who can come up with practical solutions in house , a growing trend in recent years for professionals seeking to start a business , getting off the ground can be the most difficult part ms rowling said she went into her start up navely and didnt realize the extent to which technology had to change she also realized that her project took more capital and time than she imagined in addition , after feedback from customers , she had to make adjustments ultimately , though , sometimes solving everyday problems left her feeling at the forefront of entrepreneurship it requires a lot of capital to create something theres a wide need for , ms rowling added always be on the cutting edge
if you think back to this years presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning hillary clintons email troubles and donald j trumps various controversies , you wouldnt be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about jobs , the economy and taxes , thats because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is strong , but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate personality , campaign strategy and assessments of whos winning , instead of on policies and ideas but this year , the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific topics candidate traits or characteristics , and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the candidates fitness for office \( or lack of it \) than they did the nations economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson hexagon , i categorized the campaign news coverage of 23 media outlets this consisted of four broadcast networks three cable news networks national public radio and hugh hewitt on the radio two online news sites and 12 newspapers i specifically searched for news about mrs clintons campaign and her email server or her campaign and wikileaks , and several controversies connected to mr trumps campaign \( including things like trump university , the khan family and the access hollywood video \) i also looked for news about the candidates campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list isnt exhaustive , but it gives a sense of the trade off between coverage of these controversies and the economy the candidates controversies received more coverage , on average , than their views on the economy from june until election day , 38 percent of the stories mentioned mr trumps various missteps , and 35 percent mentioned mrs clintons email only 17 percent mentioned mr trump and jobs or the economy , and only 10 percent cited mrs clintons campaign and the economy closer to the election , from oct 8 on , the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the access hollywood video and a few weeks before f b i director james b comeys letter to congress from this point , 53 percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss mrs clintons email , while only 6 percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for mr trump , 31 percent mention his entanglements , while 10 percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the candidates character is striking , as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video release , between oct 15 and election day , roughly half \( 56 percent \) of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned mrs clintons emails , and only a quarter \( 26 percent \) discussed mr trump and his imbroglios a mere 7 percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned mrs clinton and the economy \( 11 percent mentioned mr trump and the economy \) these choices have consequences according to the gallup organization , americans reports of what they heard or read about mrs clinton between june and september were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in contrast , mentions of mr trump changed week by week , tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news media , its important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse accurately , then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the candidates choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the case , i used data from kantar media cmag on all the candidates campaign ads aired between june and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television mrs clinton made more ads than mr trump , and she vastly out advertised him , running nearly three times as many ads as he did all told , over half a million ads were run in 2016 during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other persons character in fact , the losing candidates ads did little else more than three quarters of the appeals in mrs clintons advertisements \( and nearly half of mr trumps \) were about traits , characteristics or dispositions only 9 percent of mrs clintons appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by contrast , 34 percent of mr trumps appeals focused on the economy , jobs , taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in 1952 , no campaign has made 76 percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on average , traits typically garner about 22 percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about 28 percent of the appeals theres usually much more balance of course , this was an unusual election year , with two very unpopular candidates , so the candidates flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the reason , the criterion of fitness for office dominated the clinton campaigns messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as well , and the news media covered it
losing your wallet or having it stolen is a nuisance anytime , but when youre on vacation , it can ruin the hope of a good trip , according to chris mcgoey , a security consultant who has traveled to more than 110 countries people carry critical personal information like credit cards and a drivers license in their wallet , and a lost or stolen one is a bigger headache and harder to recover from when youre traveling , he said but there are ways to minimize the damage from that missing wallet and keep your trip from going awry , and mr mcgoey shared advice on how to do just that know your wallets contents you know your wallet is important , but do you know whats in it \? in his training seminars , mr mcgoey said that he has his attendees look inside their wallets and he finds that most are surprised at what they unearth people have insurance cards , credit cards and other pieces of personal information they forgot they had , but if you dont know whats in your wallet , you cant report it missing , he said he suggests keeping an inventory of your wallets contents in your email or on an encrypted cloud server such as google drive or dropbox carry only essentials most people carry too many credit and atm cards in their wallet , mr mcgoey said , advising that you travel with only the ones you rely on daily also , dont carry both your social security card and drivers license in your wallet because one piece of identification is generally sufficient when youre traveling the more personal information you lose , the more work you have to do to get replacements , he said have backups of documents make copies of all the documents in your wallet , and leave these copies with a family member or trusted neighbor back at home and include a checklist of phone numbers to call in case your wallet goes missing , such as the numbers of your bank and credit card company you can also scan and email these copies to yourself or store them on a cloud server these backups and numbers allow you to quickly report your cards missing also , if youre flying , you wont be left without the identification you need to get back home in addition , mr mcgoey suggested having a copy of a backup credit card on your email or cloud server and leaving the actual card at home with someone you trust if you need a replacement right away , that person can send you the card overnight rely on the u s embassy if youre traveling internationally and end up losing your wallet but have no backups of your credit cards and license , the local united states embassy is your best resource to get your life back in order the embassy can help you get temporary identification and also loan you cash , mr mcgoey said your tour company , if you used one , may also be able to assist

in early october , yurie adachi , a member of the japanese womens national hockey team , was preparing for a late night practice in tokyo when she met a visitor from new york adachi , who does not speak much english , smiled and offered a one word greeting riveters since junior high school , adachi has played with nana fujimoto , the japanese goaltender who competed in the inaugural season of the national womens hockey league in 2015 adachi kept track of fujimoto with the riveters , the leagues new york area franchise that now plays its home games in newark canada , united states are wonderful environments for hockey , adachi said through an interpreter , sitting in an aging rink where water from the roof leaked onto the ice the formation of the n w h l was a significant moment female hockey players in the united states would finally receive salaries as professionals the first season of operation was largely deemed a success , with paid attendance , the league said , of 1 , 000 per game so the n w h l s players were staggered when they were notified on thursday that their salaries would be cut to keep the league afloat this season according to the league , average attendance has dropped to 600 now , with the future of the n w h l uncertain , players are calling for more transparency from the league office theyve made that clear , that we need to rebuild some trust , dani rylan , the n w h l s commissioner , said on sunday during the riveters 4 0 win over the connecticut whale in newark i think trust is a two way street even though it was an unfortunate set of circumstances , it might end up realigning us and putting us back on that path together this season , player salaries ranged from 10 , 000 to 26 , 000 originally , some players said , they were told that salaries would be cut in half but multiple sources with direct knowledge of the leagues finances confirmed the actual pay cut would be 38 percent , the reduction softened by a recent 50 , 000 contribution by dunkin donuts meanwhile , many players are troubled because they have received little information about the leagues condition there are many things since their inception that have been a state secret , said brant feldman , managing partner of american group management , who has represented womens hockey players since 2006 if you operate something without a public image to it , i get it , but if youre operating a sports league of any sort , you need things done in a public facing manner n w h l players , in a statement released saturday through social media , called for an independent audit of the leagues finances , disclosure of the identity of investors and an explanation of why revenue has diminished so quickly the biggest thing is we need transparency right now , riveters forward bray ketchum said of the players demands , rylan said there are some things we will work with the players on there are some demands that we might not be able to , but i think that we are committed to working together on sunday , the leagues four teams the riveters , the whale , the boston pride and the buffalo beauts played for the first time since the salary cuts getting back on the ice had the effect of cooling emotions some players had contemplated walking away from the league rather than accept its new circumstances i can understand how much it hurts them and if they feel a bit betrayed and they cant trust this league right now , pride forward rachel llanes said the league has a players association , but there is no collective bargaining agreement christopher fusco , managing partner of the law firm callahan and fusco , has a background in sports and employment law he said he thought cutting salary without any negotiations was an unfair labor practice but without a collective bargaining agreement , he added , players do not have much recourse unless they are willing to walk out opt out clauses were added to player contracts this season , but few are likely to use them for the players , a 38 percent pay cut meant that game preparation was replaced by questions about paying rent , getting out of leases or becoming eligible for unemployment benefits the riveters have been discussing ways to raise money and pitch in to help teammates under serious financial strain riveters defender kiira dosdall and other players also thought the role of the players association should be reassessed on the management side , rylan said she had no doubt this season would be completed but added that attracting sponsors had been harder than expected before dunkin donuts agreed to give 50 , 000 toward salaries , players had received 400 dunkin donuts gift cards each season tom manchester , the companys vice president for field marketing in the united states , said it was possible the company would provide further salary contributions although the n h l has collaborated with the n w h l , there is no formal partnership between the two , or with the canadian womens hockey league , another womens professional league , which is in its 10th season in an email , an n h l spokesman said that the league was supportive of womens hockey but that it had always questioned the viability of two professional womens leagues and the sustainability of the current business model riveters forward janine weber said everyone understood the risks involved in joining a start up venture that was bound to encounter setbacks amid these flaws , the n w h l has had its groundbreaking moments , as well kelsey koelzer is believed to be the first african american taken first over all in a top tier american hockey league draft when the riveters selected her in june last month , harrison browne became the first openly transgender athlete in professional team sports in north america the league has also continually raised money for denna laing , the pride player who was badly injured last december during an outdoor game at gillette stadium in foxborough , mass the league , which this season has a 21 game schedule that runs from october to april , and rosters with up to 23 players , has provided a showcase for stars of the united states national team , effectively expanding the quadrennial spotlight of the olympics this has been enticing for international players like fujimoto who are looking to test their skills against the worlds best for american women who do not make the national team , hockey no longer has to end after college ashley johnston , the riveters captain , works as a mechanical engineer in albany and commutes to newark for practices and games johnston , who believed her career was over after graduating from union college in 2014 , has become a fan favorite as a players association representative , johnston was among the first to learn of the cuts , in her case through a conference call with the league on thursday she cried as she told her teammates the news some within the league believed the n w h l would have folded if the players sat out sundays games members of the pride and the riveters confirmed that their teams discussed not playing , but they chose instead to take the ice i definitely get it , johnston said of dissenting feelings toward the league that is an immediate reaction again , theres nothing easy about this situation llanes , who runs a side business as a coach and trainer , was upset with the salary cuts but saw a chance to change the league for the better im going to continue to look at this from a business standpoint , she said it happens everywhere in the real world its huge for us it gives us an opportunity to take a step in a different direction maybe we can ask a little bit more of ourselves to grow the game you see the u s national team for soccer , the amount they had to put in that was huge i dont think were anywhere near that yet the league is on break until dec 3 rylan said she was working through the thanksgiving holiday to find solutions its a crucial two weeks , johnston said things take time we might not necessarily have all the solutions , but we can have plans

kara waite , an english teacher at bunker hill community college in charlestown , mass , made a rule for herself for every political rant she posts on facebook , she must pick up the phone and call a legislator its kind of a swear jar for political action , ms waite said recently ms waite , who volunteers for liberal causes and who created a widely shared document last week to teach others her methods , figures that a phone ringing off the hook is more difficult for a lawmaker to ignore than a flooded inbox activists of all political stripes recommend calling legislators , not just emailing and certainly not just venting on social media several lawmakers , along with those who work for them , said in interviews that ms waite is right a phone call from a constituent can , indeed , hold more weight than an email , and far outweighs a facebook post or a tweet to understand why , it helps to know what happens when someone answers the phone at a legislators office emily ellsworth , whose jobs have included answering phones in the district offices of two republican representatives from utah jason chaffetz , from 2009 to 2012 and chris stewart from 2013 to 2014 said the way your points reach a lawmaker depends on how many calls the office is getting at the time and how you present your story in some cases , its a simple process when a caller offered an opinion , staff members would write the comments down in a spreadsheet , compile them each month and present reports to top officials , she said if the lawmaker had already put out a statement on the issue , the staff member would read it to the caller , she said but a large volume of calls on an issue could bring an office to a halt , sometimes spurring the legislator to put out a statement on his or her position , ms ellsworth said she recommended the tactic in a series of tweets shared thousands of times it brings a legislative issue right to the top of the mind of a member , she said it makes it impossible to ignore for the whole staff you dont get a whole lot else done when her branch in utah received a lot of calls , she contacted the washington office and coordinated the messaging , involving the communications director , the legislative director or the chief of staff , ms ellsworth said while scripts found on the internet can be useful for people uncomfortable talking on the phone , she suggested making the phone calls as personal as possible in some cases , if she was moved by a call , she would pass on the comments to her district director , she said what representatives and staffers want to hear is the individual impact of your individual story , she said i couldnt listen to peoples stories for six to eight hours a day and not be profoundly impacted by them a new york state senator , phil boyle , a republican , said that one of his staff members would contact him after a constituent called his office , and that he would try to call everyone back thats a perk exclusive to those who call in , since he sometimes gets more than 300 emails per day , he said i couldnt possibly do that for emails , mr boyle said when its a subject in which he lacks expertise , he said , the calls have made a difference in one case , several retired law enforcement officers called him about a gun control law that was enacted in 2013 , worried that they would have to give up their service revolvers senator boyle , who said he doesnt use firearms much , was unaware of that possibility and proposed an amendment to grant them an exception gov andrew m cuomo granted the exception seven months after the law was passed most calls can be handled by staff members , said brian kolb , the republican minority leader in the new york state assembly many callers just want to express an opinion and dont even offer a name , he said in other cases , callers who want to talk out an issue more fully could be directed to a staff member who has expertise in the area , said state senator liz krueger , a democrat in new york ms waite , who has had a calendar reminder for each monday morning alerting her to call party leadership , said that first time callers often fear they will be quizzed or interrogated , but that they generally just need to offer their opinion and basic personal information , like name and city she implored people to be courteous , since the staff members might be getting many calls communicate in a way that someone cant ignore , ms waite said
your phone is pretty much a high tech bucket of germs thousands of microscopic bugs crawl around on its surface remnants of dirty , old skin cells smudge its cover tiny hairs stick inside its buttons and your hands have smeared hundreds of chemicals across its surface the foundation on your face , the antidepressants you take , the shampoo in your shower and even the hard core mosquito repellent you applied down in panama four months ago all of these things leave traces on your hands and phone thats why scientists say they can use your phone to learn a lot about your lifestyle in a study published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences last week , pieter dorrestein , a biochemist at the university of california , san diego , and his colleagues asked can scientists or maybe one day police investigators profile a person chemically , based on the objects he or she possesses \? they started with your phone , which you touch on average , about 2 , 617 times a day in the study , they swabbed the hands of 39 people , along with their phones , producing hundreds of chemical samples then they used techniques from biochemistry to break down , analyze and identify some of the chemicals , matching them with entries in a database of crowdsourced chemical structures based on the compounds common to both hands and phones , they made inferences about each persons lifestyle , like whether they drank tea or coffee , liked citrus fruits or spent time in the sun not every molecule is a clue , said dr dorrestein , but those that are enable you to build a lifestyle sketch of the particular owner or user of that object the study , which was funded by the national institute of justice , a research agency of the united states department of justice , calls these high tech deductions molecular lifestyle signatures , which could be used in criminal investigations to narrow down a subject pool when dna or fingerprint evidence doesnt yield a match some legal experts said the technique could improve upon the subjective impressions of investigators this is not different in kind from what happens all the time in criminal investigation , except that it purports to do it more systematically , more scientifically , and potentially more reliably , frederick schauer , a law professor at the university of virginia who has written about profiling and stereotyping and was not involved in the study , wrote in an email the suggestion is worrisome to some forensic scientists its easy to imagine the scenario playing out in a courtroom drama no match from the dna in the phone \? pull out the test tubes turn on the mass spectrometer cue the montage music if you watch a lot of tv and films , you can think this is whats coming next , said brent turvey , a forensic scientist and criminal profiler but dr turvey says that exaggerating the techniques potential could take the actual science too far too soon , as it has with gunshot residue analysis as gunshot residue became a greater part of investigations , forensic scientists determined that it can turn up in places other than the hands of a person who fired a gun , potentially creating false positives while chemical profiling could one day find its way to a crime lab for use in limited circumstances , dr schauer said there was a fat chance it would ever make it into the courtroom expert evidence has to reach an extremely high standard for admission at trials , which the technique may not be able to meet jonathan koehler , a behavioral scientist at the northwestern university pritzker school of law , worries that if this technique were to take off , investigators might ignore or undervalue other leads and push courts to prematurely admit evidence based on potentially inaccurate inferences i dont smoke and am rarely around cigarette smoke , but i just happened to be around someone yesterday who was smoking up a storm , he said so what would detection of nicotine on my iphone really say about my lifestyle , other than something really misleading \? dr dorrestein , the studys lead author , acknowledged that even if a chemical profile could narrow down a pool of suspects , later proving someones identity , and perhaps their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt , ultimately comes down to a full investigation that means your filthy phone is more likely to reveal that you remembered your meds or sunscreen than it is to nail you in court
president elect donald j trump said on tuesday that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into hillary clintons use of a private email server or the financial operations of her familys foundation , dropping the lock her up pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the white house mr trump , who branded his rival crooked hillary and said she would go to jail if he were president , said in an interview with reporters and editors at the new york times that he was no longer interested in pursuing mrs clinton , in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign i dont want to hurt the clintons , i really dont , mr trump said during the interview she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways , and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was vicious his reversal on prosecuting mrs clinton was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential campaign , in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent theme , and one she has blamed for her loss to mr trump mr trump said he wanted to move forward from the subject without elaborating , he said that well have people that do things , perhaps a reference to the f b i or republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases but the president elect made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office the decision angered some of his most fervent supporters , who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart broken promise , blared the headline on breitbart news , a conservative news site that has strongly backed mr trump its not something that i feel very strongly about , mr trump said at the times , unlike health care or immigration this has been a very painful period of time clinton aides did not respond to a request for comment about mr trumps remarks during their second debate , mr trump turned to mrs clinton and vowed , if i win , i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation , because theres never been so many lies , so much deception after mr trumps turnaround on tuesday , the conservative commentator ann coulter , one of his staunchest supporters during the campaign , suggested on twitter that mr trump was overstepping his role whoa ! i thought we elected realdonaldtrump president , she wrote did we make him the fbi , doj \? his job is to pick those guys , not do their jobs tom fitton , president of judicial watch , a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of mrs clinton , said on tuesday that it would be a mistake for mr trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use mr fitton said that although the f b i had already investigated the matter twice , that inquiry was flawed his group has gained access to thousands of pages of mrs clintons state department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat representative jason chaffetz , a utah republican who leads the house oversight and government reform committee , said last week on fox news that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because weve got to get to the truth mr chaffetzs office said on tuesday he was unavailable for comment about mr trumps statements although the f b i s email investigation is closed , the agency still has an open inquiry into the clinton foundation that inquiry began after the 2015 publication of clinton cash , a book by peter schweizer that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for state department favors when mrs clinton was there the clintons have denied the assertions the f b i and justice department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the white house , so mr trump cannot tell agents to close their cases a president ordering the f b i to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal it does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that decision , glen a kopp , a former federal prosecutor in new york , said of the president elect i know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal matter if , as president , mr trump were to order the f b i director , james b comey , to close the foundation inquiry , mr comey could choose to rebuff him f b i directors are given 10 year terms to insulate them from political pressure , but the president still has the power to fire a director , as president bill clinton did with william s sessions in 1993 after a justice department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by mr sessions in an interview last week with cbs newss 60 minutes , mr trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss mr comey over his handling of the clinton email investigation , saying the director may have had very good reasons for doing what he did as a practical matter , though , mr trumps remarks will probably have little impact the investigation into mrs clintons emails is already closed and , while the one into her familys foundation remains open , senior f b i officials and career justice department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case when the case comes up for review , senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it down , but it will not be because of mr trumps remarks while the president elects decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the f b i , who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they uncover , some legal experts applauded mr trumps decision to not pursue investigations into mrs clintons emails or her family foundation rory k little , a professor at the university of california hastings college of the law , said he was inclined to support both moves by mr trump a decision to shut down an investigation , he said , is not out of step with constitutional constraints , as the constitution gives the president the power to issue pardons for federal crimes
this years election has forced americans to take notice of class divisions between workers and while these divisions may at first ring of lazy stereotypes the rural rust belt worker without a college degree and the coastal urban college educated worker theyre rooted in a real dynamic many of the most skilled workers young people with college degrees are leaving struggling regions of america for cities , specifically for cities in southern and coastal states there are clear economic reasons for their choice dense metro areas tend to produce more jobs and make workers more productive wages , for all kinds of workers , are also higher in theory , these incentives should prompt workers of all levels of education to move to metro areas but moving outside ones region is relatively rare these days , and even more rare for someone without a college degree moving is actually quite uncommon in advanced economies the united states has been one of the exceptions it has one of the highest rates of internal migration among advanced economies , and it has since at least the middle of the 19th century a study comparing thousands of american and british census records between 1850 and 1880 showed that nearly two thirds of american men moved across county lines , while only a quarter of british men did for americas first century , internal migration was largely driven by farming moving west to new land but toward the end of the 19th and in the early 20th century , migration began to be driven by people moving to american cities small and large this pattern added a twist after world war ii , when more people began moving outside their local region , particularly to the sunbelt before the 1940s , roughly 15 percent of americans lived outside a census division in which they were born , and by 1970 that had jumped to 25 percent but in the 1980s , people started moving less internal migration has been in gradual decline ever since across all demographic groups in the 1980s , 3 percent of men moved across state lines each year over the last decade that figure has dropped to 1 7 percent the decline is similar for women between 2001 and 2010 , the demographic groups with the lowest rate of interstate migration were people with less than a high school diploma \( 1 percent \) or nothing beyond a high school diploma \( 1 2 percent \) migration rates for college educated people were roughly twice that in the regional competition for the most skilled and most mobile workers in america , many noncoastal states are at a disadvantage although they have some large cities , they tend to be farther from other large cities than is the case in the coastal areas the economists stuart rosenthal and william strange looked at the benefits of density and found that they tend to dissipate over distances greater than five miles this advantage provided by clusters of cities is helpful for coastal states , which tend to contain many big metro areas , like san diego , los angeles , san jose and san francisco in california , or the so called acela corridor stretching from washington to boston but it can be bad news for inland areas with one or two large cities that are farther apart omaha and kansas city , mo , say or cleveland and columbus , ohio the flows of young college graduates out of a state can often be replaced by flows of young college graduates moving in the problem that many interior states face is that young college graduates moving into the state arent keeping up with those that are leaving lots of talented young people all over the country are eager to see new sights what is different , and a problem for michigan is that we have an unusually low rate of immigration , said charley ballard , a regional economist at michigan state university , in an email keeping young college graduates would help alleviate the effects of globalization and technological change on these local economies its not surprising that many states with net losses in their young and college educated populations also showed some big gains for donald j trump relative to mitt romneys performance in 2012 the map shows the total net migration figures for those with a college degree under 40 between 2000 and 2015 \( people who grew up in one state , went to college in another and then moved somewhere else are counted as migrating from the state where they attended college \) generally , rust belt and midwest states like ohio , michigan and iowa , and plains states like south dakota and nebraska have seen the largest net losses in younger , college educated people the places that are gaining college graduates tend to be coastal and southern states like california , maryland , texas and south carolina two exceptions to this trend are new york and massachusetts , states that also produce a large number of college graduates to begin with \( harsh winters and a high cost of living could be factors \) one reason that inland states have a reasonable case for disappointment at not keeping their young college graduates theyre helping to pay to educate them a majority of college graduates get their degrees from public universities , which are partly funded by state governments of course this doesnt diminish the other important benefits that public universities bring to each states economy , but if states are losing more college graduates than they are holding or bringing in , theyre effectively subsidizing other states skilled labor forces cities in these states do have some advantages the cost of living is lower , mostly because housing is cheaper outdoor recreation is often more accessible still , these areas are in a bind without jobs to offer , luring young college educated people is hard at the same time , its hard to create jobs without a college educated labor force to mr ballard , its not clear that one policy proposal exists that could jump start the process it really is a chicken and egg problem , he said i dont think theres anybody out there that thinks theres some quick , easy solution in the days when cities competed for manufacturing , advertising low wages and reliable utilities was often enough to draw businesses mr ballard pins his hopes of attracting more young , college educated workers to michigan on efforts to market cultural amenities and natural beauty he points to the grand rapids artprize , an arts festival that awards half a million dollars to artists , as something that has brought some cultural cachet to that city , michigans second largest its not all about jobs , mr ballard said youve got to have it be a place where people want to live
maybe i shouldnt have been surprised that donald trump could be elected president , but i was i live in brooklyn and work in manhattan , two of the most liberal places in the country but even online , i wasnt seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness occur \? social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my community , into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in hindsight , that failure makes sense ive spent nearly 10 years coaching facebook and instagram and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i dont want to see , and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an article , or clicked on a link , or hid another , the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i didnt realize that most of my family members , who live in rural virginia , were voicing their support for trump online , and i didnt see any of the pro trump memes that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds , and the only election day selfies i saw were of people declaring their support for hillary clinton to be clear , im not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my worldview they did exactly what i told them to do , blocking out racist , misogynist and anti immigrant comments , hiding anyone who didnt support black lives matter , all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than 40 percent of our countrys population consumes news on facebook , finding alternative perspectives shouldnt have been that hard i knew about eli parisers theory on filter bubbles , or the idea that online personalization distorts the type of information we see , and even so , i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my fingertips , and yet i didnt look in april , mark zuckerberg , chief executive of facebook , addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network facebook , he said , has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet the internet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever before , he said weve gone from a world of isolated communities to one global community , and we are all better off for it but thats not what has happened zuckerbergs idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on facebook , the political divide has only been entrenched further its the buzzfeed dress debate , only for our entire lives we are two countries , one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the internet once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like facebook and instagram is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into it , but there have still been a few islands of digital wilderness , a galpagos of sorts , where culture thrived untouched they included vine \( whose closure was announced in october \) and snapchat , and even tumblr , which were homes for marginalized ideas , theories and lifestyles the video sharing app vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my own , including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see them prospering , aware a young woman living in saudi arabia who goes by the name amy roko used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the mall , goofing off at home in her most viral video , she stares into the camera , her face covered in a niqab , save for her perfectly outlined eyes expletive called me ugly , she snaps i said , expletive where \? the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one niqab to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an app and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the network , and people did so with abandon , meaning that vines appeared scattershot around the web , defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text message , direct message , email rokos vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black american named brionna london , who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty you can draw a straight line from brown women in saudi arabia to black women in america , a marvel unto itself , a window into the way the internet flattens space and time a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides at vines peak , it had more than 200 million monthly users who watched videos billions of times , and it excelled at showing these sorts of commonalities that , say , black kids in new orleans lived and looked a lot like white kids in florida \( at the very least , they shared a similar humor and taste in music , which gave me hope that they would share a sense of humanity as well \) and yet twitter , which owns vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to advertisers , could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature \( which reportedly costs millions a month to maintain \) afloat following news about twitters decision to close the service , there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing vines remains but its most likely too late to salvage the community there in its earlier days , snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange the app had an incredible series on city life that gave users direct windows into different worlds people submitted short video diaries about life in their cities , which the company compiled into a single video , viewable by anyone using the app i remember feeling delighted watching people in istanbul and so paulo showing off their routines and customs but the company is now prioritizing live stories , which feature more mainstream events like the super bowl and music festivals the effect is still fascinating , but less intimate snapchat seems to be betting that people are more interested in the familiar the future of tumblr , the blogging platform whose endless warren of rabbit holes about gender theory , critical feminist thought and identity politics is unlike any other on the internet , is the most uncertain yahoo , its parent company , succumbed to financial struggles and has announced plans to be acquired by verizon , raising questions about the future of its properties what were seeing with snapchat , tumblr and vine reflects a larger shift in the social media economy user generated content , by and large , is not lucrative at a scale that satisfies investors , and as a result , most social media companies are changing direction toward other revenue streams one of the more significant shifts is the move into social messaging semiprivate messaging applications group text threads and applications like whatsapp \( which is owned by facebook \) and slack have grown in popularity as people move away from public arenas for conversation , a shift caused in part by spikes in unchecked harassment on major social networks new features are introduced daily , it seems , to make messaging with your friends more fun the latest version of the iphones software includes the ability to make messages explode with confetti whatsapp now offers the ability to tag people in messages , as you might tag them in a photograph online these changes have probably been spurred by messaging applications overseas , which used similar features to attract and retain customers \( line , a japanese company that built an addictive messaging app with 220 million monthly users worldwide , had one of the biggest initial public offerings 1 1 billion earlier this year \) these new messaging features work to bind private groups tighter together , by making it more fun to talk to one another than to engage with the world at large what happens when we would rather look inward \? i have found something of an answer in a short story called the great silence , by ted chiang , about humankinds search for signs of alien life the story is narrated by a parrot in arecibo , puerto rico , home to one of the largest radio telescopes in the world their desire to make a connection is so strong that theyve created an ear capable of hearing across the universe , the creature begins but i and my fellow parrots are right here why arent they interested in listening to our voices \? the paradox is not to be missed we are more interested in locating alien species than understanding the humanity among the species we already live with the story ends on a somber note human activity has brought my kind to the brink of extinction , the narrator explains they didnt do it maliciously they just werent paying attention chiangs lesson hits hard in this new political and cultural moment social media seemed to promise a way to better connect with people instead it seems to have made it easier to tune out the people we dont agree with but if we cant pay attention to one another , we might as well not live on the same planet at all
in 2005 , tim obrien , then a financial reporter at the new york times , published the book trumpnation the art of being the donald o'brien talked to sources with an up close view of donald j trumps finances , who concluded that the real estate developers net worth was 150 million to 250 million , rather than the 2 billion to 5 billion trump had variously claimed trump , who had courted obrien by taking him for rides in his ferrari and private jet , sued obrien for libel in new jersey in 2006 trump called obrien a wack job on the today show while , obrien says , continuing to curry favor with him privately obriens publisher , warner books , was also named in the suit and hired top lawyers who put trump through an unsparing two day deposition asked about his finances , trump was caught lying or exaggerating 30 times he thought hed get a friendly judge , and we would roll over , says obrien , who is now the executive editor of bloomberg view we didnt the case went through four judges and was dismissed in 2009 trumps suit against obrien is one of seven forays president elect trump and his companies have made as libel plaintiffs he won only once , when a defendant failed to appear but the standard measure defending his reputation and achieving victory in court isnt how trump says he thinks about his investment i spent a couple of bucks on legal fees , and they spent a whole lot more , he told the washington post in march about the hefty sum he spent on the case against obrien i did it to make his life miserable , which im happy about trump was wrong warner books spent less than he did , and obrien paid nothing but that doesnt make trumps central idea any less jarring that libel law can be a tool of revenge its disconcerting for a superrich \( if maybe not as rich as he says \) plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics once installed in the white house , trump will have a wider array of tools at his disposal , and his record suggests that , more than his predecessors , he will try to use the press and also control and subdue it as a candidate , trump blustered vaguely that he wanted to open up our libel laws i asked his spokeswoman , hope hicks , by email what he meant by that , but she didnt answer the question \( or others i posed \) its not within the presidents direct powers to change the rules for libel suits but our legal safeguards for writers and publishers arent foolproof in the last few years , trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press the members of this club are innovators they have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy but an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like obrien or even destroy entire media outlets this kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the press , which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection only 40 percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the 1990s trusts the media to report the news fully , accurately and fairly , according to a gallup survey conducted in september 2015 this mistrust has been growing for a long time , but it was stoked by trump during the campaign he called the reporters who covered him scum and whipped up yelling and booing crowds there is no consensus among his supporters that the press should hold those in power accountable a recent pew survey found that only half of trump backers agreed that it was important in a strong democracy that news organizations are free to criticize political leaders media outlets have won many cases by persuading a judge to dismiss them but since 2010 , they have succeeded in only 39 percent of the libel and privacy suits that have gone to trial , a dip from 52 percent in the previous decade , according to the media law resource center the median damage award has increased fivefold since the 1980s , to 1 1 million the figure includes three big verdicts over the last eight months , against gawker , rolling stone and the news observer in raleigh , n c these include run of the mill libel suits , and its too early to say that the sky is falling on the press but its darkening the high bar for winning a libel case in the united states was set in 1964 , when the supreme court decided new york times v sullivan in that case , widely hailed as one of the courts strongest stands for free speech , l b sullivan , a city commissioner who supervised the police in montgomery , ala , sued the times over an ad in the newspaper signed by 100 civil rights supporters the ad turned out to include minor factual errors sullivan said its depiction of how the montgomery police responded to civil rights protests made him look bad under the rules at the time , a libel plaintiff was entitled to victory if he could show that the content that harmed his reputation was false the alabama jury agreed with sullivan on that point and awarded him 500 , 000 in damages \( the equivalent of about 4 million today \) with similar cases pending , the times pulled its reporters out of alabama but when the newspaper appealed to the supreme court , the justices threw out the sullivan verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel the court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was published with actual malice , translated as knowing or reckless disregard for the truth by the 1980s , the number of libel suits decreased , and if suits did go to trial , they frequently ended in defeat for the plaintiff in two examples from that era , gen william westmoreland sued cbs , and ariel sharon , the israeli defense minister , sued time magazine neither man won damages those outcomes , as well as losses in other high profile cases , were a major deterrent for plaintiffs and their lawyers , says george freeman , executive director of the media resource law center \( and formerly a lawyer for the new york times \) superrich plaintiffs , however , arent subject to the same market forces they can treat suing the press as an investment , with the payoff being , at a minimum , the expense and time required for the other side to produce documents and sit for depositions in february 2012 , the magazine mother jones published a story about the idaho billionaire frank vandersloot , a major donor to a super pac that supported the republican presidential candidate , mitt romney in 1999 , in response to a documentary , he sponsored billboards that asked , should public television promote the homosexual lifestyle to your children \? the magazine wrote that vandersloot outed a gay reporter , peter zuckerman , and bashed zuckerman and his reporting after he helped break a story in 2005 about a history of pedophilia by a boy scouts camp counselor in idaho falls the portrayal of vandersloot was based partly on several ads that he placed in the idaho falls post register vandersloot was upset at the storys implications for the boy scouts , and the ads called zuckerman a homosexual and attacked him for having a personal ax to grind vandersloot sued mother jones for libel over the article they wanted to give me a public beating because i made a sizable donation to mitt romney , he told me vandersloot , who owns an online health shopping club , also said the mother jones article cost him customers over three years of proceedings , which included turning over internal emails , mother jones racked up about 2 5 million in legal fees insurance didnt cover the whole cost the suit was a huge drain on us , clara jeffery , editor in chief of the magazine , told me were still digging our way out judge darla williamson finally threw out vandersloots suit in october 2015 , finding that mother joness statements about him were either substantially true or opinions protected by the first amendment but williamson took the unusual step of including a section in her opinion partially supporting his underlying complaint , accusing the magazine of mudslinging rather than recognizing its approach as squarely within the tradition of investigative journalism despite his defeat , vandersloot declared himself absolutely vindicated and announced that he was creating a guardian of true liberty fund to aid other people who want to sue the liberal press the fund has grown to between 1 million and 2 million , he told me , with five times that amount pledged , so that as soon as something hits we think is worth it , we can go after it it was another billionaire , peter thiel , who realized the full potential of bankrolling other peoples lawsuits thiel , an influential figure in silicon valley who was a founder of paypal and sits on the board of facebook , is now an adviser to donald trump thiel and other silicon valley executives were regular targets of gawkers aggressive reporting and mockery in 2007 , the site ran an article titled peter thiel is totally gay , people thiel didnt sue on his own behalf but he secretly paid a hollywood lawyer , charles harder , at least 10 million to sue gawker on behalf of a suite of plaintiffs neither thiel or harder will say how many suits thiel funded , but harder has filed at least five against the website and its writers and editors \( he also represents melania trump in a 150 million suit in the united states against the british tabloid the daily mail and a maryland blogger for calling her an escort \) when thiels role was revealed by forbes magazine , thiel said his goal was less about revenge and more about specific deterrence asked in october about his secrecy , thiel said , transparency would have turned it into this very different narrative that its this billionaire trying to squash the first amendment \( he declined to comment for this article \) last march , while thiels role remained hidden , one of the suits he funded went to trial in florida the plaintiff , the aging wrestler entertainer hulk hogan , sued gawker for violating his privacy by publishing a brief video clip in october 2012 that showed him having sex hogan , whose real name is terry g bollea , testified that he was emotionally devastated yet when he learned of the existence of the sex tape seven months earlier , hogan appeared on tmz live , joking about having sex with several brunettes its common for judges to dismiss privacy suits when the plaintiff has encouraged news interest in a preliminary ruling before trial , the florida court of appeals said that gawker posted the sex tape as part of an ongoing public discussion , citing hogans appearance on tmz and later on the howard stern show but judge pamela campbell , who presided over the trial , instructed the jury to decide for itself whether the publication of the sex tape was highly offensive to a reasonable person and not of legitimate concern to the public the jury seemed to channel the publics low regard for the press when they awarded hogan 140 million in damages it just wasnt about punishment of these individuals and gawker , one juror told abc after the trial you had to do it enough where it makes an example in society and other media organizations within two months , gawkers parent company declared bankruptcy gawker was sold and ceased publication in the half century since new york times v sullivan , the united states has often held itself up to the world as a beacon for the free press american libel law , the theory goes , protects writers and publishers better than the laws of countries like britain , where its easier to win a libel judgment yet giant jury awards dont topple publications in the united kingdom the country has an unofficial damages cap of about 250 , 000 \( plus legal fees \) british publishers can , in essence , treat compensating someone whose reputation they have harmed as a cost of doing business and its less risky for them to apologize for a story that turns out to be wrong there are limits on damages for malpractice suits against doctors , says robert post , dean of the yale law school why not for journalists \? its tempting to treat gawkers demise as unique or deserved but thats a false form of reassurance , a former editor of the site , tom scocca , argued in august every publication is prepared to absorb the damage when it makes a mistake , he wrote on gawker what thiels covert campaign against gawker did was to invisibly change the terms of the risk calculation the lesson , scocca told his readers , is that you live in a country where a billionaire can put a publication out of business whats new here are two forces squeezing journalism like pincers the first is a figure like thiel , willing to place bets on lawsuit after lawsuit until he hits on a winning combination of facts , judge and jury the second is the publics animosity toward the press , now fueled by the soon to be president juries tend to reflect public sentiment and have recently penalized not just an irreverent new media site like gawker , but also a newspaper doing investigative work in september , the news observer , which is more than 100 years old , went to trial over a libel claim brought by a former state ballistics agent in north carolina , who sued regarding two articles from 2010 that included suspicions , by independent firearms experts , that she had falsified evidence to help prosecutors win a murder trial the agent said that the suspicions were untrue and that she was effectively being accused of a crime the news observer stands by its reporting but the jury found against the paper and ordered it to pay about 9 million the amount exceeded the states cap on damages and is likely to be lowered to 6 million the news observer plans to appeal in the week before the election , seth stevenson , a writer for slate , followed the trump campaign , which meant sitting in the pen where reporters were confined at rallies he realized that the pens function was to turn the press into a prop behold , he imagined trump saying to his fans ive rounded up a passel of those elites you detest and ive caged them for you ! trump has continued to treat the press as a prop , or a punching bag , since his election the weekend after his victory , he railed against the new york times on twitter for its poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the trump phenomena trump thrives on media attention , but its also clear that as the press sinks in the publics estimation , any tough coverage of him will come to seem less credible the media also serves as an all purpose receptacle for blame asked on 60 minutes why african americans , immigrants and muslims have expressed fear of his presidency , trump didnt reckon with any of his own statements he said , i think its built up by the press whatever trumps feelings about the media , new york times v sullivan will surely survive his presidency the case is revered , and in the last several years , the supreme court has moved to expand , not contract , the reach of the first amendment and states have taken steps , too to prevent people from using the courts , and the discovery process , to silence or retaliate against their critics , 28 states and the district of columbia have enacted anti slapp laws the acronym stands for strategic lawsuit against public participation its possible , however , that trump could appoint judges who would find a way around the usual press protections more immediately , he could ask his justice department to prosecute journalists who report leaks from his administration \( president obamas justice department investigated reporters , but didnt charge them \) its also possible that the press will be a meeker watchdog because of subtler changes that are harder to track as the head of the executive branch , the president exerts a great deal of control over access to information federal agencies have power to shape the state of the union they also describe it for us by producing reams of facts and statistics , which in turn shape our assessment of our elected leaders trump could hire people who cancel funding for government reports or research that doesnt serve his interests , or who suppress findings the administration doesnt like the new president will be a man who constantly accuses the media of getting things wrong but routinely misrepresents and twists facts himself their single goal will be to burnish their reputation , tim obrien predicts of the trump administration there are signs , too , of new efforts to harness the law to the cause of cowing the press trumps choice for chief adviser , stephen bannon , ran the alt right breitbart news network before joining trumps campaign last summer breitbart announced last week that it was preparing a multimillion dollar lawsuit against a major media company for calling breitbart a white nationalist website even if breitbart is bluffing , the threat will discourage other news outlets from using that term to describe it , and that will in turn help breitbart and bannon seem more acceptable to the mainstream trump was right about one thing you dont have to win every case to advance in the larger legal war
bangalore , india when sushma sonty wanted to buy herself some jewelry for her birthday , she didnt head to a traditional jeweler , as is the custom in india , or even to a local store instead , she turned to melorra , a new website that marries western fast fashion trends with wearable fine jewelry it was the first time i was buying semiprecious jewelry online , and i took a risk , said ms sonty , 32 , a human resources manager but it exceeded my expectations she bought a pair of 18 karat rose gold earrings for the equivalent of about 200 , not an insignificant sum in a country where the average online monthly spend is about 9 , 400 rupees , or 140 melorras designs are international and sophisticated , like something someone in london or new york would wear , ms sonty said , adding , you dont see these designs in indian jewelry stores jewelry is an integral part of indian culture , but most makers here design for big occasions , producing traditional pieces with significant price tags based on gold and gemstone weights that focus has continued even though the nation is modernizing at a rapid clip , and so are womens wardrobes , with urban indian women preferring western ready to wear or casual indian wear as their daily attire ornate indian style precious jewelry doesnt suit such clothes , so many either gravitate toward costume jewelry or do without jewelry altogether young women today are not like their grandmothers sitting at home , wearing a lot of traditional jewelry , said saroja yeramilli , melorras founder , in an interview at the company offices in bangalore there are now generations of indian women whose dressing sense has changed , whose lifestyle has changed , whose needs are different , and jewelry is no longer playing a role in their lives except on their wedding day ms yeramilli , 45 , wants to bring jewelry back into focus for these women by developing melorra , which started in may , into a kind of zara of the jewelry industry she sees it as blending technology , fashion and affordable prices with pieces introduced on a weekly basis and she is betting that jewelry will continue to be big business in india , which is one of the worlds top gold importers and has annual sales of 60 billion bandana tewari , fashion features director at vogue india , wrote in an email , melorra is capturing the needs of , and the spirit of a young generation of women who buy jewelry because they enjoy wearing it in their daily lives a big mind shift from the older generation who buy valuable and traditional investment pieces \( usually for weddings \) , that are promptly stored in bank lockers this buy now , wear now phenomena , she continued , could very well reflect the live for the moment philosophy that is the hallmark of gen next although a first time entrepreneur , ms yeramilli has significant experience in the jewelry business , including directing the entry of the well known indian brand tanishq into the united states she is particularly passionate about serving what she believes is a neglected indian market urban women 25 to 45 years old who spend part of their disposable incomes on themselves the companys major investor echoes the idea this is a company that caters to women , created by a woman , when the majority of online shopping sites today are designed for men by men , said sid talwar , co founder of the mumbai venture capital fund lightbox , which invested 5 million in melorra based solely on ms yeramillis business plan it was lightboxs first foray into the jewelry industry a visitor to the melorra site ms yeramilli says melorra means forever young in norse mythology is presented with designs grouped into collections for work , party or casual wear and suggestions for style trends such as crop tops , folk flowers and pleats prices range from 3 , 500 rupees to 150 , 000 rupees for delicate chains , hoop earrings , stackable rings and modular pieces melorra sources precious and semiprecious gemstones from jaipur and mumbai and uses 18 karat gold , a lighter and less expensive departure from the 22 karat weight favored for traditional indian jewelry each diamond order comes with certification from an independent agency , and gold is hallmarked ms yeramilli has 10 in house designers , primarily in bangalore , new york and birmingham , england , who use computer assisted design to render drawings that are sent to 3 d printing and manufacturing centers in the cities the companys head of sourcing and manufacturing , kathrin schoenke , is a german who was global head of manufacturing at de beers and previously worked at tiffanys and cartier the company operates on a zero inventory model , and it now takes about 10 days from online purchase to delivery , but the goal is to reduce the time to five days unlike most indian jewelers , the company offers a 30 day money back guarantee and a lifetime exchange of any piece for 90 percent of its original value melorra said that in its first four months of business , 35 percent of the sales were from repeat customers , something it had not expected so soon as for expansion , it hopes to ship to international markets , including the united states , britain and singapore , by early next year i want women to buy jewelry the way they buy handbags and shoes , ms yeramilli said with melorra , i am making a bet that if we make fine jewelry so affordable and accessible , people will come back to us again and again

washington the islamic state has used chemical weapons , including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents , at least 52 times on the battlefield in syria and iraq since it swept to power in 2014 , according to a new independent analysis more than one third of those chemical attacks have come in and around mosul , the islamic state stronghold in northern iraq , according to the assessment by the ihs conflict monitor , a london based intelligence collection and analysis service the ihs conclusions , which are based on local news reports , social media and islamic state propaganda , mark the broadest compilation of chemical attacks in the conflict american and iraqi military officials have expressed growing alarm over the prospect of additional chemical attacks as the allies press to regain both mosul and raqqa , the islamic state capital in syria the coalition is concerned about isils use of chemical weapons , col john dorrian , a military spokesman in iraq , said in an email on monday , using another name for the islamic state isil has used them in iraq and syria in the past , and we expect them to continue employing these types of weapons colonel dorrian said that the islamic states ability to use chemical weapons is rudimentary , and that american , iraqi and other allied troops are equipped to deal with the impact of these chemical attacks typically rockets , mortar shells or artillery shells filled with chemical agents the effects of these chemical munitions thus far have been limited to the immediate area where they land the ihs assessment is to be made public on tuesday the new york times obtained an advance copy of the assessment and the location of the 52 reported chemical attacks the analysis did not break down the cases by type of chemical attack in an effort to blunt the islamic states ability to make the weapons , the american led air campaign has bombed militants associated with overseeing their production and the facilities where chemical ordnance is manufactured in september , for instance , allied warplanes attacked a converted pharmaceutical factory in northern iraq thought to have been a chemical weapons production facility as iraqi forces now advance into mosul , analysts warned that the islamic state could unleash more chemical attacks as they cede control iraqi forces have reclaimed about one third of mosul , iraqs second largest city as the islamic state loses ground around mosul , there is a high risk of the group using chemical weapons to slow down and demoralize advancing enemy forces said columb strack , a senior analyst and the head of the ihs conflict monitor and to potentially make an example of and take revenge on civilian dissidents within the city at least 19 of the 52 chemical attacks have taken place in and around mosul , according to the ihs data , but the assessment noted a decline in attacks before the iraqi led offensive against the city mosul was at the center of the islamic states chemical weapons production , mr strack said but most of the equipment and experts were probably evacuated to syria in the weeks and months leading up to the mosul offensive , along with convoys of other senior members and their families the islamic state is not the only actor in syria to carry out chemical weapons strikes the syrian government has conducted many more such attacks syrian military helicopters dropped bombs containing chlorine on civilians in at least two attacks over the past two years , a special joint investigation of the united nations and an international chemical weapons monitor said in august beginning last year , american officials confirmed the first instances of the islamic state using sulfur mustard , a chemical warfare agent , and the presence of the mustard gas on fragments of ordnance used in attacks by the group in syria and iraq laboratory tests , which were also performed on scraps of clothing from victims , showed the presence of a partly degraded form of distilled sulfur mustard , an internationally banned substance that burns a victims skin , breathing passages and eyes chemical warfare agents , broadly condemned and banned by most nations under international convention , are indiscriminate they are also difficult to defend against without specialized equipment , which many of the islamic states foes in iraq and syria lack the chemical agents are worrisome as potential terrorist weapons , even though chlorine and blister agents are typically less lethal than bullets , shrapnel or explosives it was unclear how the islamic state had obtained sulfur mustard , a banned substance with a narrow chemical warfare application both the former hussein government in iraq and the current government in syria at one point possessed chemical warfare programs chlorine is commercially available as an industrial chemical and has been used occasionally by bomb makers from sunni militant groups in iraq for about a decade but it is not known how the islamic state would have obtained sulfur mustard , the officials said abandoned and aging chemical munitions produced by iraq during its war against iran in the 1980s were used in roadside bombs against american forces during the occupation that followed the 2003 american invasion of iraq but american officials have said the types of ordnance that have been publicly disclosed so far have not matched known chemical ordnance in the former iraqi inventory the attacks have been geographically scattered and have varied in their delivery systems , suggesting that the islamic state had access to , and was experimenting with , different types of rockets and shells configured to carry chemical warfare agents or toxic industrial chemicals one theory is that the militants were manufacturing a crude mustard agent themselves , american officials say another theory is that the islamic state acquired sulfur mustard from undeclared stocks in syria , either through capture or by purchasing it from corrupt officials , although this theory is not widely held by american analysts
valeant pharmaceuticals international is a onetime wall street darling that has become a punching bag for how pharmaceutical firms drove up drug prices and engaged in questionable sales practices , in the process losing 90 percent of its market value the first case to emerge from multiple federal and state investigations of its conduct , however , portrays it as a victim , not a perpetrator the justice department charged a former valeant executive , gary tanner , with taking about 9 7 million in kickbacks from andrew davenport , the chief executive of philidor rx services , a specialty mail order pharmacy , while hiding his true intentions from corporate management valeant had a relationship with philidor and in december 2014 paid 100 million on an option to buy it , but it dropped the association last year philidor shut down in january the criminal complaint depicts surreptitious payments and a cavalier attitude , highlighted by an email from mr davenport to mr tanner evoking how the two men would be like butch cassidy and the sundance kid and ride into the sunset \( or off the cliff as in the flick \) the case appears to be a straightforward tale of avarice , but there may be more to proving the charges than meets the eye , perhaps portending a more difficult prosecution for the justice department was valeant really the victim , or was it a willing participant that wanted to build up philidor so it could increase sales of its products \? mr tanners lawyer issued a statement asserting that his client did his job exceptionally well , greatly benefiting valeants shareholders , and regularly communicated to his superiors what he was doing mr davenports lawyer took a similar approach , claiming that philidor also benefited valeant , which is why valeant and its highly sophisticated and active management team sought to buy it mr tanners job was to develop what was called the alternative fulfillment program , in which valeant sought to have prescriptions filled with the companys drugs through specialty pharmacies like philidor rather than with cheaper generics in that regard , mr tanner was successful , and philidor helped the company increase its sales but valeants executives also wanted to develop other outlets for its products , which mr tanner is accused of resisting the criminal complaint portrays mr tanner as a classic unfaithful servant who made philidor a key outlet for valeants drugs while working out a secret agreement with mr davenport to get a cut of his profits he is accused of pushing valeant to enter into an option agreement to acquire the mail order pharmacy while denying to his superiors that he had any financial interest in philidor mr tanner received about 9 7 million of valeants payments to mr davenport , money funneled through corporate bank accounts to a shell company controlled by mr tanner if they were trying to hide those transfers , the two defendants certainly did a poor job by using an account over which mr tanner had signature authority , which would be easy to trace , and keeping the money in the united states rather than shifting it to an offshore account at one time , the justice department could bring a case against an employee for breaching a fiduciary duty to the employer as mail or wire fraud for violating the right of honest services statute but the supreme courts decision in skilling v united states in 2010 restricted this type of fraud to cases involving payment of a bribe or kickback to the defendant , not just unethical conduct that deceived an employer figuring out whether the 9 7 million constituted a kickback to mr tanner is the prerequisite to proving that he committed honest services fraud a federal statute cited in the skilling case defines a kickback as a benefit given to improperly obtain or reward favorable treatment in connection with a transaction whether the dealings with philidor were improper will be the crux of the governments case against the defendants the criminal complaint goes to great lengths to describe how mr tanner kept senior valeant executives in the dark about his role at philidor and the benefits he would receive he also made sure that philidor played a crucial role in the companys alternative fulfillment program by never pursuing relationships with other potential pharmacy partners buying philidor turned out to be problematic for valeant when the company had to issue an accounting restatement after finding that it had incorrectly recorded 58 million in sales to the pharmacy and after questions were raised about whether it properly disclosed the relationship with philidor in its filings with the securities and exchange commission , valeant shut down the unit but that does not necessarily mean that the philidor relationship was improper , or that the 9 7 million mr tanner received constituted an illegal kickback valeant was aware of how the mail order pharmacy operated , and the role it played in growing pharmaceutical sales , a key to wall streets embrace of the company that took the stock to more than 260 per share in 2015 the new york times described an analysts view that valeant benefited significantly from its ties to the pharmacy , allowing it to increase sales of ailing products and obscure more significant problems with the business unlike the typical kickback scheme in which a supplier pays an official to award a contract that should not have been given , the defendants can argue that the development of philidor was a benefit to valeant , and the option to buy it was arranged by experienced executives who paid no more than what they thought the mail order pharmacy was worth at the time a decision in april 2016 by the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit in chicago in united states v weimert may offer a path for mr tanner to argue that not revealing his interest in the philidor deal does not constitute fraud in that case , the conviction of a bank officer who negotiated a sale of the banks interest in a development while secretly taking an ownership interest in the property was overturned the appeals court found that negotiating parties , and certainly the sophisticated businessmen in this case , do not expect complete candor about negotiating positions , as distinct from facts and promises of future behavior mr tanners stake in the philidor deal may not have tainted the transaction even if he breached a fiduciary duty to valeant by not disclosing any arrangement he had with mr davenport unlike the typical kickback , he can argue that his share of the deal was a means to bring both sides together in a mutually beneficial arrangement thus , valeant was not so much a victim of a bad deal as a willing participant that received the benefit that it sought by gaining control of an important conduit to sell its drugs and avoid losing sales to lower cost generics that argument would not put a seal of approval on what mr tanner did , and arranging to make almost 10 million off a deal without first disclosing it to your employer is likely to be considered a breach of duty if valeant sued him but whether the federal fraud statutes should be used to police a dispute about a private employment relationship is a different question , especially when the defendants face a potential sentence of up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the fraud charge
william trevor , whose mournful , sometimes darkly funny short stories and novels about the small struggles of unremarkable people placed him in the company of masters like v s pritchett , w somerset maugham and chekhov , died on sunday in somerset , england he was 88 his death was confirmed by his son patrick cox mr trevor , who was irish by birth and upbringing but a longtime resident of britain , placed his fiction squarely in the middle of ordinary life his plots often unfolded in irish or english villages whose inhabitants , most of them hanging on to the bottom rung of the lower middle class , waged unequal battle with capricious fate in the ballroom of romance , one of his most famous stories , a young woman caring for her crippled father looks for love in a dance hall but settles , week after week , for a few drunken kisses from a local bachelor the hero of the day we got drunk on cake repeatedly phones a young woman he admires in between drinking sessions at a series of pubs the relationship deepens and , during a final call in the wee hours , takes a sudden , unexpected turn the emotional weather in mr trevors world is generally overcast , with a threat of rain i am a 58 year old provincial , the narrator of the novel nights at the alexandra \( 1987 \) begins i have no children i have never married from this bleak premise , a mesmerizing tale unfolds im very interested in the sadness of fate , the things that just happen to people , mr trevor told publishers weekly in 1983 his cast of characters , nearly all of the middling sort , was extraordinarily varied trevor has fashioned a remarkable gallery of contemporary figures , the critic ted solotaroff wrote of beyond the pale and other stories in the new york times in 1982 his farmers and priests and men of the turf are as convincing and suggestive as his hempstead aesthetes , his suburban swingers , his old boy homosexuals , his mod clerks and shopgirls nothing seems alien to him he captures the moral atmosphere of a sleek advertising agency , of a shabby west end dance hall , of a minor public school , of a shotgun wedding in an irish pub although he wrote nearly 20 novels , many of which won top literary prizes , mr trevor did his finest work in short bursts , and tended to be dismissive of his ventures into the longer form im a short story writer who writes novels when he cant get them into short stories , he once said on another occasion , his called his novels a lot of linked up short stories his fiction could be wry , satirical , boisterously comic , lugubrious or pathetic he delved deeply into the hearts of his struggling characters , whose limitations , frustrated ambitions and self delusions evoked an authorial sympathy that became more pronounced over the years as with chekhov , the comic brio of the early stories mellowed with time , giving way to a more muted , sorrowful tone , although , like chekhov , mr trevor achieved some of his finest effects by blending comedy and tragedy robert cooper , a producer who adapted several of mr trevors stories for radio and television in britain , wrote in an email in 2009 , i shall always imagine him , diffident and comfortable in tweeds , arriving in a tranquil , well ordered and beautiful place full of nice looking people , and thinking , this looks lovely i bet it isnt his language was precise , his narratives marvels of condensation in an interview with the paris review in 1989 , he defined the short story as the art of the glimpse he continued it be an explosion of truth its strength lies in what it leaves out just as much as what it puts in , if not more william trevor cox was born in ireland on may 24 , 1928 , in mitchelstown , county cork , to protestant parents his father , james , was a bank manager who took his wife , the former gertrude davison , and children from one town to another , as promotions and transfers arose an outsider by family circumstance and religion in a predominantly roman catholic country , mr trevor learned at an early age to observe quietly from the sidelines , a skill that served him well as an irish writer describing the british , and as an expatriate looking across the irish sea to the towns and villages of his youth i was fortunate that my accident of birth placed me on the edge of things , he wrote in the guardian in 1992 after graduating from trinity college , dublin , in 1950 , he taught at a preparatory school in northern ireland in 1952 , he married jane ryan , whom he had met at trinity she and their son patrick survive him , as do another son , dominic cox , and a granddaughter in secondary school , mr trevor had begun sculpting in wood , and his growing proficiency led to a job in england teaching art at schools in rugby and taunton as he developed a sideline carving statues for churches he began showing in exhibitions and , working in wood , terra cotta and metal , he embraced abstraction in 1958 , he published a wispy comedy of manners , a standard of behavior \( 1958 \) , which he later disowned he also dropped his last name , to avoid confusion with his identity as a sculptor , although that chapter in his life was already drawing to a close his abstract work , he later said , dissatisfied him because of its remoteness from human beings i sometimes think all the people who were missing in my sculpture gushed out into the stories , he told the times in 1990 to bring in income , he began working as a copywriter at notleys , a leading advertising agency in london , where , he once said , he failed to produce a single usable line of copy the job left him plenty of spare time , which he used to write fiction he grabbed the attention of critics in 1964 with the old boys , a blackly humorous account of former schoolmates who resume their old rivalries when they gather for a reunion evelyn waugh called the novel uncommonly well written , gruesome , funny and inspired , and it won the hawthornden prize as a writer , mr trevor was on his way , and notleys lost one of the least promising copywriters it had ever hired for the next half century , most of it spent in the devon countryside he most recently lived near shobrooke mr trevor turned out stories , novels and plays at a steady rate , developing an expanding world that readers came to recognize as trevor territory , and a galaxy of characters that included the village sociopath of the novel the children of dynmouth \( 1976 \) , the fabulously boring raymond bamber in the short story raymond bamber and mrs fitch , and many variations on vacillating , timorous prufrock man i dont think there is another writer from ireland with his range , gregory a schirmer , the author of william trevor a study of his fiction \( 1990 \) , said in an interview with total conviction he has written about the rural irish on their farms , about provincial towns , about commercial dublin , about middle class protestants and the remnants of the aristocracy he offers a complete picture of life on that island in 1982 , mr trevor told the new yorker , which published many of his stories each character is somebody that i know very well as well as i know myself you become very interested in that person you become immensely inquisitive and immensely curious he added , im sort of a predator , an invader of people the settings changed most of the early novels and stories take place in english villages on his attraction to england as a subject , he told publishers weekly , i knew just enough about it to be fascinated as ireland became more remote to him , he found it more congenial as a subject observed most closely from a distance although he often turned back the clock , writing about the ireland of 50 or 100 years ago , but with a keen historical eye for the signs of sectarian conflict that would explode later the novel fools of fortune \( 1983 \) , which opens in 1918 , develops into a parable of the troubles , and there are , inevitably , historical foreshadowings in the novels other peoples worlds \( 1980 \) , the silence in the garden \( 1996 \) and the story of lucy gault \( 2002 \) , which begin at the close of the first world war and the early years of irish independence , and even in the news from ireland , one of mr trevors most celebrated later stories , set during the famine years of the 1840s i have no messages or anything like that , mr trevor told the paris review i have no philosophy and i dont impose on my characters anything more than the predicament they find themselves in
when robert eidelbergs journalism class at john bowne high school in flushing , queens , convened in september , 1972 , our first assignment was to write an obituary about ourselves we were all about 15 years old , without much life experience \( i was months from my first paying job at a supermarket \) , so the task was to invent our futures did you keep mine \? i asked mr eidelberg last week soon after i announced my move to the obits staff after 25 years in sports didnt \? he responded , with a laugh , prompting me to wish that i could read how i had lived and what i had died of eidelberg is the one teacher ive stayed in touch with all these years he inspired me to enter journalism and each time ive made a significant change in my career , ive called him forty four years later , he is teaching at hunter college and retains the big hearted enthusiasm he brought to our class he recalled that he asked us to write our obituaries as a way to understand ourselves and test our imaginations it was the biographical version of `how i spent my summer vacation , he said but i wouldnt have gotten so much interesting content if i hadnt framed it as an obituary of yourself id like to think i awarded myself a pulitzer now , i will be writing obituaries of others , which ive done now and then while covering sports media and business ive written nearly three dozen obits , all of sports personalities , including the announcers mel allen , ernie harwell , jim mckay , phil rizzuto and harry caray each was , in that ghoulish way that obit writers feel , a pleasure to write \( especially for someone who enjoyed watching sports more than playing them and spent many hours professionally writing about sportscasters \) some years ago , i wrote an advance obit of vin scully , the great brooklyn and los angeles dodgers annnouncer who retired last month after 67 years at the microphone as i wrote about his unmatched career , i couldnt help but think of what i might be adding to the article as i observed scullys gracious farewell to fans as he approaches his 89th birthday would it be that he recorded wind beneath my wings for his wife as a christmas gift \? or his revelation that he would resume rooting for the giants , the dodgers arch rival and the team he grew up loving when he , and the giants , were new yorkers \? the occasional obit that fit into my sports department schedule was a diversion , not a full time endeavor the news of my departure for the dead zone generated three distinct reactions from friends , colleagues and people i write about the first was congratulations the second involved fond memories of the obits i have written and the third was something a lot like dont call me for a while thats right people who recently lobbied me to write about them , now hoped i would lose their phone numbers until they die a well known local sportscaster summed things up nicely when he said , in an email , i always looked forward to you writing a long feature on me in the paper of record now i can wait a loooong time in fact , lets skip it completely the most unusual reaction came from a famous and sophisticated former sports commissioner will you interview me for my advance obit \? he asked teeming with apparent awareness that his years as a successful commissioner entitled him to an advance obit and that , at age 70 something , he was overdue for one bill mcdonald , the obituaries editor , believes that this is the first offer by a big newsmaker to volunteer to talk to us for an article that he will never read we more frequently hear from second string types , he told me , looking for posthumous glory
ten days removed from the still fresh shock of donald trumps election , around lunchtime on a friday , i navigated the jagged lines of steel barriers , police officers and secret service battalions with big dogs and big guns surrounding trump tower the glass and marble shopping mall , tourist trap and tv set had been transformed into the unlikely plotting ground for the nations immediate future it was anybodys guess what was taking shape inside the gilded bunkers clots of media people , passers by and protesters crowded the lobby and nearby streets for the occasional clue , or at least glimpses of marla maples and prime minister shinzo abe of japan kellyanne conway posed for a selfie with a few lucky cops the locus of the scene was a bank of elevators ferrying staff , cabinet candidates and the competing maestros of the trump transition to and from various nerve centers over several floors every time a bell sounded , announcing the opening of an elevator door , lobby heads would bob expectantly is that what jeff sessions looks like \? i heard a photographer ask \( no , it is not , and it was not \) no doubt a host of key trump orchestrators and luminary actors were making ample use of auxiliary entrances and exits , sneaking in and out new rumors , predictions and potential firestorms seemed to materialize every hour the kremlinology of the incoming white house is shaping up as knotty , to say the least not one of trumps initial high level hires has any experience working in a white house how will they work with the volatile real estate and reality show maven in the oval office \? with his proclivity to make decisions based on the last person he speaks to \? with his children playing an uncertain role , his son in law a possibly ever present whisperer \? how will it all work with trumps senior adviser steve bannon , former head of breitbart news , who has a long rap sheet of racial , ethnic and sexist affronts and a long running war on washington republicans \? i had gone to trump tower to see reince priebus , the republican national committee chairman , whom trump named as his chief of staff five days after his election , in the same release in which bannon was named chief strategist and senior counselor bannon was mentioned first , for kremlinologists scoring at home , and his appointment has consumed the bulk of the attention , given his hyperprovocative ways but priebus , in a sense , filled a more exotic role he would be the chief establishment ambassador for a president whose brief and meteoric political career has been predicated on blowing that establishment up a generous reading is that trump is trying to foster a yin yang tension between his top deputies , who will represent his own diametrically opposed impulses \( bannon the bomb throwing devil on one shoulder , priebus the peacemaking angel on the other \) the simpler reading is that trump hasnt thought that much about this and is simply trying to reward and surround himself with people he feels served him well in the campaign its almost like a puzzle mystery , priebus told me last summer i dont recall what we were talking about , but priebus had a knack for homespun wisconsin logic and , particularly , throwaway lines that would stick with me i kept thinking of the puzzle mysteries that were playing out up and down trump tower , even though i showed up friday without an appointment with priebus and was confined to the lobby watching tourists ride up and down its now famous escalators priebus and i started talking last spring , as i was undertaking an article for this magazine about the seemingly fracturing state of the republican party we kept in touch during the campaign , drank the occasional miller high life in his office and exchanged the sporadic email priebus was constantly going on tv saying he was certain trump would win , even though he could read polls and precedents like everyone else still , he carried on as the chief carrier of trumps choppy water because thats what a party chairman does he smiles and spins and swallows his best laid plans and audibles in the name of getting his nominee to the finish line in a sense , priebus , who squired his future wife to a local g o p banquet on their first date , was the purest form of political hack that trump would rail against as he bulldozed the g o p for his efforts during the campaign , priebus gained the respect and gratitude of trump loyalists especially the fiercest loyalist , donald j trump himself he also won derision and ridicule he was the subject of multiple stories in the onion \( reince priebus smiles , shakes head while flipping through old briefing on g o p s plans for 2016 \) his spirited tv defenses of trumps indefensible behavior drew him comparisons to baghdad bob \( muhammad said al sahhaf \) , saddam husseins chief propagandist during the early months of the iraq war , whose dubious predictions of imminent victory despite growing devastation all around made him an international laughingstock long before trumps victory , back when it seemed like a long shot , i asked priebus whether he would consider taking a job in a trump administration maybe a plum ambassadorship to somewhere yes , he said wisconsin it was a throwaway answer to a throwaway question , which was laughably hypothetical anyway but i never had a sense he had thought that much about a trump administration job , besides possibly staying on as r n c chairman whether or not the donald prevailed for all his well honed sheepishness , priebuss just a kid from kenosha , wisc shtick belies a penchant for main stages , big ticket rooms and high level company no shortage of reince priebus photos hang on the walls of the r n c s headquarters on capitol hill he can be a little star struck he travels far and often to appear with candidates and party dignitaries at events where his presence is not necessarily required priebus was giddy when i spoke to him last spring as he prepared to attend a party for times 100 most influential people at lincoln center we were on the phone , him walking through the lobby of the j w marriott after a packed day of fund raising he sounded almost out of breath , less from exhaustion than what seemed like pure excitement he told me how stoked he was to meet the golfer jordan spieth and the pro wrestler turned actor the rock those are my top two , priebus said , especially the rock i was a big pro wrestling fan back in the day , he added , noting his childhood admiration for hulk hogan and mad dog vachon growing up in kenosha , wisc , being named to the top 100 list is a pretty cool thing , priebus told me at this point , i reminded him that no national party chairman would ever be named to the top 100 except in extraordinary circumstances like these and these were not particularly enviable ones the white house chief of staffs post is arguably the most grueling job in washington it would be a burnout caldron under even the most predictable and disciplined of presidents the average tenure of a white house chief of staff is about two years chief of staff jobs are so synonymous with thanklessness that a whole white house mythology surrounds them a good chief of staff is seldom popular , richard nixon wrote in his 1990 memoir he must see that his chief gets the credit for the administrations successes and must take the heat for its failures , even when they are not his fault he sometimes finds he doesnt have many friends or supporters some may well call him just a prat boy some may call priebus worse than that , and maybe already have eat rocks is an expression ive heard priebus use a few times it refers to being game to do what is needed swallowing pride and taking one \( or one thousand \) for the team if serving as r n c chairman in 2016 has been the definition of eating rocks , priebuss next gig could go down even harder its 24 7 and never stops , says andy card of the job he held in george w bushs white house for more than five years , making him the second longest serving chief of staff in history my only area of angst on priebus is that he has young children , card added , referring to priebuss son and daughter card has a few other concerns , one of which he says presented itself as soon as trump jumped all over megyn kelly in the first republican primary debate last year im thinking he would be a very hard president to work for if he doesnt accept people speaking candidly to him card , who remains close to the bush family and supported jeb bush for president , said the most important part of being a chief of staff is remembering that the staff part is far more important than the chief part the president is by far his most important client i know of one chief of staff who failed because he was used to being a principal , says beth myers , who served as mitt romneys chief of staff during his four years as governor of massachusetts priebus may not have that problem he has been described with that most anodyne term for a washington manager , the consensus builder but the white house chief of staff job is not so much about building consensus , card told me its all about serving the only principal who matters chief of staff is the only job in washington that really is defined by what the presidents idiosyncrasies are , card says are they a morning person or an evening person \? disciplined or not \? do they suffer fools kindly or not \? priebus and the future president elect had their dicey stretches , but their relationship grew as the campaign wore on trump told me over and over again , i trust reince , i trust him , priebus felt a need to tell me one day in his office last spring they have both proved a lot of people wrong and were both aggressively underestimated along the way , if not outright dismissed i dont buy this theory that unpredictable is necessarily bad , priebus said back when trump was just his ruffian nominee and not yet his future boss you cant appreciate the magnitude of priebuss changing loyalties until you consider just how much time , energy and dignity he expended before nov 8 trying to protect the party from being defiled by trump donald trump is donald trump , and the party is the party , priebus used to tell me during the campaign his ultimate allegiance was never in question it was only six years ago that priebus was happily ensconced in kenosha as chairman of the republican party of wisconsin now he is being described as the consummate washington insider in the trump white house he certainly has a line to republican officials , namely his close friend and fellow wisconsinite paul ryan but in the end , for priebus , its now all about serving trump , whose partisan impulses have proved flexible through the years let alone his allegiance to the g o p he ran , foremost , as a candidate of disruption he fashioned himself a dealmaker no doubt this could immediately run afoul of the conservative orthodoxy that has driven the republican agenda on capitol hill trump also vowed to drain the swamp of the bloodsucker lobbyists and blood money fund raisers , political hacks and various other parasites and hangers on that have fattened themselves so spectacularly in suck up city in many ways , these are priebuss people he has cavorted , fund raised and campaigned with them for years , attended their crack of dawn donors breakfasts and mediated their disputes he will most likely be looked upon as a chief emissary to the capitol hill , k street and donor constituencies that trump explicitly campaigned against the chief of swamp for his part , bannon has undertaken an incendiary mission over the years to upend the g o p establishment , no one more so than ryan \( a total and complete sellout of the american people , breitbart once declared , referring to ryans stewardship of house appropriations \) bannon could occupy something of a mysterious svengali role in the tradition of presumed all powerful presidential whisperers like karl rove \( for george w bush \) and valerie jarrett \( for barack obama \) both rove and jarrett represented wild cards in their respective white houses and regular thorns in the sides of the various chiefs of staffs with whom they served but one notable difference is that neither rove nor jarrett made it his or her goal to obliterate the establishments that their presidents were trying to fold themselves into nor did either have close ties to fringe elements of their parties , as bannon has to the so called alt right and its main platform breitbart has been described as a white ethno nationalist propaganda mill by the southern poverty law center the site has posted articles linking undocumented immigrants to disease , declared in a headline that birth control makes women unattractive and crazy , promoted the confederate flag \( hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage \) and referred to gabby giffords as the gun control movements human shield bannon , who has tried to play down the most extreme elements of the alt right in recent days , nonetheless viewed trump as a kindred provocateur a feeling that appears mutual in one form or another , priebus will try to integrate his establishment orientations with these disruptive forces operating all around him back during the campaign , priebus used to refer admiringly to trump as an earthquake in a box in a separate conversation \( and metaphor \) , he described his challenge to me as keeping trump inside the funnel presumably this meant keeping him directed and contained , easier said than done , but still fascinating and somewhat entertaining to watch unfold in the campaign but with the presence of bannon and the weight of trump leading a nervous and divided nation , the challenge in the white house is considerably less entertaining to contemplate washington like the presidency , certainly creates its own distinct funnel that will shape trump and everyone around him in inexplicable and perhaps dark ways as it turned out , priebus never showed his face in the lobby of trumps building , at least when i was there like many key players inside trumps ragtag circle of collaborators , priebus has gone largely dark since election day , holing up in transition tower with occasional hops down to washington he was not responding to my emails and was described by gatekeepers as drinking from multiple fire hoses so for now , my most recent and enduring image of priebus is watching him beaming and red faced and a bit stunned on tv in the early hours of nov 9 a triumphant trump had just called him to the podium , declared him a superstar and compared him to secretariat but ill tell you , reince is really a star , trump exulted reince , come up here where is reince \? get over here , reince trump offered him the mike and insisted he say something there could be no more of a pinnacle moment for an avowed republican party animal who used to listen to newt gingrich speeches in the car as a teenager he would soon go from being one of the most dumped on figures in american politics to one of the most sucked up to insiders in a white house of insurgents ladies and gentleman , the next president of the united states , donald trump , was all priebus could muster there were worse images to dwell on before the drama intensified and puzzle mysteries inevitably presented themselves who knew what the nights result would lead to or what normal would

aman was on a train in japan , reading a novel set in japan the train slid past the mountains , bound for kyoto , where the man , bearded , bright eyed , was headed the year was 1989 the train was a bullet train the man on the train was in a quandary , and the man in the novel he was reading was in a quandary and as he read the novel , it emerged that his quandary and the one in the novel were essentially the same the man in the novel was sebastian rodrigues , a portuguese jesuit priest sent to japan in the 17th century he was there to minister to japanese catholics suffering under a brutal regime and also to find out what had happened to his mentor , a priest rumored to have renounced the faith under torture the man on the train was martin scorsese he was in japan to play the part of vincent van gogh in a movie by akira kurosawa , another master filmmaker he was also there to move past a brutal battle in americas culture wars over a picture of his , the last temptation of christ the film had been pilloried by conservative christians for a dream sequence in which christ has sex with mary magdalene in depicting christs life as a doubt ridden struggle between his human and divine natures , scorsese had intended to make a film that was at once an act of doubt and an act of faith in the novel he was reading , the priest was shown profaning an image of christ , and yet the act was an act of faith the train slid past the mountains scorsese turned the pages this novel spoke to him all at once he saw it as a picture he would like to make the novel was silence , by shusaku endo , a japanese convert steeped in european literature and the history of catholicism in japan published in japan in 1966 , silence sold 800 , 000 copies , a huge number in that country endo was called the japanese graham greene and was considered for the nobel prize greene referred to silence as one of the finest novels of our time the jesuit missionary francis xavier brought catholicism to japan in 1549 in the next century , it was suppressed through the torture of missionaries and their followers , who were forced to apostatize by stepping on the a piece of copper impressed with an image of christ in silence , endo took the missionaries point of view , casting much of the novel in the form of letters by rodrigues reporting back to his superior he goes to japan with another young priest , francisco garrpe , vowing to seek the truth about their mentor , father cristvo ferreira , but they are captured and shown the dogma defying reality of human suffering under torture the shogunate invites the japanese converts to avoid torture by stepping on the many do some are tortured anyway rodrigues sees converts crucified , burned alive , drowned a magistrate fluent in christianity makes a grim proposal rodrigues can save the lives of the converts under torture if only he will step on the and apostatize when scorsese returned from japan , he procured the film rights to silence as the years passed , hardly a day went by without his mentioning the project to the people around him actors , friends and even his old parish priest , father principe as he made the aviator and the departed , shutter island and hugo , he insisted that silence was the picture he really wanted to make a jesuit was elected pope islamic terrorists began targeting christians in the middle east in 2014 , with the wolf of wall street a hit , scorsese declared that silence would be his next picture he wouldnt commit to another until it was finished twenty six years in , filming began what led this great american artist to make a story of missionaries in japan his ultimate passion project \? he is known for his gangster pictures he is a grandmaster of the profane from the beginning , he has revealed himself to be an artist of intensely catholic preoccupations , and the poisoned arrow of religious conflict runs straight through his career taxi driver a vietnam vet as a spiritual avenger , bent on cleansing the city of filth through violence cape fear a tattooed fundamentalist determined to exact gods justice kundun a young man raised to be a spiritual master , thrust up against spirit killing communism even living in the material world , scorseses documentary about george harrison , takes as its theme the conflict between flesh and spirit , between beatle and seeker silence is a novel for our time it locates , in the missionary past , so many of the religious matters that vex us in the postsecular present the claims to universal truths in diverse societies , the conflict between a profession of faith and the expression of it , and the seeming silence of god while believers are drawn into violence on his behalf as material for scorsese , then , silence is apt , and yet scorseses commitment to it has been extraordinary , even by his exacting standards to understand that commitment , i spoke with the filmmaker , with members of the cast and the production team and with others who know the novel well trying to grasp just what kind of an act of faith this film is i dont know if theres redemption , but there is such a thing as trying to get it right , scorsese said to me , in the ungentrified new york voice familiar from the cameos in his movies but how do you do it \? the right way to live has to do with selflessness i believe that but how does one act that out \? i dont think you practice it consciously it has to be something that develops in you maybe through a lot of mistakes he had invited me to his east side townhouse at 9 p m , having spent a full day editing silence in midtown the living room , high ceilinged , oak paneled , is decorated with a vintage movie camera , billboard size posters for jean renoirs the grand illusion and photographs of his wife and daughter he is 74 , compact and gray , with tremendous life in his eyes and a youthful ardor that seems to have its source in reverence for his elders like the polish filmmaker andrzej wajda , who had signed a storyboard that scorsese unhooked from the wall to show me we took seats , and he began to talk as the hours passed , the room , already dark , seemed to diminish around us , until it resembled a screening room , or a chapel , a place where questions of how to live are posed through stories and images it goes back to what father principe was telling me the last time i saw him , a couple of years ago , he said failing , doing something that is morally reprehensible , that is a great sin well , many people will never come back from that but the christian way would be to get up and try again maybe not consciously , but you get yourself into a situation where you can make another choice and thats the situation rodrigues is in he can choose to save the lives of others by renouncing his faith , the act he considers most reprehensible of all silence , no less than scorseses informal new york trilogy mean streets , taxi driver , raging bull is rooted in his childhood as a boy in little italy , he wanted to be a missionary his parents were not religious , in part because their parents had felt the churchs heavy hand in sicily , but for him the church a malign force in so many coming of age stories was a portal to the world beyond family and neighborhood i trusted the church , because it made sense , what they preached , what they taught , he said i understood that theres another way to think , outside the closed , hidden , frightened , tough world i grew up in the movies , likewise , pointed to the wider world his father , a presser in the garment district , didnt make much but always had enough money to take him to the movies a local tv station broadcast italian films on friday nights he grew up watching the crucial works of italian neorealism , many of them with a strong catholic dimension like roberto rossellinis rome , open city , in which a priest is executed for cooperating with the resistance the italian american catholicism of the area was centered on street processions devoted to saints brought over from the old country san gandolfo for the sicilians on elizabeth street , san gennaro for the neapolitans on mulberry street when i was there , it was already dying out , scorsese told me it hooked him even so the vast , vaulted interior of st patricks old cathedral on mott street was a sharp contrast to the familys small apartment , the latin mass a formal counterpoint to their mealtime banter i think fast , i move fast , and i think it has something to do with the medication i was given for asthma , scorsese said it affected the way i breathe , the way i think i needed to pull back film did that for me , and so did the church they slowed me down they allowed me to meditate they gave me a different sense of time francis principe , a young priest assigned to the neighborhood , brought faith and film together he was the one who opened up things for us , scorsese recalled who said you dont have to live this way you dont have to follow in this cultural cycle you dont have to get married at 21 scorsese had become an altar boy , and each year principe would take the altar boys to a movie uptown around the world in 80 days , the bridge on the river kwai and sit talking about it with them afterward on the steps of the rectory on mulberry street they went to the roxy near times square to see the gospel drama the robe and then heard him put it down father principe detested christian sentimentality or comic book religious aspects , scorsese said oh , its so clich , he said , meaning the thunder when judas mentions his name , and theres the thunder in stereophonic sound to this day i havent heard thunder as good as that and yet at age 11 he conceived of the wish to do it differently , to take the biblical epic to another place faith and film offset the asthma that kept him out of sports and off the streets indoors , he drew movie storyboards , including some , a few years later , for a life of christ i set it right in the neighborhood , he told me , with the crucifixion taking place on the west side piers and the n y p d involved can you see it \? indoors , he had a front row seat for adult matters , especially his fathers dealings with a spendthrift uncle who seemed to take money from his father freely and with impunity to pay the loan shark it was a pattern he knew from the scripture passages read in church my brothers keeper its my brothers keeper ! he said , chortling with recognition and it goes beyond your brother are we responsible for other people \? what is our obligation , when somebody does something that is so upsetting \? do you really have to do it because theyre a brother , or youre related , or you made vows of marriage \? what is the right thing to do for the other person , and for yourself \? all of this carried through i would see it acted out one way in reality , and i would hear it another way from father principe and a couple of priests at cardinal hayes cardinal hayes is a high school in the bronx , and after a year of minor seminary a tryout for the priesthood once a regular stop for bright catholic boys of limited means scorsese went there \( don delillo , the novelist , was a few years ahead \) rejected by fordham university because of poor grades , scorsese enrolled at n y u s washington square college and its film program from there , he plunged into the 60s a concertgoer at the fillmore east , an expatriate in england and holland , an assistant director at woodstock \( he became an editor on the concert film \) and then a maker of his own movies whos that knocking at my door , about a young man in the suddenly liberated 60s whose catholic principles keep him out of bed with his girlfriend , and boxcar bertha , a film about a female rabble rouser freeer than most when he returned to little italy in 1972 to make mean streets , some of the young men in his generation were stepping into the underworld roles their fathers had occupied early in the picture , charlie , an entry level mobster played by harvey keitel , talks about going to confession in the old cathedral he wishes he could choose his own penance instead of having one assigned by the priest he gets his wish , in a way it falls to him to look out for johnny boy , played by robert de niro the lost boy of the neighborhood , a reckless gambler who puts them both in danger charlie becomes his brothers keeper and charlie , eager to rise in the mob , lets his friend dangle without reaching out to the powerful uncle who could save him pauline kael , in the new yorker , struck a biblical note charlie talks a lot to johnny boy about friendship and does nothing hes judas the betrayer it is striking to see the brothers keeper pattern show up at the other end of scorseses career , in silence as the two jesuits set out for japan , they find a translator named kichijiro in a seedy neighborhood and drag him into their mission he resists he drinks himself sick he lies he bemoans his fate a convert , he apostatized and was allowed to live , while the shogunate killed his brothers and sisters rodrigues decides that he is kichijiros keeper and grimly bears up as kichijiro apostatizes again and again and finally betrays him to the shogunate but as rodrigues is racked by doubts , the peasant becomes the priests keeper , a man whose faith is rooted in his recognition of his own weakness who is more christlike the person who is strong in faith or the one who is weak , who is humiliated \? humiliation thats the key , scorsese told me as kichijiro says in the movie where is the place for a weak person in the world were in \? why wasnt i born when there wasnt any persecution \? i would have been a great christian for half a century , scorsese has been a missionary for the cinema making his own movies , promoting the work of great international directors , consolidating the history of the medium in a brilliant group of documentaries and advocating for the preservation of classics over time , this picture of his about a missionary adventure became a mission in its own right , and the act of getting it made became an act of faith i knew he had this script and was terribly disappointed that he couldnt get it made , irwin winkler , who produced raging bull and goodfellas , told me and i thought , what a sad state hollywood is in when martin scorsese , with all his success , with all the honors hes gotten , cant get a movie made there began an intense collective effort guided by emma tillinger koskoff , the films producer , to make the project materialize winkler worked through dozens of legal disputes attached to the project randall emmett , a producer , secured new funding , and in 2013 scorsese and some associates went to cannes and returned with 21 million in distribution commitments i dont think hed ever done that before , koskoff told me , but for this picture he has done a lot of things he hadnt done before he would direct the picture without a fee all the principal actors andrew garfield , adam driver , liam neeson have action movie pedigrees but would work for screen actors guild scale or for greatly reduced fees \( a pittance , neeson called it , uncomplainingly \) paramount pictures signed on as the u s distributor in 2014 koskoff and the production designer dante ferretti scouted locations in vancouver , montreal , the pacific northwest and new zealand after four trips to taiwan , they decided that taiwan it would be for eight months in all , 750 people , cast and crew and production team , would put their faith in scorseses act of faith silence is a novel about the necessity of belief fighting the voice of experience , as scorsese has put it to get the jesuits beliefs right , he engaged the rev james martin , an author and editor at large of the jesuit weekly america filmmaker and priest had several colloquies at scorseses home , and martin worked intensively with garfield and driver just as de niro learned to box for raging bull , they familiarized themselves with the rites and disciplines of the jesuit priesthood to bring authenticity to their performances garfield , known for his role in two spider man movies , prepared to play father rodrigues by entering fully into the process that jesuits call spiritual direction raised outside london , with a secular jewish father , garfield developed his character by undergoing the spiritual exercises of st ignatius of loyola , the founder of the jesuit order the exercises , devised in the 1520s , invite the exercitant to use his imagination to place himself in the company of jesus , at the foot of the cross , among tormented souls in hell garfield met with martin for spiritual direction , and they swapped reflections via email and skype then he set out for st beunos , a jesuit house in wales , to undertake a seven day silent retreat if id had 10 years , it wouldnt have been enough to prepare for this role , garfield told me i got totally swept up in all things jesuit and very taken with jesuit spirituality the preparation went on for nearly a year , and by the time we got to taiwan , it was bursting out of me its not unusual for performers to allude vaguely to their spirituality but garfield describes the process with guileless specificity on retreat , you enter into your imagination to accompany jesus through his life from his conception to his crucifixion and resurrection you are walking , talking , praying with jesus , suffering with him and its devastating to see someone who has been your friend , whom you love , be so brutalized before garfield left for taiwan , martin gave him a cross he had received as a gift while a jesuit novice andrew got to the point where he could out jesuit a jesuit , martin told me there were places in the script where he would stop and say , a jesuit wouldnt say that , and we would come up with something else i dont think i am called to be a priest , garfield said to me resolutely , as if making this film had spurred him to consider the prospect but i had the feeling that i was being called to something called to work with one of the great directors , and called to this role as something i had to pursue for my spiritual development driver has played the unreliable boyfriend in girls and the villainous kylo ren in star wars the force awakens to play francisco garrupe \( garrpe in the novel \) , rodriguess slightly more skeptical companion , driver , who was raised a baptist in indiana , worked by analogy this movie is the story of a crisis of faith , he said , and explained that he tried to apply the ideas of faith and doubt generally it could be faith in your work , in the project or in a marriage it could be doubts about the work or the project or the marriage when you think about it that way , its very relatable so he related to faith and doubt and he lost nearly a third of his weight for the role fifty one pounds , he told me over black coffee its about control , and as an actor you want to have control but its also about suffering it gives you information you can use in the role he lost the weight over four and a half months , supervised by a nutrition coach early on , he spent a week at st beunos garfield was already two days into his retreat when driver arrived at the place , a victorian gothic pile where the jesuit poet gerard manley hopkins was once in residence pledged to silence , the two actors waved when they spied each other in the refectory liam neeson , raised catholic in ireland , brought to silence the insights he gained during the mission , roland joffs 1986 film about jesuit adventures in south america daniel berrigan , the jesuit poet and pacifist , was an adviser to that picture and celebrated mass with the actors neeson , de niro , jeremy irons on location in colombia neeson told me i remember father dan saying , do you know that stanislavski based his exercises for actors on the spiritual exercises of st ignatius \? id come all this way to hear that ! that had a real effect on me this time , in taiwan to play father ferreira the older jesuit who apostatized after being tortured neeson underwent a simulacrum of the torture , suspended upside down by ropes over a pit of excreta the japanese actor yoshi oida , determined to do his best to play a character crucified in the sea , hung on a cross as a wave machine pushed rising tides of water over him oida was 82 by the time driver filmed his final scene in which garrupe , long unseen , staggers into view , starved by his captors he was hallucinating from hunger i did the scene and hopped on a plane to new york to do a table reading for girls , he told me , and then began a regimen of triple breakfasts at a diner in brooklyn a o scott , now a chief film critic for the new york times , once wrote that scorsese approaches filmmaking as a priestly avocation , a set of spiritual exercises embedded in technical problems so it was with silence marty insists on having silence on the set , garfield told me the silence says something is happening here scorsese arranged the shooting script chronologically , so the cast could feel the characters emotions in sequence finally garfield reached the scene in which rodrigues steps on the , profaning the god he believes in and renouncing the faith he has come halfway across the world to preach actor and director prepared the shot a bare foot pressed to a piece of copper , the face of christ worn smooth by the feet of countless apostates before him its something we had both waited for , garfield said , but marty had waited much longer he had waited decades to film that scene the director was ready the priest stepped and then there was a technical difficulty i almost lost my mind , and i think marty did , too , garfield recalled he wanted it to be done in one take there was a second take , and the priest profaned the image of christ once and for all step by step , silence got made the picture scorsese saw in his head on the bullet train took 27 years and 46 5 million to realize all in gods good time , he said to me philosophically as we sat together in his house in the near dark it was one oclock in the morning we dont know why , but this is how this picture got made it had to be this way scorsese could speak philosophically , because he had been through all this before a passion project , religious in nature , based on a novel delays , funding difficulties and reluctance among studio executives such was the last temptation of christ , his adaptation of the novel by nikos kazantzakis when the novel was published in athens in 1955 , its conceit that jesus felt a temptation to climb down from the cross and live an earthly life with mary magdalene was seen as a challenge to conservative christianity , represented by the greek orthodox church by the time it reached the united states in english translation , the 60s were on , and the novel was taken up by the counterculture as a template for religious illumination through carnal knowledge scorsese read the novel in the 70s after it was given to him by barbara hershey and david carradine , the two stars of boxcar bertha by the time he set to making a movie adaptation , it was the reagan era , and the novel was again seen as a challenge to conservative christianity , then at full volume scorseses stated aims for the picture were straightforward he wanted to give the gospel story a contemporary accent , the way great artists like caravaggio had done and he wanted to fulfill his childhood vision and take the biblical epic to a different place but the project soon turned complicated beyond belief after committing to the picture in 1983 , paramount pictures began to have doubts scorsese shrank the shooting schedule \( planned for israel \) and the budget , agreeing to forgo his fee as fundamentalist christian leaders got wind of the project , they organized a hostile letter writing campaign against paramounts parent company , gulf and western salah hassanein , the head of united artists , then the second largest movie theater chain , declared that u a wouldnt show the picture on its screens , citing trouble with the life of brian and other christian themed films , as well as with a film called mohammed messenger of god that had prompted bomb threats in an agonizing meeting with scorsese and studio executives , paramounts chief , barry diller , canceled the picture by now scorseses intentions for it were a good deal more complicated i told him that god cant be only in the hands of the churches , he later said , recalling the meeting with hassanein there are so many obstacles in between us and the spirit in a sense , to make this film was to try to make god accessible to people in the audience who feel alienated from the churches i said i have had three divorces does this mean i cant speak to god because the church says i cant \? no , no ! i can talk for myself because im me angry and restive , he took on two projects initiated by others after hours , set in lower manhattan , and the color of money , a pool hall drama starring paul newman and tom cruise the color of money grossed 52 million the biggest hit hed ever had emboldened , he switched agents to newmans agent , michael ovitz , the head of creative artists agency mike said what is it you want to get done \? what is the film you really want to get made \? i said , the last temptation of christ and he said , o k and i said , ive heard that before ovitz swiftly got last temptation greenlighted at universal scorsese filmed in morocco with willem dafoe as jesus , harvey keitel as judas , david bowie as pontius pilate and barbara hershey as mary magdalene what happened next still stands as a central episode in the culture wars as scorsese worked round the clock to edit the picture , the religious right moved against it donald wildmon , a right wing instigator and head of the american family association , organized a picketing campaign at universal pictures in los angeles the rev r l hymers jr of the baptist tabernacle of los angeles did the same outside the home of lew wasserman , the chairman of mca , which owned universal the leader of the campus crusade for christ , bill bright , offered to buy the film from universal in order to destroy it universal moved up the films release date and took out full page newspaper ads in its support in an interview with reporters in rome , the italian director franco zeffirelli , who hadnt seen the movie , called it truly horrible and completely deranged reports attributed to him a remark that the movie was the product of hollywoods jewish scum zeffirelli denied this , but the notion took root that the movie was the sinister work of a cabal of jewish movie executives conspiring against the christian faith the day the film had its premiere at the ziegfeld aug 12 , 1988 hundreds of picketers were there so were several television news crews after the premiere , scorsese recalled to me , a group of us went to dinner at the regency hotel the group included universal executives the celebrated director michael powell scorseses longtime editor and collaborator , thelma schoonmaker and prominent christians who had supported the movie paul moore , the episcopal bishop of new york , had written a letter to the new york times declaring that the movie dramatized the core church teaching that jesus is both fully human and fully divine at the regency , moore told scorsese about a book he should read the next day he had it sent over silence , by shusaku endo in egypt , syria , pakistan , china , and elsewhere , the persecution of christians often to the point of martyrdom is real and continuing since the sept 11 attacks , the word martyr has taken on awful new connotations silence , then , is inadvertently topical like the novel , the picture interrogates the very idea of christian martyrdom , by proposing that there are instances when martyrdom the believer holding fast to christ to the bitter end is not holy or even right it makes in the way of art the arguments made in defense of last temptation that an act cant be fully understood if the intentions behind it arent taken into account , and that a seeming act of profanation can be an act of devotion if done out of an underlying faith at a dramatic moment in the novel , rodrigues hears the cries of christians who are being tortured outside his cell he has been told that he can save their lives if he will step on the he agonizes he prays he feels the offer as a temptation weary , hungry , surrounded by suffering and death , he hears a voice he takes to be jesus trample ! it was to be trampled on by men that i was born into this world the novel poses a very profound theological question , peter c phan , a catholic theologian at georgetown who was born in vietnam , told me the question is this are we allowed to do an essentially evil act to obtain a good result \? if it is done to save himself , then the answer is no but the novel is so complex because he does it for his followers , for the good end of saving his flock he will go to hell but he will go to hell for their sake rodrigues tramples on the because his intention is right to save the lives of others the act seems right and because it entails the sacrifice of his exalted sense of himself , it seems a christian act , a loss of self for others sake the novel doesnt work through theological questions so scholastically rather , it enfolds them within other questions whether missionary activity is ipso facto a form of imperialism , and whether the content of a religious faith is lost in translation when it is promulgated in a new language in a new land should the church adapt to particular cultures , or should it maintain an approach distinctively its own \? in christian theology , that is a question of inculturation since the council of jerusalem when the apostles , jews by birth , clashed over whether new christians should be held to jewish law the history of christianity has turned on questions of inculturation the brilliance of silence is that it shows how these questions increase and multiply the young jesuits seem to favor inculturation , adopting peasant dress , taking the sacraments directly to the people and calling their hut the monastery a magistrate a figure akin to dostoyevskys grand inquisitor tells rodrigues that christianity cannot take root in the swamp that is japan when rodrigues finally meets him , ferreira concurs the converts \? they are breakaway buddhists , the apostate priest says they worship the sun of god , not the son of god those martyrs , dying upside down in the pit \? they didnt die for christ , he tells rodrigues , they died for you for all that , silence is itself a complex act of inculturation a novel , featuring a european priests point of view , that could not have been written by anyone but a japanese the , too , is an expression of inculturation , a point developed in a new book by the artist makoto fujimura it is an image of god devised by the shogunate for the purpose of abuse , but over the course of the novel , it becomes an authentic image of christ under threat , the converts abuse it they renounce their faith but that doesnt mean they stop believing they keep hidden faith in mysterious ways scorseses own body of work is a strong argument for inculturation , in that he instinctively finds religious patterns and images in modern , urban , vulgar , dispirited society his silence is an act of cultural adaptation \( some would call it appropriation \) to the third degree here an italian american catholic adapts a japanese catholics novel about portuguese catholics for a hollywood movie arguably american cultures most distinctive art form and yet scorseses silence suggests that inculturation of the usual kind is impossible instead , it makes vivid the idea that the act called apostasy can be a shrewd adaptation of religious faith to a hostile culture , and that faith maintained in spite of a believers outward acts of apostasy is faith nonetheless the question the novel comes down to , then , is this are you a christian \? this question , posed by garrpe to the peasant kichijiro , is one that rodrigues must answer for himself before he approaches the , and long after he tramples on it it is a question that cannot be answered for the would be believer by the church , or a mentor , or society the novel is not about a missionarys struggle with a hostile culture when the magistrate says as much , rodrigues denies it no , no unconsciously the priest raised his voice as he spoke my struggle was with christianity in my own heart before it opens in new york and los angeles in december , silence will be screened in rome for several hundred jesuits and for cinephiles at the vatican its no stretch to suppose that pope francis , a jesuit himself , will find a way to be there scorsese assuredly will be there , and its striking to envision him sitting in the dark with the pope as his new picture plays their boyhoods were a lot alike six years older , jorge mario bergoglio was brought up in buenos aires in a family of italian immigrants who took him to the movies often , and he grew up cherishing italian cinema , especially fellinis la strada a film about the possibility of sainthood , scorsese calls it i asked scorsese how he would describe his work to pope francis he paused , then replied , i would say that ive tried , in my work , to find out how to live life tried to explore what our existence really is and the meaning of it one day not long ago , scorsese stepped out of a black car in front of the old cathedral he had on an overcoat , a scarf and a broad brimmed hat he tightened the scarf , pulled the hat low and stood near the graveyard adjoining the cathedral we used to play hide and seek right here , he said you could hide behind the gravestones you knew which ones were the right size for you little italy today is largely symbolic territory , like the vatican within italy the old ravenite social club a headquarters for the gambino crime syndicate is now a cydwoq shoe tique chinatown , once south of canal street , extends most of the way up mott street at the catholic churches , mass is offered in vietnamese and cantonese scorsese looked up mott street toward houston street where the korean restaurant is , that used to be a two family house past it was a funeral home the funeral procession would come out and bear the coffin along the sidewalk here and into the cathedral i remember two kids from the neighborhood , 16 or 17 they died of cancer , and the families had to be carried from the funeral home to the church , they were so devastated it was terrible ill never forget it inside the old cathedral , it became clear how literally scorsese has never forgotten not the splendor of the church , nor the presence of suffering and death , sin and redemption , nearby the pastor pointed out the details of a renovation the saints retouched in their original colors , the marble and brass altar fixtures restored to the way they were before a 1970 modernizing effort scorsese , who left the neighborhood in 1965 , didnt need a guide he knew every inch of the place picture an 8 year old boy standing right here in a white cassock , reciting a prayer in latin , he mused aloud thats me the closing scenes of his silence follow rodrigues through the decades after he apostatizes a priest no more , rodrigues represents the shogunate in its dealings with traders from europe what is his inner life \? what does he believe \? working from the imagination rather than from the text of the novel , scorsese found a final image , subtle but not cryptic , for the characters position and its an image that suggests the nature of scorseses own engagement with matters of faith i asked him to draw a connection between silence and what he was seeing in the old cathedral he tapped his forehead with two fingers the connection is that it has never been interrupted its continuous i never left in my mind , i am here every day
inside new york citys law department , the case is named matter no 2016 013018 it goes by an even more mysterious title in the citys 10 million contract with outside criminal defense lawyers john doe investigation but for new yorkers , the matter is better known as the federal inquiry into mayor bill de blasio , a democrat , and his aides , one that is said to focus on whether they traded

detailed look yet at the cost of defending actions that the mayor has insisted were appropriate and legal the law department , which arranged for the legal services through negotiation as opposed to a competitive bid process , described in concise terms its need for a firm with expertise in criminal defense law to provide legal services in support of the john doe investigation and any related litigation the department checked several boxes saying it required a contractor to obtain special expertise not available at the agency , provide services not needed on a long term basis , accomplish work within a limited amount of time and avoid a conflict of interest the citys corporation counsel , who oversees the department , waived a requirement for a public hearing on the contract , the documents show , on the ground that a hearing could disclose litigation strategy the de blasio administration , prompted by required budgetary reports , has in recent days offered a limited accounting of its spending on outside lawyers 6 5 million through the end of the year for overlapping investigations of the mayor , said eric f phillips , mr de blasios spokesman that amount includes 400 , 000 for lawyers at carter ledyard milburn , who have helped defend the city in state and local inquiries including one by the comptroller into the sale in february of rivington house , a former nursing home in manhattan whose deed restricted use of the property to nonprofit residential health care mr phillips declined to comment on whether the firm continued to work for the city on that matter mr de blasio , asked at a news conference on friday about the costs , said weve been asked to provide information weve been very , very cooperative , and as many times as the investigators want to talk to members of the administration , of course they will have that opportunity but each time requires preparation and representation thats why a law department spokesman declined to reply to a list of questions about the contract dan levitan , a spokesman for mr de blasios 2013 and 2017 campaigns , said the mayor and his aides acted ethically and appropriately at all times mr levitan said no public money had been spent to defend the 2013 campaign or the mayors political nonprofit , campaign for one new york , which is at the center of some of the investigations he declined to say how much non city money had been spent to defend them we hope that the investigations , which have now lasted over seven months , will draw to a close , mr levitan said in an email the contract with debevoise plimpton described as a multiyear agreement is retroactive to april 25 , several weeks after news reports surfaced that an investigation by the united states attorneys office in manhattan into corruption at the police department had spread to include fund raising by mr de blasio it is set to last through final disposition , one document says elsewhere , the end date is given as july 31 , 2020 the costs are set out in the contract and are commensurate with rates charged by other top city firms 850 an hour for work by partners , 650 an hour for counsel , 575 an hour for associates and 175 for paralegals and other staff a spokesman for the comptroller , scott m stringer , whose office approves most city contracts , declined to comment on whether the spending was appropriate or on other aspects of the contract , which is currently under review by his office of the total cost of 10 million , 2 million is for the 2016 fiscal year , with the rest to be spent in the 2017 fiscal year , the documents show a nov 14 memo from the law department included with the contract said that because of severe time constraints , the firm had commenced work before the contract was officially registered , but that it had not yet been paid matthew e fishbein , a partner at debevoise plimpton who signed the contract for the firm , declined to comment but his page on his company website says that his experience defending companies and executives includes ongoing inquiries by federal and local authorities into mayor bill de blasios campaign fund raising practices and related issues in the more than 80 pages of documents in the filing , the mayors name is not mentioned in connection with the matter and only once is the nature of the john doe investigation hinted at in a letter from the law department to mr fishbein , which describes the inquiry as being conducted by the u s attorneys office for the southern district of new york , the department of investigation and other entities the letter says the firm would represent city employees and the employees of other entities the city has agreed to represent and or defend in interviews or if subpoenaed to give grand jury testimony asked on friday if he had been interviewed by federal authorities , mr de blasio had a simple response no

the haggler loves a great consumer mystery like , why are hotel thermostats so varied and confounding \? do we really need smart refrigerators \? and heres one that recently flitted across the hagglers mind when taco bell conceived its cheesy core burrito basically , a cheese burrito stuffed inside a beef burrito did it ever consider cramming the whole concoction into yet another , even bigger burrito and calling it the triple dare \? emails to taco bell with this perfectly reasonable question were not returned some consumer mysteries have solutions some of them do not in this episode , an example of the latter q i work at a nonprofit in manhattan toward the end of may , i received a bill from a company called idc servco for 7 , 000 worth of printer toner less than a month later i received another bill for 9 , 000 worth of the same product historically we have paid 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 a year for toner , though to a different company as i later learned , we had never hired idc servco when i got the second bill , i called the company a representative was very apologetic but basically made it seem that we had , in fact , ordered 16 , 000 in toner this guy agreed to lower the price of the second shipment to 5 , 000 at the time i assumed we had a deal with this operation so i wrote a check and thought that was that but the weirdness was just starting soon after , i got a call from a man at a company id never heard of he said he worked with idc servco and would cut the cost of the second shipment to 3 , 419 if i paid his company via credit card and canceled the check for 5 , 000 to idc servco i gave him our companys credit card number , i canceled the 5 , 000 check to idc servco , and thought , once again , this is over of course , the guy from idc servco called and he asked why the 5 , 000 check had been canceled i really thought we were caught in the middle of a fight between two companies a few weeks later , a man named jim snodgrass from idc servco called me and said the people from the other company were crooks and that i needed to report fraudulent activity on my card \( haggler interruption this tale goes on and on , right through september \) it turns out that we had been sending money to idc servco as far back as 2014 in all , we spent 28 , 694 and wound up with 48 cartridges if you do the math , we paid about 10 times the price charged by amazon we used 18 cartridges id happily send back the remaining 30 for a refund can you try to arrange that deal \? susie polsky , new york a perhaps , dear reader , you are wondering why the haggler described this case as a mystery heres why idc servco really should not exist in late june , the federal bureau of investigation the united states secret service the police in huntington beach , calif and the orange county district attorneys office arrested 21 people linked to the company and charged them with operating a scheme to sell toner at inflated prices the toner swindle has been around for years , and idc servco sounds like a classic example inflated prices were just part of it prosecutors said idc servco would pose as the regular toner suppliers of its victims , which turned out to be a very effective sales strategy from the time it began operating in 1988 , idc servco netted about 126 million from 50 , 000 companies , the authorities said , mostly small businesses and charities so why is idc servco still , apparently , in the toner business \? what connection does this company have with the one that prompted the arrests \? the haggler called jim snodgrass ms polsky had his number and he sounded like a perfectly reasonable guy he offered to answer questions via email unfortunately , neither the haggler nor ms polsky could fully make sense of mr snodgrasss account of this 28 , 694 misadventure the clear part was that mr snodgrass thought idc servco had done all that it could to help ms polskys nonprofit organization he also said that idc servco had begun winding down operations and ceased taking new orders in june in a follow up , the haggler asked about the june arrests though mr snodgrasss name was not on the list of those arrested , an obvious question presented itself why did idc servco appear to be in business as recently as september \? i have referred this to upper management , who will refer it to the companys attorneys , he replied the next day that is the extent of the response that i can give you no lawyer from the company has contacted the haggler when the haggler suggested the swap requested by ms polsky , mr snodgrass did not reply the haggler was still left wondering about the peculiar resilience of idc servco so he contacted thom mrozek , a spokesman for the united states attorneys office for the central district of california , in los angeles in an email , mr mrozek wrote that the operator of idc servco , gil michaels , was told to shut down the company as a condition of his release on bond this summer we recently spoke with his attorneys , who informed us that the company was no longer doing business , mr mrozek continued we will look into this matter in an attempt to determine if the same company , perhaps operating under different operators , is still in business so its a mystery to the authorities , too if any answers emerge , rest assured , they will be shared right here
forty one tibetans who were detained by the nepalese police while they were on a bus bound for india have been released to a nepalese human rights group , an advocate for tibetan rights said friday the advocate , kate saunders , of the international campaign for tibet , said early friday in london that the human rights group , the human rights organization of nepal , and other contacts in kathmandu , nepals capital , had told her that immigration officials and the police had allowed all the tibetans to be released ms saunders said the tibetans were mostly from kham and amdo , tibetan regions now ruled by china , and were on a pilgrimage to sacred sites in nepal and india it is likely that they planned to go in january to an important buddhist ceremony , the kalachakra teaching , in bodh gaya , an indian city , she said it is unclear what those tibetans will do now they could end up at the kathmandu transit center of the united nations high commissioner for refugees from there , many tibetans make their way to india , against chinas wishes ms saunders said the tibetans were in a very precarious situation the human rights organization of nepal did not respond to an email asking for an update on the situation of the tibetans the dalai lama , the spiritual leader of the tibetans , is expected to teach at the kalachakra gathering from jan 3 to jan 14 he offers this teaching regularly at different places , and many tibetans try to make their way to bodh gaya , the site where the buddha attained enlightenment , when the dalai lama travels there from his home in northern india to teach in 2012 , chinese security officials detained hundreds of tibetans after they returned from the kalachakra in bodh gaya many of them were released later the chinese government opposes the dalai lama and calls him a splittist , but tibetans remain devoted to him , and many try to travel to india to see him since a widespread uprising across tibetan regions in 2008 , the chinese government has increased its security presence on the tibet nepal border and has prevented many tibetans from leaving the number of tibetans making their way to nepal has plummeted china is also exercising greater influence over nepal , and tibetans in nepal complain of more detentions there and a ban on anti china protests ms saunders said chinese officials were making great efforts to prevent tibetans from traveling to bodh gaya this year for the dalai lamas teaching what we know is that the chinese authorities have tightened controls on tibetans , in some areas going from house to house to confiscate peoples passports , she said in the last few weeks , government officials have confiscated passports in the tibetan areas of qinghai and gansu , and according to some sources , also in sichuan and the tibet autonomous region , she added some tibetans who have already arrived in nepal and india for pilgrimage and for attending the religious ceremony in bodh gaya have already been ordered to return , and their families pressured by the authorities so no doubt for this group of 41 , things will be very difficult , she said , particularly given that they will now be on the radar of the chinese authorities in nepal , given the nature of the relationship between the two governments
ang lees new film , billy lynns long halftime walk , contains sights perhaps never so vividly rendered in a movie when bullet casings fly from a machine gun , each one is clearly visible rather than appearing in a blur when billy lynn \( joe alwyn \) , a soldier on leave from iraq , tears up at the national anthem or experiences battle flashbacks during the smoke bombs of a destinys child performance , the emotions in his eyes register with uncommon clarity on the other hand , when steve martin mugs as the owner of a pro football team , his face contains a level of detail normally preferred by dermatologists these are the trade offs of working at a high frame rate , the speed at which a film is shot and , in some cases , projected the rate has a strong effect on an images sharpness mr lee shot billy lynn at 120 frames per second , far faster than 24 , the standard for about 90 years few theaters are presenting it at that rate , so most viewers are out of luck or perhaps better off , depending on your views on frame rates for some directors , like peter jackson who shot the hobbit at 48 frames per second , to largely negative reaction and james cameron , higher frame rates are the future of movies , an opportunity to correct the motion blur that afflicts fast paced action sequences shot at the standard rate introducing billy lynn at the new york film festival last month , mr lee , who won a directing oscar for his work with 3 d digital cinema on life of pi , expressed trepidation about reaction to what he called kind of an experimental movie and asked the audience to keep an open mind he had reason to worry david rooney of the hollywood reporter offered a typical reaction the film , he wrote in his review , had the somewhat distancing hyper real sharpness of many outsize high definition flat screen tvs high frame rates arent new theyre used in video games and on television and thats the problem viewers , accustomed to the softer texture of movies , see the extreme sharpness of high frame rate cinema and feel intuitively that theyve stumbled into a theatrical broadcast or a football game if you start increasing the frame rate of the movie , whether its 48 or 60 or 120 , it can tend to start looking like a television show , said douglas trumbull , a director and special effects expert who has been a pioneer in high frame rates in the 1970s , he developed the showscan process , which ran at 60 frames per second still , he said , there is no need for that association i can guarantee you that we can make a high frame rate movie that does not look like television the 24 frames per second rate , at which most movies , even digitally projected ones , are shown , was always something of an accident at the dawn of sound , when the rate was standardized , going more slowly would have muddied the audio and going faster would have exceeded the sensitivity of existing film stocks , said dean goodhill , one of the editors of the fugitive and an inventor of maxivision48 , a high frame rate process from the late 1990s that never got beyond a demonstration clip there were other experiments with frame rates in the celluloid era the todd ao process of the 1950s ran at 30 frames per second cinerama used three simultaneous projectors and ran at 26 frames per second in both cases , the higher rates were needed to accommodate outsize screens that made flicker and blur more visible tim j smith , an academic who studies visual cognition at birkbeck , university of london , said there is no scientific reason 24 frames per second should be more appealing to viewers what were coming into the cinema with is the same audiovisual sensory system we have before we go into the cinema , he said in theory , he said , the move to a higher frame rate should lead to more natural , more effortless processing by the viewers visual system acculturation may be the main reason moviegoers find the sharpness off putting its interesting that people are sensitive to it , mr smith said theyre seeing a crispness to the image , which is unfamiliar in the cinema context their main frame of reference seems to be tv or video , and kind of implied by that association is cheapness or documentary or immediacy is it good to have that \? its hard to know but the film historian david bordwell said that high frame rates have only re emerged as a solution to a problem that is specific to digital cinema , particularly murky digital 3 d , which grows less murky when frames are added he noted that at least on a normal size screen , there was never any of the dreaded stammer in the panning shots of kenji mizoguchi , max ophls or jean renoir people who doubt it should see the films \( film , not video \) to check , he wrote by email for mr trumbull , who demonstrated high frame rates for mr lee but did not take part in the production of billy lynn , the increased film speed of his showscan process was a natural outgrowth of the move toward bigger screens and bigger spectacles in the 1950s and 1960s , but a faster rate was never taken up as the industry moved toward multiplexes and tiny auditoriums he was effusive about mr lee and his willingness to experiment a wonderful , brave and courageous effort , he said but after watching the movie at the new york film festival , he wasnt pleased i was really upset when i was at the premiere of billy lynn that it was in a very narrow , small screen theater , he said he felt that it was projected with too much illumination , that it needed dark time between frames \( we dont perceive them as such , but movies are successions of still images and on most projectors , each flash is interspersed with moments of darkness \) billy lynn has almost no darkness in response , ben gervais , the films technical supervisor , said , we found that there was no real advantage in terms of the way that the movie felt with added dark time mr trumbull also said that it was crucial to present the film on a screen that filled a wider frame of vision , like imax , to show the benefits of high frame rates and to keep cinematic texture we shouldnt draw conclusions about high frame rates as a result of billy lynn being incorrectly presented , he said it would be really tragic mr trumbull has a competing high frame rate format , magi , which is different from showscan but he said magi has solved what he sees as the problems of billy lynn it may also be necessary , he added , for filmmakers to alter their approaches to suit the format he recalled his own experience working on the visual effects of 2001 a space odyssey , for which the camera motion was slowed so that the visuals would look smooth on a giant screen thats what kind of led to the style of the movie , he said like mr trumbull , mr goodhill said that it was possible to retain the cinematic texture while gaining the clarity of the higher frame rate maxivision48 lavishly praised in 1999 by roger ebert , among others looked both new and traditional at the same time , he recalled but he emphasized that he doesnt necessarily regard that texture as the right one thats up for the individual artist to decide
as questions about valeant pharmaceuticals internationals business practices have mounted over the past year , its relationship with the mail order pharmacy philidor rx services has come under the most scrutiny on thursday , the justice department said that andrew davenport , the chief executive of philidor , and gary tanner , a former executive at valeant , were at the heart of this relationship , accusing the two men of secretly agreeing to promote the pharmacys interests inside valeant , including persuading valeant to buy an option to acquire philidor the justice department charged both men with multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy the arrests are the first charges in multiple state and federal investigations into valeants business practices according to the complaint , filed wednesday in federal district court for the southern district of new york , mr davenport , who pocketed about 40 million after the purchase option agreement went through , used a series of shell companies to transfer a 10 million kickback payment to mr tanner the government said that mr tanner used an email account under the name brian wilson to secretly communicate with mr davenport in one celebratory email to that account , mr davenport wrote that he could picture the two of them on a butch and sundance ride into the sunset \( of course , the two outlaws met a nasty end \) mr tanner was forced out of valeant in 2015 mr davenport remained at philidor until the company shut down in january both men said through their lawyers that they intended to defend themselves preet bharara , the united states attorney for the southern district of new york , said at a news conference on thursday that the investigation was continuing he would not say whether his office was looking into valeants accounting practices in a statement , valeant noted that the company and its top executives had not been charged in the case , and said it was cooperating with the investigation federal prosecutors announced on thursday that jpmorgan chase and its hong kong subsidiary would pay about 264 million to settle bribery charges connected to its practice of hiring children of chinese leaders , confirming an earlier report in dealbook the authorities investigation revealed that as jpmorgan was competing with other big banks for business in china , some bankers concluded that they needed to bring on the children of well connected parents , known as princelings we lost a deal to db today because they got chairmans daughter work for them this summer , one jpmorgan investment banking executive told colleagues , referring to deutsche bank many of the job candidates were unqualified , the authorities said , but jpmorgan hired them anyway for example the son of a powerful executive who had a wharton degree was described as having a not very impressive , poor g p a and had both an attitude issue and a napping problem the son of a chinese official who did very , very poorly in his interviews still secured a position in new york only to be transferred again a jpmorgan banker later said that the hire sent out an e mail \( which he inadvertently copied to an h r person \) , where he made some inappropriate sexual remarks his peers said he was immature , irresponsible and unreliable , but he kept his job shareholders of tesla and solarcity showed their support for elon musk by approving the merger of the two companies on thursday tesla said more than 85 percent of its independent shareholders voted for the deal under the terms of the transaction , solarcity shareholders will receive 0 11 of a tesla share for each share of solarcity that they own at thursdays closing prices , that offer is worth about 20 75 a share , or just shy of where solarcity shares closed critics have argued that the deal would weigh down tesla financially shares of tesla have fallen about 14 percent since the company first disclosed its intentions in after hours trading on thursday , shares of tesla were little changed shares of solarcity rose nearly 2 percent in after hours trading several federal reserve officials are scheduled to speak today william c dudley , president of the federal reserve bank of new york , will talk about the consumer expectations survey esther l george , president of the kansas city fed , and robert s kaplan , president of the dallas fed , will attend a conference in houston on oil and the economy and charles l evans , president of the chicago fed , will give the opening remarks at a symposium on community banking

schools and support from straight celebrities have helped increase tolerance , she said among those celebrities is the pop singer a mei , who is from the aboriginal puyuma tribe in our tribe , we dont

month , a mei received the generation award for her support for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights at the inaugural queermosa awards , organized by the taiwan international queer film festival queermosas goal is to spotlight people working to make those voices heard , said the festivals director , jay lin he cited the united states as an example to emulate , noting that television there includes many characters of varying sexual orientations i really do see a lot more potential for media to have an impact , mr lin said after the queermosa awards , tv producers and film producers actually came up to me and said , o k , what can we do to have more diversity on tv and in film \? for now , mr lin said he was focused on finding out who the allies are to ensure that marriage equality became a reality if we dont capitalize on this moment , he said , i dont know when the next opportunity will be
it was a warm saturday morning in october , and on a 50 acre farm just north of bell buckle , tenn \( pop 425 \) , 46 runners gathered at the starting line , preparing to run one of the quirkiest , yet most arduous , of races called the big backyard ultra , the race required contestants to run a course that spanned 4 167 miles , over trails etched out of the farm , every hour if you finished faster than an hour , you got five or 10 minutes to rest or eat or go to the bathroom before the next round if it took you longer than an hour , you were out the race would keep going , hour after blessed hour , until there was only one runner left the reason the big backyard ultras founder , gary cantrell , had chosen 4 167 miles for his course is that if you ran 24 loops in 24 hours , youd have gone exactly 100 miles \( and the reason cantrell named it big backyard ultra was because , \( a \) big was the name of his dog , and \( b \) the farm on which the race was run was , in fact , his backyard \) virtually all the runners had ultramarathon experience andy pearson , 31 , had won a 100 miler in pine , ariz , just the month before , with a time of 23 hours 16 minutes 31 seconds babak rastgoufard , 43 , had placed third in a 100 kilometer race in friant , calif , last november one man told me he would soon be running from maine to florida another said he was using this race as preparation for a coming 100k race i had come to watch an ultramarathoner , charlie engle , whom runners world had once described as renowned at the age of 54 , engle has been running long races marathons , adventure treks and ultramarathons since his late 20s he is not a very fast runner , nor a very stylish one , but he has a skill thats much more important for the kind of race he prefers an unusual ability to fight through pain and fatigue he told me recently that the moment he craves is the moment when every fiber of his being screams quit i need that moment when i think , this sucks , is how he put it when he first started running , engle did it as a form of penance i was feeling badly about myself and wanted to punish myself , he said then , as he realized he was good at running long distances , ultramarathons and other , even more extreme events became a way to test his limits and , to some extent , build his celebrity five years ago , running took on another role in his life it helped keep him sane now , engle runs long distances not only because he loves it but because it is one thing he can do that nobody can take away from him to put it another way , running has saved his life the first time i ever spoke to engle , he was calling me from a telephone in a minimum security prison in beaver , w va this was in the spring of 2011 , three years after the financial crisis in the wake of that crisis , millions of people lost their homes because , during the bubble , they had taken on subprime mortgages they ultimately couldnt afford engle , who had gotten caught up in the housing bubble , was in prison for mortgage fraud at the time , i was writing columns in the business section of the new york times , a number of which focused on the unwillingness of the justice department to hold accountable the top executives of the companies that had led the country over the cliff , like angelo mozilo of countrywide and yet here was this smallest of small fries , who had lost two houses during the subprime crisis , sentenced to 21 months in jail for supposedly committing bank fraud the more i looked into it , the sketchier the whole situation seemed it had begun after an internal revenue service agent watched a documentary , produced by matt damon , about an expedition engle had organized , a grueling 111 day , 4 , 500 mile run across the sahara the agent started wondering how engle had time to earn a living with all the time he spent running he opened an investigation it included dumpster dives outside engles apartment that found nothing wrong with his taxes but an undercover female agent , assigned to befriend engle , got him to brag about taking a couple of liar loans while she secretly had a tape recorder rolling liar loan is the term for loans in which people overstate their incomes to qualify for mortgages they probably shouldnt have millions of people took out liar loans during the housing bubble , just as engle did thousands of brokers encouraged them to do so , just as engles broker did and as it turns out , the evidence against engle was so thin that the jury found him innocent of providing false information to the bank even as it was convicting him of bank fraud go figure the point i made in the column is that theres something wrong with a system that sends charlie engle to prison and lets angelo mozilo go free it doesnt often happen this way , but something good came out of my column it helped engle get a book contract two months ago , the book , titled running man , was published the first quarter of it tells the harrowing story of engle as a young addict who cant resist either booze or drugs , who drives away people who love him , and who has a number of close calls during late night cocaine buys and then , after a binge , he runs to purge his guilt engles first marathon takes place the morning after a cocaine binge when he finally starts taking sobriety seriously , after the birth of his first child , running marathons becomes his focus in 1996 , in australia , engle mistakenly enrolls in a 52k not seeing the 2 , he thinks it is a 5k there comes a point in the race when engle realizes that he actually craves the pain the pain told me to go on , he writes feel the pain , welcome the pain , use the pain , transcend the pain he somehow finishes the race , and his career as a long distance runner is born for the next decade plus , engle constantly tries to find ever more difficult challenges he runs in eco challenges around the globe he runs badwater , the 135 mile , death valley to mount whitney race that many consider the toughest in the world the first time he runs it , he comes in eighth he follows that with two third place finishes , and two fourth place finishes with heat that can go as high as 130 degrees and cold as low as 30 degrees , it is his favorite race in 2006 , with cameras in tow , engle runs across the sahara with two other runners two years later , engle participates in a second documentary , running across america with marshall ulrich , a renowned ultramarathoner in his own right \( the race results in a falling out between the two men \) he has sponsors he makes motivational speeches and he dabbles in real estate speculation , buying and selling a dozen homes before the bubble bursts after which , of course , it all falls apart there werent any other runners in prison , engle explains in running man , but there was a small gravel track a little at a time , engle began running on it others began to join him , mostly men who were out of shape and for whom he became an exercise coach as well it wasnt long before running became his prison therapy he got the nickname running man from his fellow inmates but he also needed a goal something not just to occupy him but to motivate him so he decided to run 135 miles , the same length as badwater , and to do it on the same day in july that badwater was being held on the west coast of course he had to prepare at one point the prison was in lockdown , and he couldnt get outdoors to do the 15 miler he had planned that day so he ran the equivalent of 15 miles in place in his cell and although it took him two days because he had to go back to his cell at night he pulled it off , running 81 miles the first day and 54 the next prison officials werent too happy about it , recalled howell weltz , a former prison inmate who befriended engle and confirmed engles account of prison life they tried to bust it up by saying he was violating the rules by not wearing a t shirt , weltz said charlie calmly walked over to where his t shirt was , put it on , and then continued running he has a lot of guts \( the warden , william vest , declined to comment on engles account of his running pursuits in prison , saying , i dont even remember him \) engles descriptions of that run the way other inmates sidled up to him to quietly root him on his dealing with prison rules during the run the sheer satisfaction and even joy he took from running 540 laps on a rutty track in a west virginia prison are the highlight of running man the book ends with engle getting out of prison , falling in love with a woman named stacey hatcher , whom he marries , and preparing to run what else \? badwater big backyard ultra is hardly badwater , but its not chopped liver , either what makes it so difficult is partly that it has no definite end it might go 20 hours , or it might go 40 second , in races of 75 or 100 miles , runners can afford to have a bad stretch , during which they will walk , down food and aspirin , and try to regather themselves in this race , a bad stretch means youre out of the race because you wont finish the loop in the allotted hour cantrell , who has organized a handful of other long races besides this one , particularly enjoyed the psychological dimension to big backyard ultra once it gets down to a handful of contenders , it becomes a mental game , he said as he stroked his long gray beard and puffed on a cigarette you dont want to show pain if you show pain , the others will try to put you out engle and hatcher had driven from durham , n c , an eight hour trip , the day before the race i met them in a hotel lobby , where engle explained how being in prison had affected his life i cant vote i cant own a house , he said yesterday , when i tried to rent a car to come here , i was turned down he sometimes gets spooked when someone knocks on the door although saucony gives him shoes , he has lost his paying sponsors he and hatcher have sometimes been turned down when theyve tried to rent a place oh , and he makes monthly payments to bank of america for the 262 , 000 the court says he owes in restitution by the time i arrived at cantrells farm , a little before the 7 a m start , engle and hatcher had set up a table filled with food \( energy bars , nuts , fig newtons \) , liquid \( coconut water , chocolate almond milk \) and supplies \( headlamp , and blister popping kit , among other things \) tents were scattered around the lawn as the runners approached the starting line they stood behind an official looking timing clock and began running when cantrell rang a cowbell i could actually hear cows in the background there were some people here who knew what had happened to engle five years earlier , but most didnt they knew him as a runner one they all respected hes an older guy , cantrell said , but hes durable and mentally tough he added , this race plays to his strengths engle once had a reputation for arrogance in the documentary running the sahara , he is shown berating his fellow runners when they want to quit the run but now , people told me , he was the friendliest and most helpful of runners weeks earlier , engle had helped prepare a young runner named pete kostelnick , who was hoping to break the record for the fastest run across america \( he did , handily \) even while engle was at big backyard ultra , kostelnicks crew checked in daily to update him and ask advice engles times during the first handful of loops were between 52 and 55 minutes he wore earphones and listened to the novel darktown as he ran he was never first , but never last either between laps , he would down some food , gulp some water , say a few words to other runners and take encouragement from his wife , who was serving as his crew by the ninth loop , the field was down to 18 runners hatcher speculated that the unseasonably warm day was taking a toll on the runners , including engle the thrill is gone , he said to her , as he tried to replenish the calories he was losing then he went to the starting line for the 10th loop by 7 a m the next morning by which time 100 miles had been run there were only four runners left , including pearson , rastgoufard and engle the younger two were running strong , sometimes finishing laps in less than 50 minutes and looking as though they could go on forever engle was hurting and seeing how easily they were running wasnt helping matters i got my wish , he said with a wry smile im suffering he added ive been struggling for a while i keep hoping something is going to change on the 27th loop , rastgoufard came in at 48 minutes , and pearson who himself was starting to struggle followed at 52 engle was nowhere to be seen finally , hatcher saw him in the woods with a minute and a half to go he crossed the finish line 30 seconds before the 28th lap was to start he turned to cantrell and said , no ms im not sure why , but i think he got dehydrated , hatcher said he had run 112 5 miles in 27 hours \( rastgoufard won the race when pearson dropped out one lap later \) after he and hatcher had returned to durham , he sent me an email it was not a great race for me , he wrote i felt lethargic from the start i dont know why there is no real way to pinpoint exactly why i feel better or worse during any given event thats part of the challenge , to keep going even when not performing at my best one thing i had pressed him on was why he enjoyed a sport that seemed so far beyond what most humans would be willing to endure hed had a hard time explaining it , beyond the idea that he liked to push through pain now , in the email , he tried again i dont run solely to suffer , he wrote i run to explore other places and also to explore myself running is a mechanism that lets me focus on one task forward movement its like removing all the clutter in the closet in order to see the actual closet space running organizes whats there and helps me get rid of things i dont need

san francisco an automated army of pro donald j trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting hillary clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election , according to a report published thursday by researchers at oxford university the chatbots basic software programs with a bit of artificial intelligence and rudimentary communication skills would send messages on twitter based on a topic , usually defined on the social network by a word preceded by a hashtag symbol , like clinton their purpose to rant , confuse people on facts , or simply muddy discussions , said philip n howard , a sociologist at the oxford internet institute and one of the authors of the report if you were looking for a real debate of the issues , you werent going to find it with a chatbot theyre yelling fools , dr howard said and a lot of what they pass around is false news the role fake news played in the presidential election has become a sore point for the technology industry , particularly google , twitter and facebook on monday , google said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service facebook also updated the language in its facebook audience network policy , which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content , to include fake news sites in some cases , the bots would post embarrassing photos , make references to the federal bureau of investigation inquiry into mrs clintons private email server , or produce false statements , for instance , that mrs clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail the use of automated accounts was deliberate and strategic throughout the election , the researchers wrote in the report , published by the project on algorithms , computational propaganda and digital politics at oxford because the chatbots were almost entirely anonymous and were frequently bought in secret from companies or individual programmers , it was not possible to directly link the activity to either campaign , except for a handful of joke bots created by mrs clintons campaign , they noted however , there was evidence that the mystery chatbots were part of an organized effort there does seem to be strategy behind the bots , dr howard said by the third debate , trump bots were launching into their activity early and we noticed that automated accounts were actually colonizing clinton hashtags a hashtag is used to indicate a twitter posts topic by adopting hashtags relating to mrs clinton , the opposition bots were most likely able to wiggle their way into an online conversation among clinton supporters after the election , the bot traffic declined rapidly , with the exception of some pro trump programs that gloated , we won and you lost , dr howard said trump campaign officials did not respond to requests for comment twitter executives argued that more people would not follow the programs and so they would be picked up only by those who looked for particular hashtags anyone who claims that automated spam accounts that tweeted about the u s election had an effect on voters opinions or influenced the national twitter conversation clearly underestimates voters and fails to understand how twitter works , said nick pacilio , a twitter spokesman the researchers based their study on a collection of about 19 4 million twitter posts gathered in the first nine days of november they selected tweets based on hashtags identifying certain subjects and identified automated posting by finding accounts that post at least 50 times a day for example , the top 20 accounts , which were mostly bots and highly automated accounts , averaged over 1 , 300 tweets a day and they generated more than 234 , 000 tweets , the researchers noted the top 100 accounts , which still used high levels of automation , generated around 450 , 000 tweets at an average rate of 500 tweets per day the oxford researchers had previously reported that political chatbots had played a role in shaping the political landscape that led to britains brexit vote the researchers have coined the term computational propaganda to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like facebook and twitter in a previous research paper , dr howard and bence kollanyi , a researcher at corvinus university of budapest , described how political chatbots had a small but strategic role in shaping the online conversation during the run up to the brexit referendum the bot managers seem to repurpose the programs as well during the british campaign , they discovered that a family of bots that had been tweeting around israeli palestinian issues for three or four years had suddenly become pro brexit after the vote , the bots returned to their original issue in the case of the american election , the researchers noted that highly automated accounts the accounts that tweeted 450 or more times with a related hashtag and user mention during the data collection period generated close to 18 percent of all twitter traffic about the presidential election they also noted that bots tend to circulate negative news much more effectively than positive reports one of the consequences of the intense social media campaigns will be a rise in what social scientists call selective affinity clinton supporters will cut the trump supporters out of their network , and trump supporters will do the same , dr howard said the polarization of the election is going to make this stuff worse as we self groom our news networks
ottawa the government of canada has a credit rating of aaa and a budget of over 200 billion you would think it could meet its payroll but for most of this year , getting paid has been an exercise in frustration for more than 80 , 000 canadian public servants not for lack of money , but because of a new payroll system that has repeatedly gone haywire one of the 80 , 000 is bill ryan , a leading seaman in the coast guard , a civilian agency his overtime and supplementary pay for duty as an air sea rescue worker stopped coming in july , and then in august , when he was out in the north atlantic aboard the patrol ship leonard j cowley , he discovered that he was no longer being paid at all he tried to address the problem online , but the satellite link available to him on the ship was so slow that downloading an email attachment could take a whole day he tried to deal with it by ship to shore telephone , but the government employee hotline kept putting him on perpetual hold he finally had to tell his wife back in newfoundland to put off buying back to school clothes and supplies for their three children it makes you feel pretty helpless , being 300 or 400 miles offshore when i have poor communications , and my wife is at home worried , mr ryan said it was an awful lot of worry and strain unwelcome payday surprises like mr ryans have troubled the canadian public service since february , when the government switched to the new payroll system , known as phoenix , and laid off about 2 , 700 payroll clerks who were no longer supposed to be needed the government manages a payroll of 20 billion canadian dollars a year , about 15 billion government leaders have promised that phoenix , which covers about 300 , 000 civilian government workers , will be stabilized soon but workers and their unions are skeptical , and the government has put off extending phoenix to cover the military and the royal canadian mounted police , a change that was supposed to happen on nov 1 every imaginable kind of pay problem appears to have cropped up , affecting every kind of employee , even some political aides to cabinet ministers some workers have been underpaid and others overpaid miscalculated deductions have left some workers with pay deposits that were not much more than pocket change and some , like mr ryan , were simply dropped from the payroll in error managers in some government departments found themselves lending their own money to subordinates to cover basic needs like groceries merchants in small cities where the government is a major employer have seen sales slump when a temporary system was set up to give emergency pay to affected workers , phoenix sometimes immediately took back what the system gave a number of people with skills in high demand , like nurses , have quit the government to work for employers with functioning payroll systems many of the employees who were hired to operate the phoenix system became so stressed by the flood of complaints that they took sick leave , leaving their office in miramichi , new brunswick , even harder pressed to cope every single payday , we get calls from our members , said chris aylward , the national executive vice president of the public service alliance of canada , a labor union when youve got the government of canada not able to pay its employees on time , it is a national disgrace still , mr aylward acknowledged that the previous payroll system , a 40 year old patchwork of software , needed replacing in 2009 , prime minister stephen harper , a conservative , hired ibm canada to create a replacement based on peoplesoft , a software system made by oracle that is widely used by corporations and institutions to manage operations , finances and employees what went wrong after that is a matter of debate , but probably involved a combination of blunders , poor planning and some wishful thinking judy m foote , who inherited phoenix when she was named minister of public services and procurement by prime minister justin trudeau last year , has asked the countrys auditor general for a post mortem everyone agrees that the job was not easy though many government employees work in 9 to 5 office jobs , the public payroll also includes a wide array of people like mr ryan with complicated work schedules and pay rules the government estimates that its 27 collective agreements with 15 unions , as well as its own policies , have led to more than 80 , 000 rules governing wages and salaries debi daviau , the president of another union , the professional institute of the public service of canada , is also a computer systems analyst who had private sector experience before going to work for the government she faults the government for turning to an outside contractor , ibm , to create the new payroll system , rather than relying on its own software developers once that choice was made , she said , the harper government put so much emphasis on saving money that it undermined efforts to ensure that the system would function well when they say ibm is adhering to the terms of the contract , its true , ms daviau said the government just didnt scope out the contract properly at a parliamentary committee hearing in september , ms foote said the conservatives had skimped on training for the 500 workers hired to run phoenix , versus actually buying into what ibm had advocated as the amount of training that really needed to take place while the conservatives have avoided answering direct questions about their role in the system , they have repeatedly accused the liberal government of bungling what they started blaming the previous government is like taking home a nice steak from the butcher and then burning it and blaming the butcher , kelly mccauley , the member of parliament who is the conservative spokesman on the issue , said at the september hearing the potential for trouble was apparent early on in may 2015 , when the conservatives still held power , ibm recommended pushing back the planned start up of phoenix at the end of that year it was postponed until february , but the government went ahead with layoffs of the payroll clerks anyway , making it impossible to keep the old system operating as a backup in case of teething trouble with phoenix phoenixs problems are far from being untangled , and new issues keep appearing but the government has managed to reduce the number of employees who have pay problems to about 18 , 000 , in part by rehiring some of the laid off payroll clerks to help out after a fitful start , an emergency pay system appears to have ended the need for managers to dip into their own bank accounts to help employees but instead of saving the government 70 million canadian dollars this year , as promised , phoenix has cost the government an extra 50 million \( about 37 million in united states currency \) , including 6 million in additional fees paid to ibm to fix it in a statement , ibm canada said that it continues to work in close partnership with the government to make phoenix work properly and that the remaining issues are primarily nontechnical the system is operating as designed , and the vast majority of the issues are process and data related still , phoenix continues to baffle some of those it was supposed to pay neil colbourne is an example he worked at government nursing stations in remote indigenous reserves in northern ontario until april , when he quit to take a hospital job in his native newfoundland at the time he left , he was owed about 4 , 000 canadian dollars in back pay because of phoenix problems in september , it appeared that the government would finally pay up but it deposited just a fraction of what it owed mr colbourne into his bank account 306 canadian dollars then , the government went back into his bank account and withdrew 346 canadian dollars , claiming that he had been overpaid since then mr colbourne says , he has been unable to get any answers from the call center but even though its call center is not responsive , the phoenix system hasnt forgotten mr colbourne im still getting a biweekly pay stub , he said
washington hillary clinton held back tears on wednesday as she asked her supporters not to lose heart after a crushing election loss and to continue working for a better country i will admit coming here tonight wasnt the easiest thing for me , mrs clinton said at a gala for the childrens defense fund , where she worked as a young law student there have been a few times this past week when all i wanted to do is just to curl up with a good book , or our dogs , and never leave the house again in her first public remarks since conceding to president elect donald j trump last week , mrs clinton told the crowd she was struggling to recover from an unexpected defeat that she said had left nonwhite children and vulnerable people across the nation afraid i believe the measure of any society is how we treat our children , and as we move forward into a new and in many ways uncertain future , that must be the test for america and ourselves , mrs clinton said in a 20 minute speech no child should be afraid to go to school because theyre latino , or african american , or muslim , or because they have a disability introduced by marian wright edelman , the groups president and founder , as the peoples president and the first woman to win the popular vote , mrs clinton , who had accepted the groups invitation before the election , said she had had to overcome deep sorrow to keep the commitment but she came bearing a message of resolve i know many of you are deeply disappointed about the results of the election i am , too more than i can ever express , she said i know this isnt easy i know that over the past week , a lot of people have asked themselves whether america was the country we thought it was she implored her supporters , though , to believe in our country , fight for our values and never give up mrs clinton has stayed out of the public eye since the day after the election , but in a private call with donors over the weekend , she cast blame for her loss on the announcement by james b comey , the f b i director , that he was reviving the inquiry into her use of a private email server as secretary of state she said that decision , by thrusting the email controversy back into the news 11 days before election day , had halted her momentum in the crucial closing days of the race and prevented her from ending her campaign with an optimistic argument to voters a second letter from mr comey , clearing her two days before the election , compounded the harm to her chances , mrs clinton told the donors , feeding into a narrative that the contest was rigged and causing wavering voters , including white suburban women , to abandon her on wednesday , though , there was no talk of opportunities missed or messages muddled instead , mrs clinton was regretful and the slightest bit defiant she said she wished she could go back in time and tell her mother , abandoned at a young age , not to despair look at me and listen , mrs clinton said she would have told her mother , her voice thick with emotion you will survive you will have a family of your own , three children , and as hard as it might be to imagine , your daughter will grow up to be a united states senator , represent our country as secretary of state and win more than 62 million votes in her campaign for the presidency democrats , stunned and dejected over last weeks electoral losses , are struggling to rebuild their party , re energize supporters and determine what lessons to draw from their defeat president obama told supporters in a call on monday afternoon that he expected to be a part of that debate starting in january , when he leaves office but it is not clear what role , if any , mrs clinton plans to play the event on wednesday , a beat the odds gala honoring at risk children who have found success , was in some sense a capstone to mrs clintons life in national politics the same event in 1992 was the first public appearance she and her husband , bill clinton , made after he won the presidency

after more than three years of digging into jpmorgan chases hiring practices in china , federal authorities have determined that the bank hired the children of chinese leaders as part of a quid pro quo to win business in the booming nation , clearing the way for a costly punishment as soon as thursday , the authorities will announce a roughly 264 million settlement with the bank and its hong kong subsidiary , according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity the authorities , which include criminal prosecutors and civil regulators , will accuse the bank of orchestrating a long running foreign bribery scheme when the new york times reported on the contours of a settlement in september , it was not known whether the authorities would explicitly accuse the bank of carrying out a quid pro quo providing jobs in exchange for lucrative assignments from chinese government run companies this issue , which strikes at the heart of whether jpmorgan violated united states law governing foreign bribery , became a focal point of the investigation and the ensuing settlement negotiations the bank argued that the hiring of well connected employees was routine in china , and that its own hires fell into a gray area of foreign bribery laws the united states government , however , concluded that in several instances , senior jpmorgan bankers explicitly linked those jobs or internships to securing deals with chinese government run companies , the people briefed on the matter said jpmorgan , the people said , formalized the hiring into what it called the sons and daughters program the bank even went so far as to create spreadsheets that tracked its hires to specific clients and the banks ability to convert these hires into business deals in reaching the settlement , jpmorgan is expected to accept the findings and conclusions of the investigators a spokesman for jpmorgan declined to comment , as did a spokesman for the justice departments criminal division in washington and the united states attorneys office in brooklyn the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve , which handled the civil regulatory aspects of the investigation , declined to comment the settlement , which was smaller than once expected because jpmorgan showed a high degree of cooperation with investigators , followed a painful period for the bank when the china hiring investigation first came to light in a front page article in the times three years ago , it added to a growing list of regulatory problems , including the 6 billion london whale trading scandal and a 13 billion settlement with the justice department over the banks sale of mortgage securities in the years before the 2008 financial crisis the china settlement will now put to rest one of the last big regulatory headaches for the bank some of the senior bankers suspected of carrying out the hiring have since left jpmorgan just as important , the agreement signals the final chapter in the obama administrations pursuit of wrongdoing on wall street that effort garnered big dollar settlements and splashy headlines , but no criminal prosecutions of top wall street executives after the financial crisis an absence that has drawn much criticism and public debate the foreign bribery case against jpmorgan is no different the united states attorneys office in brooklyn and the justice departments criminal division in washington are expected to impose a roughly 70 million penalty on the bank but will not charge any of the bankers who doled out the jobs the s e c will assess the largest punishment , about 130 million of the overall 264 million settlement , while the fed will impose a roughly 62 million penalty the bank also secured a moral victory by avoiding criminal charges , the people briefed on the matter said , and instead negotiated a rare nonprosecution agreement donald j trumps surprise victory in the presidential election last week could disrupt the public perception that banks are treated leniently steve bannon , a media executive appointed as mr trumps chief white house strategist , lamented in 2014 that not one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with the 2008 crisis mr trumps presidency also could be a turning point in how banks and other corporations do business in china on the campaign trail , mr trump called china a currency manipulator and threatened to impose tariffs on chinese imports , but as president elect he has shifted his tone and promised that the two nations would have one of the strongest relationships no matter the relationship going forward , the justice department is expected to continue enforcing the foreign corrupt practices act the 1977 law that underpins the case against jpmorgan and that might mean more cases against big banks operating in china the jpmorgan case would represent one of the first major crackdowns on a big bank for violations of this law , but deutsche bank , goldman sachs , hsbc and other banks have also hinted that they face investigations into their hiring practices in china those investigations may fizzle , but the jpmorgan case provides a template for prosecutors and regulators to bring these sorts of cases , which once seemed far fetched jpmorgans lawyers urged prosecutors not to criminalize hiring practices that were common in the region while hiring an american politicians child in exchange for a government contract is a clear violation of law , global companies routinely hire the sons and daughters of leading chinese politicians jpmorgan went even further , however , and hired the family members of potential clients while seeking their business specifically , jpmorgan hired the children of chinese officials running state controlled companies that were seeking banks to help them go public the foreign corrupt practices act essentially bars united states companies from giving anything of value to a foreign official to win an improper advantage in retaining business initially , jpmorgan sought to prevent such violations but as the sons and daughters program expanded , senior jpmorgan bankers explicitly tied those hires to securing deals with chinese government run companies , the people briefed on the matter said in an email previously reported by the times , a jpmorgan executive in hong kong linked one prominent hire to existing and potential business opportunities from a chinese government run company the executive also described the broader benefits of the hiring program , telling colleagues in another email you all know i have always been a big believer of the sons and daughters program it almost has a linear relationship with winning assignments to advise chinese companies
washington over the past month , president vladimir v putin of russia has received two starkly different messages about hacking into american computer networks from the current and future presidents of the united states dont you dare , and dont worry , were not even sure it was you the white house confirmed in a statement on wednesday that eight days before the presidential election , the united states contacted the russian government directly regarding malicious cyberactivity that was targeting u s state election related systems it sent the message over a rarely used system a hotline connecting the nuclear risk reduction centers in both countries , which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major cyberincidents the pre election warning only the latest after verbal cautions by president obama , his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by the washington post the warnings to russia against further hacking into polling or registration systems , or any further effort to affect the outcome of the election , are being hailed by the obama administration as a success in deterrence after all , they argue , a year and a half of russian hacking activity seemed to slow , or halt , and there is no evidence that voting or counting of ballots was disrupted on election day but more than a few experts in deterring cyberattacks take a more skeptical view they say the russians had already achieved their main goal to demonstrate how they could disrupt the american electoral process with the leak of hacked emails , including from the democratic national committee and hillary clintons campaign chairman , john d podesta mr putin suffered nothing worse than a warning , they note no sanctions , no counter cyberstrikes , no embarrassing revelations engineered by the united states and he now has the satisfaction of dealing with president elect donald j trump , who during the campaign praised him , promised to build a more productive relationship with russia and maintained there was no evidence that the russians were behind the hacking anytime anything wrong happens they like to blame the russians , mr trump said in an oct 10 debate with mrs clinton she doesnt know if its the russians doing the hacking maybe there is no hacking mr trump contended that the allegations of russian activity were intended to tarnish me for advocating a new relationship with moscow he frequently repeated similar sentiments in the last weeks of the campaign , suggesting the hacking was a fabrication the leaks of emails worked largely to his advantage , embarrassing democratic leaders like representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida , who was forced to resign as the chairwoman of the democratic national committee mr trumps larger strategic message is that the united states and russia need to cooperate on a range of issues but for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of american foreign policy and gives mr putin the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until mr trump is inaugurated on jan 20 it is also raising the question of whether the obama white house pushed back hard enough when american intelligence agencies concluded on oct 7 that only russias senior most officials could have authorized these activities james a lewis , a computer expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , dismissed the administrations claim that it had deterred russias hacking it seems a little bold to claim this is a success for deterrence , since the russians werent deterred from doing anything , he said their hacking work was mostly complete the issue now is whether they will be deterred in the future , and the guessing is they will not strong private warnings arent enough to constitute deterrence in fact , the russians appear to have paid less of a price for their hacking around the election than north korea did for its attack on sony pictures entertainment in 2014 that attack melted down about 70 percent of sonys computers and servers at its studios , wreaking considerable damage , and embarrassed many sony executives it was in response to the release of a movie , the interview , that imagined a c i a plot to kill kim jong un , the north korean leader after the sony episode , the united states issued more sanctions against north korea and encouraged china to limit the norths internet access , all of which runs through chinese switching centers many experts had expected the white house to follow a similar path with russia instead , the white house concluded that the warnings , and the unstated suggestion that the united states had the power to reach inside russian networks and see the origin of attacks , might suffice it is not clear if the administration plans any other actions against russia before mr obamas departure from office , but that seems less and less likely the oct 31 warning did not deal with the hacking of the democratic national committee or mr podestas account , which james r clapper jr , the director of national intelligence , had previously said was conducted with the knowledge of the russian leadership instead , it referred only to the concerns about hacking around the election process itself , and the fear it was originating from russian territory , though it stopped short of saying it was a state sponsored attack
howard ruff , an idiosyncratic economist , best selling author and political conservative best known for being bullish on gold and silver and gloomy about the economy , died on nov 12 in lehi , utah he was 85 the cause was complications of parkinsons disease , his assistant , joann allen , said mr ruff , a college dropout , had a roller coaster career , starting out as a stockbroker for a time he also supported himself as a singer \( one gig was at a synagogue , as what he described as the only practicing mormon cantor in san francisco \) he went on to run an evelyn wood speed reading business for a while which helped make him a millionaire until it foundered and his franchise was revoked , forcing him to declare bankruptcy rather than defeating him , however , the setback led to an epiphany , he said it inspired him to plunge into business cycle research and forge a career as a faddish investment adviser , which made him a millionaire for a second time but that enterprise , too , went belly up some people say that i couldnt succeed at anything , so i became a prophet of doom , he told time magazine in 1979 that turned out to be another successful calling in 1975 he started publishing a newsletter called ruff times , which mixed financial counsel \( predicting inflation and recommending investment in gold \) with conservative commentary it drew more than 175 , 000 subscribers he began a syndicated weekly television program called ruff house organized forums that offered , for a fee , more or less conventional investment advice and established companies that distributed natural vitamins and coins , as well as other for profit and self promotional ventures again he prospered , as reflected by a 20 , 000 square foot home in utah with an indoor pool \( he also said he had a hand in geopolitics , claiming some credit for the collapse of the soviet union he and his white house contacts , he said , persuaded president ronald reagan to sell stinger missiles to afghan rebels , whose guerrilla war with the soviet invaders had all but bankrupted moscow by the late 1980s \) mr ruff drew his widest attention in 1979 with his book how to prosper during the coming bad years it recommended survivalist strategies , like stocking a years supply of food , and directed readers to other books including safe places east of the mississippi and eating weeds for fun and freedom the book sold millions of copies and was a new york times best seller for more than a year until about 1981 , his followers reaped large capital gains by investing in precious metals but by several measures his portfolios later underperformed market indexes and even treasury bills , and some of his apocalyptic predictions did not come to pass , as inflation subsided and interest rates declined during the reagan administration , and when the economy rebounded after the 2008 financial crisis howard was a pioneer in the financial world when brokers encouraged investors to buy blue chip stocks and bonds and charged high fixed commissions , mark skousen , the editor of forecasts strategies , an investment newsletter , said in an email on tuesday ruff argued that wall street was hazardous to your wealth , especially investing in bonds that were big losers during the inflationary 70s mr ruff became bullish on the bond and stock markets in the early 1980s , changing the name of his newsletter to howard ruffs financial success report but it reverted to ruff times in the mid 80s , and in 2008 he updated his book on the coming bad years , warning that whoever won the presidency in 2008 would be doomed by rising oil and gas prices and spiraling monetary inflation to become the hoover of the 2000s among his other books were famine and survival in america \( 1974 \) and how to prosper in the age of obamanomics a ruff plan for hard times ahead \( 2009 \) unlike some of his doomsaying colleagues , though , mr ruff maintained a following through an engaging wit and a general willingness to admit mistakes urging investors to be mavericks , he compared the breed to a bovine thats left the herd , adding , and i feel the majority of the herd is going to be turned into hamburger in recommending readiness for economic collapse , he reminded his disciples , it wasnt raining when noah built the ark he co founded a conservative lobbying group called free the eagle , and in 2000 he fought , unsuccessfully , to prevent hillary clinton , who had transplanted herself from arkansas and washington , from winning a senate seat from new york his ruffpac political action committee prepared a television commercial that benignly featured babies and puppies playing in central park it asked rhetorically what they had in common , responding they have all lived in new york longer than hillary rodham clinton howard joseph ruff was born on dec 27 , 1930 , in berkeley , calif , the son of the former rena maxberry , a seamstress , and wilson ruff , who killed himself when howard was 6 months old i grew up broke , he recalled we were too poor to afford a father he had wanted to be a singer since the age of 9 , but , at his mothers insistence , instead of accepting a scholarship to the curtis institute of music in philadelphia , he served a two year mission in the eastern united states for the mormon church he later majored in music education at brigham young university in utah with a minor in economics but by his senior year , he told the new york times in 1979 , i ran out of money and got out of college before it did me any personal harm , like ending up teaching high school music courses instead , after joining the air force , he toured with its symphony as a baritone soloist and also performed with the mormon tabernacle choir mr ruff released an album , howard ruff sings , in 1982 on his own label , target records , featuring songs like i walked today where jesus walked , if i were a rich man , climb every mountain and my way i did it for the shock value , mr ruff said i also did it to change my image i have always been painted as a cardboard figure of doom mr ruff is survived by his wife , the former kay felt 13 of their 14 children \( some of whom were adopted \) larry , eric , david , megan and timothy ruff , anthony ramon , david steinberg , pamela patterson , sharon slater , patty simpson , liza spencer , debbie rasmussen and terri lynn bond 79 grandchildren and 48 great grandchildren by 2002 , mr ruffs fortunes had slipped again the circulation of ruff times had plummeted to 3 , 000 , according to kiplingers personal finance , and he had long sold his 10 acre utah estate and moved to smaller quarters he was a self made millionaire twice he lost it all twice , his family said in a statement he often said he learned more from his failures than from his successes but he retained admirers the journalist and financial analyst mark hulbert wrote on marketwatch com in 2013 , it would be easy to miss the lasting contribution howard ruff made to the investment advisory business mr ruff , he wrote , had brought into the mainstream the notion that we dont need to rely on a wall street broker or analyst for advice on what to do with our money he added , ruff gave voice to the millions of middle class investors who felt that the countrys financial system was rigged against them
when donald j trump emerged from the haze of his surprise victory in the presidential election , one of his first calls was apparently to an early supporter , a controversial radio host and conspiracy theorist with a large following the supporter , alex jones , the host of the alex jones show and the operator of the website infowars , says he fielded a phone call on friday from the president elect , thanking mr jones for his support the call served as a reminder that mr jones , who has been repeatedly denounced in the mainstream news media , will remain someone whose support mr trump wants he was just thanking me for fighting so hard for americans , and for americanism , and thanking my listeners and supporters and to let me know that he was working really hard around the clock , mr jones said in a telephone interview this week mr jones said he urged mr trump to hold to his pledges to go after the corruption in the government , and at least remove a lot of the establishment aides to mr trump declined to respond to an email seeking comment on the phone call as a candidate , mr trump generated headlines when he appeared on mr joness texas based radio show during the republican primary contests for a nearly half hour interview mr jones thanked him at the end , informing the candidate that he would be hit for the appearance on what is considered a fringe show , despite its large audience among mr joness more suspect stances are his insistence that the shooting at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut was a hoax and that the government is creating chaos by manipulating weather systems he has been loudly and roundly denounced by democrats and some republicans he is also a vocal opponent of trade and immigration , two issues that dovetailed with mr trumps hard line positions during the primaries i think hes emerged as the single most powerful voice on the right , roger j stone jr , a longtime informal adviser to mr trump , said of mr jones it was mr stone who connected mr trump with mr jones months ago elitists may laugh at his politics , mr stone said , adding , alex jones is reaching millions of people , and they are the foot soldiers in the trump revolution mr jones said mr trump had promised to come on his radio show in the next few weeks and the radio host is positioning himself as someone who will hold mr trump accountable to the most anti establishment voices in his party mr jones said he planned to hold the incoming president to his campaign promises that includes appointing cabinet members who will pursue investigations of hillary clinton , he said if that does not happen , mr jones said , yes , people will be upset it will be an indication of a return to politics as normal , he added mr jones , who railed against the establishment news media throughout the interview , also warned mr trump to keep listening to the grass roots voters who helped elect him among the president elects interviews since his victory has been a traditional sit down with the cbs news program 60 minutes , one of the most establishment venues in journalism if he starts acting like hes divorced from us and doesnt care about us , theyll turn against him , mr jones said of mr trumps followers mr trump needs to complete only a portion of his promises , he said if he gets 20 percent done , people will be happy , he said
there are more reasons than ever to understand how to protect your personal information major website hackings seem ever more frequent a set of top secret national security agency hacking tools were dumped online over the past year in may , hackers used some of those tools to hijack computers around the world in a medium post , quincy larson , the founder of free code camp , an open source community for learning to code , detailed the reasons it might be useful for people to make their personal data more difficult for attackers to obtain when i use the term attacker i mean anyone trying to access your data whom you havent given express permission to , he wrote , whether its a hacker , a corporation or even a government in an interview , mr larson walked us through some of the basic steps he recommended we added a few of our own , based on additional interviews and news events we encourage you to send any questions or feedback about this article to smarterliving nytimes com encryption is just a fancy word for scrambling your data so no one can understand what it says without a key its useful for protecting information on your computer , but also for making sure prying eyes cant snoop on text messages and emails on your phone but encryption is more complex than just switching a couple of letters around signal is one of the most popular apps for those who want to protect their text messages it is free , available for iphone and android , and extremely easy to use , but it does depend on your friends downloading and using it along with you and unlike apples imessage , which is also encrypted , the code it uses to operate is open source , which is easier for an independent security expert to examine without the special permission of the developer you can be sure by looking at the code that theyre not doing anything weird with your data , mr larson said in general , the idea behind the app is to make privacy and communication as simple as possible , said moxie marlinspike , the founder of open whisper systems , the organization that developed signal whatsapp , the popular chat tool , uses signals software to encrypt its messaging and in facebook messenger and googles texting app allo , you can turn on an option that encrypts your messages heres how to do that on facebook heres how to do it on allo in may , cybercriminals used ransomware , a type of software that locks down peoples data and threatens to destroy it if the attacker is not paid , to hijack hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide such attacks are often spread through malicious email attachments and links , a practice known as phishing so make a rule of not clicking on anything when you do not know where it will take you , even if it appears to come from someone you know also , make sure to update your software regularly , particularly your operating system frequently , software companies will release updates that patch bugs and vulnerabilities when they are discovered but outdated or unauthorized copies of the software may still contain the security flaws this is a particular problem with computers using microsoft windows , the most popular operating system in the world and therefore a big target for hackers finally , for those using windows , antivirus software can go a long way toward shoring up protection mr chen recommends antivirus tools from bitdefender or malwarebytes your phone may be the device that lives in your pocket , but mr larson described the computer as the real gold mine for personal information even if your data were password protected , someone who gained access to your computer would have access to all your files if they were unencrypted luckily , both apple and windows offer means of automatic encryption that simply need to be turned on in apples macos , filevault can be enabled from the security and privacy system preferences panel apple has detailed instructions to enable it here microsoft windows users must be running windows 7 ultimate or the professional version of windows 8 , 8 1 , or 10 to use bitlocker heres a guide on how to check , and how to turn it on similarly , keep your data backed up if something happens to it , or you lose it all , you can recover quickly without hassle an online backup service , like crashplan , a favorite of the wirecutter , a new york times company , backs up your data and encrypts it at the same time even an external hard drive gives your files an extra layer of security backups will protect your photos , documents and other data not only from a technical malfunction , but from ransomware and other malicious hacking just make sure to test or check your backups periodically you know this by now creating strong passwords and never using the same password across sites is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion not everyone agrees about frequent password changes most say you should use really strong passwords and no more than one password per site , then use the password managers but making up new combinations all the time is irritating and inconvenient , tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple that is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes its far better to create really strong ones for every login and new passwords can pose security risks , because its hard to remember complex ones , so you are tempted to write them down that can lead to a lot of hard to remember passwords to keep track of them , mr larson recommends password managers , which help store many passwords , with one master password he said he uses lastpass but knows plenty of people who use 1password and keepass , and he doesnt have a strong reason to recommend one over another as far as making passwords up goes dont be precious about it use a random word \( an object near you , for example \) , scramble the letters and sprinkle in numbers and punctuation marks if youre writing passwords down or using a password manager , you dont have to worry about making them memorable when you turn on two factor authentication , anyone trying to sign in to your email from new devices will have to go through a secondary layer of security a code that is sent to your phone via text message \( though sadly , not through signal \) heres a link to turn on two factor authentication for gmail accounts heres one for yahoo accounts , and heres one for outlook accounts you should also set two factor authentication for social media accounts and other sites where its available but email is the most important account , since many sites use email for password recovery , a fact that hackers have exploited once they have access to your email , they can get access to banking , social media , data backups and work accounts mr marlinspike recommended this plug in , developed by the electronic frontier foundation , a digital security organization it ensures that you are using the secure form of websites , meaning that your connection to the site will be encrypted and that you will be protected from various forms of surveillance and hacking download https everywhere for chrome here for firefox here heres a list of faqs about the plug in , including whether it is available for other browsers and this is a good time to note that you should always find out whether the wi fi network you are using is secure public networks and even private networks without security keys often are not the timess personal tech expert , brian x chen , recommends using a vpn to shield browsing information , encrypt all of the data coming to or leaving your computer or phone , and hide your location vpns create an encrypted tunnel through which all of your data is sent , meaning other computers or devices on the same network as your computer cant make sense of it the only people who have the key in this case is your computer and the vpn provider you connect to when you turn it on this is especially useful on public wi fi networks , like at the airport or coffee shop , where you dont know who else is using the same network some vpns are free , and others require monthly subscriptions the best offer apps for your phone as well as your computer mr chen highlights three providers freedome by f secure , tunnelbear and a service called private internet access this feature , available on chrome , safari and firefox , among other browsers , may sound secure , but pay attention to the clear warnings on chrome , the second paragraph of the incognito home screen spells it out for you you arent invisible , it says going incognito doesnt hide your browsing from your employer , your internet service provider or the websites you visit in reality , it simply keeps your

q a many web based mail services including yahoo , gmail , icloud and outlook com give you the option of downloading your messages to the computer through a stand alone email program , instead of only keeping them online some people prefer this because it keeps copies of the messages locally on the computer for archiving doing this makes the downloaded mailbox contents accessible without an internet connection , too for mail services with storage limits , downloading the messages to the computer also helps free up space online some people prefer using desktop programs to more easily manage mail accounts from multiple services or to avoid the advertisements that are the price paid for using a free service downloading messages from a web based service takes a bit of setup , although the windows and mac operating systems have simplified it by allowing you to select a popular mail service from a list and enter your user name and password to add it to the computers mail program you usually have to enable message downloads to a stand alone program in the account settings of your web based email service keeping your mail online has its advantages , especially if you check the account from multiple computers and devices storing your mail online also means it is backed up depending on the mail service you use , you may get better spam filtering through the web version google has also added several useful tools to its web based gmail service , like instant translation from other languages or messages bundled into topics \( like shopping or travel \) with its inbox by gmail service
a swedish union has set up a hotline for workers to report instances of mansplaining as part of a weeklong effort to raise awareness of a certain kind of condescending elocution that men use to explain to women things they already understand well , actually , its not all men who do it , of course , but a certain kind of man you know him he is probably getting ready to mansplain this article to you the hotline , which is temporary and open to men and women , was set up by unionen , a trade union that represents about 600 , 000 private sector employees in sweden and describes itself as the largest white collar union in the world our objective is to contribute to awareness and start a discussion which we hope will be the first step in changing the way we treat each other and talk about each other in the workplace , jennie zetterstrm , a union spokeswoman , said in an email on wednesday its important to create awareness about how seemingly small things that we do or say add up to a larger issue between 10 a m and 4 p m every day this week , members are being encouraged to phone the hotline to talk about mansplaining in their working lives the calls will be answered by 20 men and women , who are gender experts , authors , academics and others the most important thing when we consulted these people is that they have knowledge and interest in the issue , ms zetterstrm said both women and men carrying valuable experience for such a type of activity so far , ms zetterstrm said , callers have asked for advice on speaking up when they feel run over by male colleagues , and on how to help female colleagues who are being ignored by men in their working groups others have asked how to address clients or colleagues who address only the male employees even when a woman is in charge and how to address men who get credit for a womans work the term mansplaining a portmanteau of explain and man entered popular usage after the author and historian rebecca solnit published a 2008 essay titled men explain things to me she described attending a party at which a man insisted on explaining to her a very important book he had heard about and did not immediately seem to absorb that she had written the book with a knowing roll of the eyes and a deep sigh , women and some men recognized the experience ms solnit relayed , and a new word was born just this year , a man wrote to the advice columnist amy dickinson to complain that she had misused the term in her response to an earlier letter she replied that his letter contained an almost magical dynamic others complained that i had misused the word mansplaining , but you are the only person to mansplain while doing it and last month , the word was featured as an answer on jeopardy \( the correct response was given by a male contestant , for 600 \) predictably , the hotline in sweden has prompted a strong reaction the independent newspaper reported that unionens facebook page had been inundated with negative comments , particularly from men our intention has never been to point fingers or blame all men , our intention has simply been to spark an interest and start a debate at our work places and in society , ms zetterstrm said she added that the debate had been lively , and said , of course its regretful if someone feels offended but the union says it hopes the hotline raises awareness of gender discrimination in the workplace and , in doing so , perhaps helps to alleviate it obviously not all men subject all women to mansplaining all of the time , wrote peter tai christensen , one of the gender experts who will be manning the phone lines that would be an absurd assertion and not based in reality but enough women are subjected to it by enough men for it to be a problem that warrants being addressed , discussed and resolved

perth , australia for this competition , the most astonishing name on the start list for 100 meters did not belong to usain bolt but what dharam pal singh of india lacked in renown , he more than made up for as an international man of mystery if singh really was 119 , born on oct 6 , 1897 , as his passport said , his presence would be extraordinary at the world masters athletics championships this would make him not only the oldest known runner in the world but probably the oldest man in the world the problem was , many people did not believe his story we suspect that he is lying about his age , said vinod kumar , the senior joint secretary of the masters athletics federation of india dr thomas t perls of boston , a leading researcher on centenarians , said the oldest age ever validated for a man was 115 the eldest confirmed person was jeanne calment , a frenchwoman who died in 1997 at 122 in his experience , said perls , the director of the new england centenarian study at boston medical center , 99 percent of all claims of being 115 or older are false the chances of singhs being 119 and a competitive runner probably equaled the odds of building a rocket ship and going to pluto , perls said inconceivable and yet , he added , if singh was , say , in his 90s , any running he did was still spectacular singh denied exaggerating his age in late october , he had more immediate concerns a farmer , he lived in the indian village of gudha , nearly 5 , 000 miles from the world masters championships he wanted to reach perth by oct 24 to prepare to run the 100 , 200 and 400 meters he had paid his entry fee but did not have money to buy an airline ticket he also needed a visa he would travel to new delhi maybe a politician there would arrange the necessary funds for australia im willing to stay in a cheap room , singh said , but i want to go otherwise , the oldest competitor would be an australian legend , john gilmour , 97 , a world war ii veteran who was captured by the japanese and put into forced labor malnutrition and the harsh conditions permanently shrouded his vision still , he resumed his running career after the war he knew what a body could withstand the pain of sport was nothing compared with the pain of capture to read , gilmour needed a magnifying glass he wore sunglasses outdoors to shield his eyes he could see the lanes of a track , but he could not read the bib numbers of his competitors faces were smudged he met people and shook hands and said hi and hoped that was enough not to be considered a stuck up bugger if he did not recognize a friend despite his impaired vision , he once set world masters records from 800 meters to the marathon he went 10 years without a defeat on the track in his mid 60s , he could still run a marathon under three hours his shock of white hair , always combed in a neat pompadour , even in the middle of races , gave him the serene , yearning look of a pioneer despite all the adversity in life , theres a way to survive , said stan perkins , an australian who is president of world masters athletics , the sports governing body thats john he should have died as a prisoner of war , but he didnt he came home and recovered he got back to competing at the absolutely top level on a track a half hour from his home , gilmour was coming out of retirement for his first meet in 11 years four thousand athletes from 91 countries were scheduled to compete at the world masters championships from oct 26 to nov 6 , the equivalent of the olympics for runners and throwers and jumpers 35 and older gilmour had entered the 800 , 1 , 500 and 400 , in that order in his final event , one of his opponents could be dharam pal singh hard to believe , gilmour said of any athlete who could be 119 hes lucky to be alive , much less jogging around yet , despite uncertainty about his age , singh was as stirring to some indian athletes as gilmour was to australian athletes hes healthy and active thats inspiring to me , said abdussamed ambzhthingal , a relative sprinting novice at 75 unlike gilmour , who lived a cataloged life verified by documents , photographs , trophies , medals and two biographies singh could not produce a birth certificate they were not regularly issued in indias villages when he was said to have been born such gaps in birth registration tended to skew masters records toward athletes from more developed nations and disproportionately hindered athletes from africa , india and elsewhere in asia , said harmander singh , a social policy analyst and marathon coach from london he had coached another runner born in india named fauja singh now a british citizen , fauja singh gained widespread attention in 2011 when he ostensibly set eight world age group records at a track meet in toronto and became the first centenarian to complete a marathon yet fauja singh , now said to be 105 , also lacked a birth certificate he could not convince masters officials or guinness world records of his age none of his achievements have been certified as records people in the third world are at a disadvantage for being taken seriously , said his coach , harmander singh masters officials vigorously denied bias in the way they treated athletes or apportioned records they were simply trying to be fair to everyone , said sandy pashkin , an american who is the chief record keeper for world masters athletics this was not considered a trivial matter for competitions and world records , given that age groups were divided into five year increments a runner in , say , the 70 74 category could have a considerable advantage over someone in the 80 84 category for four years , officials said , they had patiently requested that dharam pal singh provide reliable evidence to verify his birth date school records , military records , baptismal records , medical records , school records of his children we have absolutely nothing to prove how old he really is , pashkin said he could be 80 he could be 100 we dont know through the years , singh had not been consistent in listing his age at meets , officials said one said that he registered for this world masters championship as a 117 year old , not a 119 year old but he was given the benefit of the doubt , and his entry was accepted , with an asterisk if he traveled to perth , singh would be allowed to compete in the 95 to 99 category any record that he set would not be validated , but any medal that he won would be awarded a duplicate medal would be given to any competitor he beat everyone elses age in that group had been verified there were mixed feelings among meet officials singh might distract news media attention from all other competitors but , whatever his age , his presence would promote healthy living and he might also draw bigger crowds people could decide for themselves how old he appeared tall and thin , wearing a turban and a beard , singh was said by officials who had seen him run to possess a fluid stride and a great sense of theater before races , he sometimes went into the grandstand to be photographed and he pulled out his cellphone to speak to someone , or to pretend to speak to someone when he runs the 100 , he spends five minutes cheerleading , winston thomas of britain , the secretary of world masters athletics , said with a chuckle come on at that age , who does that \? perkins , the president of world masters athletics , said he , for one , hoped that singh showed up we like the old guy , perkins said hes a really lovely man look , he probably really has no idea how old he is , to be quite honest dharam pal singh arrived for an interview in new delhi carrying his own traveling bag and a handbag he did not wear glasses or use a walking stick for two or three hours in the company of a reporter , he appeared alert and comprehending his passport said his birthday was oct 6 , 1897 the same date appeared on his election voting card and his permanent account number , a code used for taxes these are all valid government documents but not the primary documents to certify age singh said he did not have a birth certificate he said he was illiterate and did not have a school certificate , either his mother provided a horoscope , which became the basis of his age , he said , but he was not carrying it with him his eldest son , born in 1949 , was also illiterate and lacked a birth certificate and a school certificate , singh said he also said that none of his contemporaries in his village were still alive singh carried two more documents one listed him as the first place finisher at 200 meters \( 50 26 seconds \) for sprinters 100 and over at the 2014 malaysian masters athletics championships the other document was perhaps more significant it was an age certificate , dated may 21 , 2014 , and stamped and issued by the chief medical officer of the meerut district in the indian state of uttar pradesh singh had not provided any documentary evidence to substantiate his age , the certificate said but based on general appearance and x rays taken at p l sharma hospital meerut , singh appeared to be 100 it was unclear how credible the certificate was but it was signed by the chief government doctor in the region where singh lived those who accuse him of inflating his age are jealous of my health , my age , my running , singh said , speaking hindi people say i do not look like 119 , he said if i walk with a stick and with a bent back , then i would look like 100 plus without a stick , with a straight back , i look like 80 to 90 plus my good health has become my misfortune age fraud was uncommon at the world masters championships because there was not much incentive beyond a medal and a certificate , said ken stone of la mesa , calif , the founder and editor of masterstrack com and a watchdog over age group running its much more common to find evidence of doping than to find evidence of age fraud , stone said yet , within the niche sport , there had been a small number of high profile cases of masters athletes who performed remarkable feats but could not satisfactorily prove their age to record keepers an ostentatious incident , stone said , had occurred at the 2011 world meet in sacramento , calif a 46 year old egyptian named mohamed megahed finished 14th in the long jump in the 45 49 age group then he borrowed a bib and entered the 50 54 age group , furtively seeking a better result against older competitors , only to be disqualified douglas kalembo , an olympian who represented zambia at the 1988 seoul games , appeared in 2010 to become the first 50 year old to run faster than 50 seconds in the 400 meters but his mark was never ratified , masters officials said , because of conflicting documents that suggested he might have been 39 or 40 at the time instead of 50 in september 2015 , a dispute arose about which of two men , both said to be 105 , had become the worlds oldest , fastest sprinter at 100 meters guinness world records sided with hidekichi miyazaki of japan world masters athletics sided with stanislaw kowalski of poland at the time , officials also wrestled with the case of an 80 ish greek man named symeon symeonidis his father was said to have altered his birth certificate , making him appear younger so that he could be eligible for food rations after world war ii but the story could not be verified , said kurt kaschke , a german who is president of european masters athletics symeonidis , kaschke said , was later penalized for age falsification kaschke wrote a plaintive letter about the uncertainty that officials faced with some of the most elderly runners was a birth certificate valid if the original no longer existed \? what should be done about athletes born during the first or second world war , when many records were destroyed \? how could a birth date be proved when a government was not able to verify a birth on a particular day \? or when a country did not issue birth certificates \? these were questions without clear answers , kaschke wrote to stone last fall , but you see it makes it difficult for all statisticians in the world to find the truth the situation may be further complicated by the refugee crisis in europe , as people flee countries like syria , afghanistan and iraq , often without documents , as they seek a new life , masters officials said the issue of older athletes of indeterminate age was not so much growing , but i wouldnt say it was rare , said thomas , the secretary of world masters athletics most times , weve been able to sort something out historically , there have been numerous reasons people made false , inaccurate or unsubstantiated claims to extreme longevity , according to perls , the boston medical center expert on aging the fountain of youth and shangri la myths appealed to personal vanity the soviet union asserted that people supposedly living into their 150s or 160s in the caucasus the birthplace of stalin proved the superiority of communism some hindu yogis in india claimed to be 200 or older , drawing followers to their religious beliefs a person claiming to be of extreme age could also draw great attention and could be a source of pride and reverence for a family , a village , a country not all told deliberate falsehoods , perls and colleagues wrote in a 2010 study some who purported to be 110 or older were convinced of their ages , having been told so by others , the study said or they had forgotten as they grew older about an intentional or erroneous change in their birth date from a long time ago yogendra singh , a sociologist who has done field work in indias villages , said older people tend to relate their ages to historical or other events in the past in the process , they have a tendency to orchestrate their age as it suits them , said singh , a professor emeritus at jawaharlal nehru university in new delhi it is always relative and rarely absolute dharam pal singh said that his long life had nothing to do with fabricating his age his secret was cows milk , herbal chutney and seasonal fruit that ripened in sunshine he avoided butter , fried food , sugar , tobacco , alcohol , even tea and coffee intoxicants make you empty from inside , he said he grew wheat , rice , sugar cane and vegetables , slept on a hard bed to keep his back straight and awakened at 4 in the morning after retiring at 11 p m he began running while herding cows when he was a teenager even now he tried to run four to five kilometers a day i may compete until im 125 , singh said he said he had been inspired by fauja singh , supposedly the first centenarian to complete a marathon he had seen him on television and read about him in newspapers but , he noted , i have broken all of his records his wife , lakhmiri , was between 90 and 95 he had three sons , four daughters and 21 grandkids , though one of his suggestions for good health , besides running , was to marry late and produce no more than two children he was not competing for his own sake , dharam pal singh said i am trying to increase the pride of my nation , he said my body is dedicated to my country at 6 30 a m , hours before he was to run the 800 , john gilmour dressed in a track suit and shuffled a couple of laps in his backyard a retired gardener , he had built a small earthen track years ago amid the bottle brush trees and geraniums sixty laps equaled a mile he had used the track when recovering from injury or when his wife , alma , was sick with his poor eyesight , he did not have to worry about getting lost or being hit by a car or , if alma needed him , he was right there he mowed his yard and spread grass clippings on the sandy soil to make it spongy for his thick legs alma had died four years ago after struggling with arthritis and liver cancer john quit running in 2005 to take care of her she had let him compete all over the world , he said , and he wanted to let her see i thought more of her than my running into his 70s , gilmour had kept a rigorous training schedule if it rained , he rode an exercise bike in the backyard shed until the weather cleared weekly , he headed into the bush to run in soft sand , using a power line overhead to keep him from straying off course sometimes he spray painted markings on the road like dharam pal singh , he avoided tobacco and alcohol his comeback for the world masters championships seemed a natural curtain call for a brilliant career perth was his adopted hometown but he had not been able to train as fully as he wanted , saying he had been slowed by prostate cancer , a bladder infection and a chest infection he fretted about a urostomy bag that would protrude below his running shorts still , gilmour had tried to run two or three kilometers each day , waking early and circling the perimeter of his brick home each lap was precisely 80 meters old age always wins , gilmour had said in his kitchen the previous afternoon , displaying various medications and supplements he had been taking its shocking no matter how hard you try , it beats you he had the stamina to keep going , but speed eluded him now , as if it were a baton he could not grasp in a relay you seize up , gilmour said if you lose your balance , you fall over if you fall , how do you get up \? but his motto , as a prisoner of war and as a runner , had been dont give in eight hundred meters on the track would equal 10 laps around his house at least im going to finish , he said i just hope i dont embarrass anybody four runners were scheduled in the 95 99 age group gilmour was particularly concerned about arthur carbon , a fellow australian and a former professional runner carbon had not run in 50 years but was also tempted out of retirement by the world masters championships the night before the race , gilmour had felt a bit restless he had struggled to get to sleep , worried about strategy , of all things if hes too fast , ill let him go , he had said of carbon hes 96 , a young guy as gilmour arrived at the track , he said he felt a bit nervous he wore a green and gold uniform , the colors of australia it was a perfect spring afternoon , cloudless , breezy , a bit of chill in the shade he had worried needlessly carbon withdrew from the 800 to concentrate on the sprints two other runners in the 95 99 age group also scratched , citing injury and illness so two age groups were combined gilmour was paired with dumitru radu , 90 , a trim romanian who wore a black bathing suit decorated with soccer balls and the logo of the 1990 world cup in italy animated , with a popeye ish look , radu spoke german and told vivid stories complete with sound effects he said he had been a wood cutter who fought in russia in world war ii he hugged volunteers and drank brown liquid from a water bottle coca cola \? he was asked nicht coca cola , he said kaffee brasilien coca cola kaput ! before the race , the two men shook hands radu bowed he seemed frail , keeping his legs wide and stiff as if running on stilts but his form was overcome by determination and stamina radu had already won the eight kilometer cross country race again , he took the lead because the men were in different age groups , each would receive a gold medal if he crossed the finish line gilmour persisted with a run walk style he had not been on a track in more than a decade and was no longer accustomed to the long straightaways wind gusted in his face along the backstretch as both men headed toward the finish , the small crowd began clapping and rose to its feet alan bell , the race director , said this is not athletics this is more an example of the human spirit radu crossed first in 8 minutes 59 53 seconds gilmour finished in 9 19 53 a small smile creased his face each runner sat in a chair and had a cup of water im really pleased that i managed to finish , gilmour said gold medals were placed around the runners necks in separate ceremonies each stood atop the podium as his national anthem was played well done , john ! gina grayson , 42 , told gilmour she and her sister , sue malaxos , a marathoner at the 1996 atlanta olympics , had been coached by gilmour grayson brought her two children to watch him run and gave him a kiss on the cheek everyone was standing on their feet , grayson said good on you brian kennedy , 83 , a longtime friend , touched gilmour on the shoulder and joked the drug testing people are out there they want to see you two more races remained on gilmours schedule , but there would be no meeting with dharam pal singh in the 400 the indian runner did not show up for the 100 he said by telephone that he had received travel money from supporters but had not received an official entry card for the meet so he could not obtain a visa there were no official entry cards , officials said was this an excuse by singh \? a misunderstanding \? the mystery deepened i dont have any regrets for myself , singh said but i regret that my going to australia would have increased the pride of india there was other bad news arvind kumar singh , a subdivisional magistrate , or civil servant , in the district where dharam pal singh lived , said that the authorities had received a complaint about him last year it was related to an award he was to receive and whether he was eligible we found his claim about his age as false , arvind kumar singh said a school transfer certificate had been found based on the certificate , he said , dharam pal singh was 78 or so and he was not illiterate the age was corrected on singhs election card , but he continued to use an old card to hide his age , the civil servant said this seemed to verify something a reporter had noticed earlier singh said he was illiterate but he could clearly read signs on the new delhi metro rail system and emails on his mobile phone id love to know just what age the man was , stan perkins , the president of world masters athletics , said anything from 80 years and up , he would be competitive , without a doubt singh ran so well that he would probably still be competing in 10 years , perkins predicted sandy pashkin , the organizations chief record keeper , laughed thatll make him 130 \? quite possibly , perkins said
los angeles porsche or tesla \? the valet asks the question hastily , humbly , eyes not quite meeting those of the contemplative man standing before him frank ocean has been staying at this secluded hotel here for a while now , long enough that when the valet spies him coming down the front path , he knows the routine on this night , its the tesla , the model x s u v with the gull wing rear doors inside , the dash looks like the helm of a spaceship , with a center console map display bigger than an ipad that , once on the road , mr ocean never consults its been more than a year since hes had a steady home most of his beloved cars are in storage he moves from city to city , hotel to hotel in a couple of days , hell be in new york , looking for an apartment a day after that , hell turn 29 four years ago , he released channel orange , a clever , sinuous , supremely confident deconstruction of contemporary soul , and announced that his first love had been with a man in the subsequent months , he was nominated for six grammys , performed at the ceremony and toured the world and then , he was gone not quite a full disappearance , but something like it what had appeared to be the beginning of a stunning ascent instead curled into a question mark finally , this past august , mr ocean returned , and with a bounty a visual album streaming online , endless , followed by another digital album , blonde , complemented by a glossy magazine , boys dont cry , distributed at pop up shops in four cities but apart from a lighthearted note and a couple of photos posted on his tumblr , mr ocean didnt speak publicly having emerged from the ether with fanfare , mr ocean returned to it quietly , his mystery intact not that you would be able to sense the swirl of curiosity that surrounds him by his demeanor during conversations over two days last month edited excerpts are below he was preternaturally calm , consistently forthright , reflexively self aware , and wryly funny this has been the case for years it made him something of an outlier when he emerged as part of the rabble rousing odd future collective , and an outlier still when he catapulted into pops top ranks , a group of people not much given to pensive remove over the past three years , his absence from the pop troposphere a void interrupted only by the occasional collaboration , tumblr post or paparazzi shot has felt like a position statement against celebrity culture , while simultaneously guaranteeing that mr oceans fame , turbo boosted by fervent curiosity , would grow even wider his exile began in earnest in 2013 he was living here , in a glass walled apartment high over sunset and vine , with a panoramic view of south los angeles but the city was choking him people had stolen money from him there were physical sorts of things going on in the streets and he grew concerned about the management of his affairs it started to weigh on me that i was responsible for the moves that had made me successful , but i wasnt reaping the lions share of the profits , and that was problematic for me i had , in the midst of all of this , this feeling of isolation , he added within my circle , there was a lot of places i thought i could turn that i felt like i couldnt turn to anymore so he left , hopping a plane to london , a city where he barely knew anyone , with only a duffel bag full of clothes and a backpack carrying the precious hard drives holding all of his music theres a fine line between a sane escape and running away did you feel you were on one side or the other of that \? i never thought about it like that i always thought about it like , if your house is on fire , you need to get out of the house did you feel that certain things in your career also hadnt gone the way you would have liked \? certain moments were drawbacks for sure now i look at things differently , but at the time , yeah audiences in excess of five million people on national tv i was always reluctant to do those things except in cases where they had this nostalgic significance to me like performing at the v m a s , being tapped to perform at the grammys me saying yes to those things had a lot to do with how those things made me feel before i was actually in the business and just wanting to be rubbing shoulders with those people and being seen at those places i still was reluctant and sort of skeptical of those things because i questioned whether or not i was prepared i feel like the public knock on you is that you want to be anonymous , or you want to be in some kind of retreat from the spotlight sometimes im fascinated with how famous my work could be while im not so famous super envious of the fact that daft punk can wear robot helmets and be one of the most famous bands in the world , while also understanding that will never be my situation its too late its hard to articulate how i think about myself as a public figure ive gotten used to being frank ocean a lot of people stopped me on the street when i hadnt put music out in a while , literally would yell out of an uber , frank , where the album \? has dating been difficult for you in this period of increased celebrity \? i think normal would be the word , whatever that word means , which is usually nothing im in a very different place than i was four or five years ago with all that stuff different in my relationship with myself , which means everything theres no , like , shame or self loathing theres no , you know , crisis have you been in love since then , since 2012 \? not the lasting kind control is often at the forefront of mr oceans mind when he was on tour , his concerts would be recorded each night , and he would watch the tape , type up notes and email them to his team to prepare for a morning meeting when blonde and endless were being recorded , he carried the hard drives with his music in his backpack , and the backups , too id rather the plane goes down in flames and the drives go down with me than somebody put out a weird posthumous release when he answers questions , he takes meaningful pauses , mulling over premises , before answering in expansive stories paired with precise bursts of logic after bouncing around hotels in london , he moved into a furnished apartment that he eventually stripped bare of all but the essentials i just wanted to be able to walk around and not run into an end table or some useless piece of furniture he rode electric bikes around the city , made new friends which is not as difficult as celebrities make it sound went on dates he recorded in a handful of studios , including abbey road , where he asked for the studio , too , to be decluttered , removing furniture and bringing in flower arrangements piece by piece , the music that would become blonde and endless was coming together , though up until then , it had been slow going hed begun recording at electric lady in new york , but after he took a pause away from the studio , the rhythm of writing was gone i had writers block for almost a year , he said during that time , he would go to the studio , stare at the monitors and come up with nothing , or nothing that i liked that dry spell broke only after he reconnected with a childhood friend from new orleans who was going through difficult times that conversation , he said , made me feel as though i should talk about the way i grew up more he decided that he wanted blonde and endless to be more autobiographical than his earlier releases i wrote channel orange in two weeks , he said the end product wasnt always that gritty , real life depiction of the real struggle that happened so he turned inward , and backward , telling stories about his childhood , family life , and romantic relationships some frivolous , like on nikes \( he dont care for me but he cares for me and thats good enough \) some meaningful , like on self control \( wish wed grown up on the same advice \) that was written about someone who i was actually in a relationship with , who wasnt an unrequited situation , he said it was mutual , it was just we couldnt really relate we werent really on the same wavelength in places , like on ivy , he manipulated his voice to sound younger , to better capture the time he was evoking many of the new songs have two or three competing narratives different points of view participating in the same story that was my version of collage or bricolage , he said how we experience memory sometimes , its not linear were not telling the stories to ourselves , we know the story , were just seeing it in flashes overlaid on blonde , especially , you used a lot of different voices sometimes i felt like you werent hearing enough versions of me within a song , cause there was a lot of hyperactive thinking even though the pace of the albums not frenetic , the pace of ideas being thrown out is are they always multiple points of view , or are they multiple franks interrupting each other to be heard \? its the same thing to me because my point of view from one emotional state to another is a different point of view sometimes i want to talk on a song and be angry , because i am angry then theres always a part of me that remembers that this record lives past my being angry , and so do i really want to be angry about that \? is that feeling going to have longevity \? were you working toward a fixed idea on these albums \? or was it mutating and evolving as you went \? when i was making the record , there was 50 versions of white ferrari i have a 15 year old little brother , and he heard one of the versions , and hes like , you gotta put that one out , thats the one and i was like , naw , thats not the version , because it didnt give me peace yet you were reaching for something ineffable \? theyre just chords , just melodies i dont know what combination of those objects is gonna make me feel how i need to feel but i know precisely the feeling that needs to happen at the same time he was chasing a perfect feeling sound , he was trying to regain control of his business relationships he replaced his team new management , new lawyer , new publicist and he began negotiations to free himself from his contract with def jam , the label that had signed him in 2009 and effectively shelved him until his self released debut mixtape nostalgia , ultra caused a stir online in 2011 a seven year chess game is how he described the process of buying himself out of his contract and purchasing back all of his master recordings using his own money , he said as a condition of the arrangement , he said , def jam took on distribution of his next project , endless , which is available only as a streaming video album on apple music then , less than two days later , came a big surprise blonde , released independently by mr ocean \( apple music paid to host the premiere of blonde , but mr ocean said there was no ongoing relationship with apple \) this was mr oceans checkmate , an album wholly his own that took center stage blonde debuted atop the billboard album chart with the third biggest opening week of the year , behind only drake and beyonc when releasing endless and blonde , he took his time i know that once its out , its out forever , so im not really tripping on how long its taking he described his mood after the release of blonde as postpartum rather than going on a promotional tour , playing radio festivals and making the usual rounds , he spent about a month traveling china , japan , oceania , france , just around casual you solved some rather intractable business issues you recalibrated the cast of professionals who work on your career were those your main goals \? with this record in particular , i wanted to feel like i won before the record came out , and i did , and so it took a lot pressure off of me about how the record even would perform after the fact once the goal is met , everything else is lagniappe its not essential for me to have a big debut week , its not essential for me to have big radio records what about the data side , the numbers , the sales \? i know exactly what the numbers are i need to know i need to know how many records ive sold , how many album equivalents from streaming , which territories are playing my music more than others , because it helps me in conversations about where were gonna be playing shows , or where i might open a retail location , like a pop up store or something do you feel like the numbers are commensurate with what you thought they would or should be \? well , we doubled channel orange first week im always gonna be like , we could have done a little bit better i guess theres a satisfaction that comes with looking at numbers like that , and im making , like , no limit type of equity , master p type of equity on my record and there have been accolades , too in 2013 , mr ocean won two grammys , and he has been nominated since , but come february , he will not win any , because he chose not to submit his music for consideration that institution certainly has nostalgic importance , he said it just doesnt seem to be representing very well for people who come from where i come from , and hold down what i hold down he noted that since he was born , just a few black artists have won album of the year , including quincy jones , herbie hancock and ray charles though mr ocean said the grammys reached out to his representatives , he never spoke with them directly before making his decision i think the infrastructure of the awarding system and the nomination system and screening system is dated , he said id rather this be my colin kaepernick moment for the grammys than sit there in the audience this willingness to remove himself from a situation not designed for him to thrive in is perhaps mr oceans greatest gift his backbone is firm though he still publishes emotional decrees on tumblr from time to time his note on the death of prince was heart rending he largely avoids social media his twitter is gone usually a handful of trusted colleagues , friends or family members make him aware of things he might need or want to know \( it was his agent who told him about kanye wests recent grammy related speech on his behalf \) he is as much refusenik as artist what he does may be less important than what he chooses not to do and moving forward , what he may choose not to do is release an album without a visual component , or even release something album length at all because im not in a record deal , i dont have to operate in an album format , he said i can operate in half a song format or he might devote less time to music i believe that im one of the best in the world at what i do , and thats all ive ever wanted to be , he said its more interesting for me to figure out how to be superior in areas where im nave , where im a novice a few weeks ago , he was flying back from washington with his mother after a white house state dinner , where he had been one of president obamas guests mr ocean told her how hed been poking around the visual arts degree offerings at the new school , thinking about what it would take to begin to learn and refine a new craft oh , you dont have time to do that , she told him and he replied , mom , im rich ! hes laughing now after a long drive , the tesla is parked behind an anonymous recording studio , where hes about to go work on new music i wasnt trying to flex up on my mom , he said rather , it was a personal service announcement to me , to just be like wait , look at your position , you have the luxury of choice now hes finished laughing , back in control this has always been my life and no one elses , he said , and thats how its always been since the day i came in it
phil jacksons description of lebron jamess business partners as his posse in an interview published by espn on monday drew an angry response from james , who took offense at the racial connotation of the word the dispute between jackson , the knicks president , and james , who plays for the cleveland cavaliers and is one of the n b a s most visible players , also left knicks forward carmelo anthony in the uncomfortable position of having to answer questions about a sudden feud involving one of his bosses and one of his good friends the espn interview was a wide ranging q and a in which jackson talked about the state of the knicks , the criticism of his management of the team , and his relationship with anthony but james took exception with jacksons description of the group of friends who travel and work with him as his posse james and maverick carter , his close friend and business partner , both took offense at jacksons use of the word carter told espn com he was bothered because of the idea that jackson said it because james and his friends are young and black , he can use that word james said he had lost respect for jackson as a result of the comments we see the success that we have , but then there is always someone that lets you know how far we still have to go as african americans , james told reporters in cleveland i dont believe that phil jackson would have used that term if he was doing business with someone else and working with another team or if he was working with anybody in sports that was owning a team that wasnt african american and had a group of guys around them that didnt agree with what they did i dont think he would have called them a posse but it just shows how far we have to go but it wont stop us from doing what we need to do as a group james , carter and two other high school friends , rich paul and randy mims , founded l r m r management company a decade ago the agency handles marketing and representation duties for james and other n b a players the company has been successful since its inception , positioning james as one of the top athletes turned entrepreneurs of his generation in the espn interview , jackson , responding to a question about jamess decision to leave the miami heat , and whether he could imagine magic johnson leaving pat riley and the los angeles lakers or michael jordan leaving jackson and the chicago bulls , turned his response back around to james when lebron was playing with the heat , they went to cleveland and he wanted to spend the night , jackson told espn com they dont do overnights teams just dont so now spoelstra a reference to the heat coach , erik spoelstra has to text riley and say , what do i do in this situation \? and pat , who has iron fist rules , answers , you are on the plane , you are with this team you cant hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in cleveland jackson did not respond to jamess remarks tuesday he left knicks practice without speaking to members of the news media and did not respond to an email while posse is defined as a group of friends or associates , keith gilyard , a professor of english and african american studies at penn state , said he could understand why james took offense the cultural definition of the word has shifted toward defining drug cartels or , in cultural terms , the group of hangers on that surround a celebrity what were talking about is a rhetorical moment , and one of the things thats interesting about rhetoric is sort of the study of who can say what to whom and under what conditions or can say what whom and under what conditions , gilyard said the word in and of itself is never neutral it never means the same in all contexts and when the word is used publicly , as by jackson , instead of in a private conversation , its connotation changes , gilyard said when you have an official or executive that uses that language that makes its way into mainstream circulation , it has a different meaning , he added meaning shifts depending on contexts with jackson unavailable , it left anthony , a close friend of jamess , to answer questions about the subject anthony agreed that he considered posse a loaded term , and he said that he would not want his group of friends or family to be referred that way but anthony declined to ascribe any assumptions or intent to jackson do i think he meant it any kind of way \? anthony said i really dont know i dont think he did i would hope that he didnt sometimes phil just says things and he says the first thing that comes to mind and then probably is in his office right now regretting it i dont know when it comes to phil , you just never know whats going to be said , whats coming out it depends on whos listening people take it the right way or people take it the wrong way you just never know when it comes to phil i just dont understand him talking about lebron right now , in november i dont understand that
in the week since donald j trumps election as president of the united states , much has been written about the potential conflicts of interest a sitting president with a global business may encounter \( among other things \) less attention , however , has been paid to the even fuzzier situation of the close family members of a sitting president , and their business interests though on monday , it became clear that this is another potential minefield , at least when it comes to the first daughter ivanka trump and a brand that is largely built on her image a group of journalists , including reporters at the new york times and vogue , received an email from ivanka trump fine jewelry , the upscale brand ms trump founded in 2007 , entitled style alert and touting ivanka trump wearing her favorite bangle from the metropolis collection on 60 minutes the bangle , a gold and diamond bracelet that costs 10 , 800 on her website , was clearly pictured on her wrist during her interview with her father , stepmother and grown siblings with lesley stahl on sunday night such emails are not uncommon among fashion brands , which tend to trumpet every celebrity sighting in their products to the world at large what was different about this email , however , was that it came not from the communications office , but from the vice president for sales , the person in a brand who would generally work with a companys wholesale partners \( in ms trumps case , stores such as neiman marcus in georgia , florida and illinois , and charles schwartz son in washington , d c \) and that after pointing out the bracelet , it urged recipients to please share this with your clients in other words , it used ms trumps appearance by her fathers side to directly promote the selling of her products when reached , monica marder , the vice president , said repeatedly , i am not available for comment , and then , when asked if she had sent the email , hung up the phone but a day later , abigail klem , president of the ivanka trump brand , said this notification was sent by a well intentioned marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary protocol , and who , like many of us , is still making adjustments post election we are proactively discussing new policies and procedures with all of our partners going forward this is not the first time ms trumps brands have used her role in her fathers political career for marketing purposes in july , ms trump wore a dress from her own collection to introduce her father at the republican national convention \( she also wore her own brand shoes and jewelry \) the next day , her company tweeted out a picture of her from the podium with the words shop ivankas look from her rnc speech and a link to the macys website , where a similar style from the brand was offered the 138 dress reportedly sold out in a day at the time , the decision was met with some opprobrium , even though the stakes were lower mr trump has stated that his children will have no formal roles in his white house , because they will be running his business , and there is no law that prohibits presidential relatives from continuing their own business , though section 713 of title 18 of the united states code forbids the use of likenesses of the presidential seal for promotional purposes ms trump has not come close to that , but the appearance is still ethically blurred whether or not ms trump knew of the bracelet email before it was sent , her name is still on the top of the alert in the past , attempts by relatives to profit from a connection to a president , such as billy carters introduction of billy beer during his brother jimmys administration , and the creation of roger clintons band , politics , during his half brother bills terms in office , were roundly deemed inappropriate the tension between ms trumps position on her fathers transition team and her unofficial , but powerful , role as a representative of women and the younger generation in his organization , and the fact that she is her own best ad and her brand is thus understandably using her as a celebrity , makes the issue even more complicated , and it underscores her status in the public eye and the amount of attention she will incur the question now is how she uses it
beijing the chinese authorities said on tuesday that they had executed a farmer convicted of killing a village official after the demolition of the farmers home , despite months of public outcry in sympathy with the farmer the execution of jia jinglong , 30 , took place in shijiazhuang , the capital of the northern province of hebei he was sentenced to death last november on tuesday , he was allowed a brief visit with his family , the state news agency xinhua reported while mr jias trial had focused on the brutal nature of the crime he was found guilty of killing the official , he jianhua , by shooting him in the back of the head with a nail gun it was the demolition of mr jias home that stirred anger among a public that saw it as yet another government snub against the powerless mr jias three story home was destroyed in may 2013 to make way for a new property development according to chinese news reports , his father had agreed to the demolition in exchange for compensation and a new apartment promised by local officials , but mr jia refused to abide by the agreement nevertheless , the home was knocked down shortly after the demolition , mr jias planned wedding was canceled by his fiance over the following months , mr jias appeals to officials , citing his opposition to the demolition and what he said was insufficient compensation , went nowhere , his family said , and he snapped on feb 19 , 2015 , he fatally shot mr he the murder and subsequent trial have been a reminder to many of the consequences of chinas rapid urbanization the forced demolition of homes has been a leading cause of protests across the country in recent years dozens of farmers have set themselves alight in an extreme form of protest against the practice in a brief telephone interview before the execution , mr jias older sister , jia jingyuan , said her brother was also a victim forced demolitions have also exposed fault lines in chinas attempts to reform its judicial system , a topic that has gained traction in recent years amid rising social tensions chinese farmers , with limited education and at the bottom rung of the social ladder , often find the judicial system broken and discriminatory lawyers and scholars have taken notice an open letter to chinas supreme court , signed by 12 leading chinese legal scholars and lawyers and posted online on monday , argued that the courts sentence glossed over local corruption and mr jias contrition for his crime it called the courts determination of basic facts a major mistake and called for mr jias life to be spared the letter said that the lack of a fair minded judiciary allowed an evil administration to trample on residents rights , creating countless incidents of mass petition and violence against law enforcement zhang qianfan , a law professor at peking university who signed the petition , said in a telephone interview that he was disheartened by the execution i think the supreme court had already made up its mind , and to reverse its stance is very hard despite the social backlash peoples daily , a newspaper controlled by the communist party , criticized the petition in an opinion piece published the day before the execution it said that the court must not back down in the face of public anger and dismissed the letter as biased and detached from reality despite official attempts to quell public anger over the execution , the outcry might have some impact on chinas death penalty system , william nee , china researcher at amnesty international , said in an email the public got a rare peek into the opaque death penalty system , he said , and view how hard it is for lawyers to properly defend their clients , gain access to legal documents and evidence , and have their arguments taken into consideration the intense scrutiny of the courts decision will most likely force judges to act with greater restraint in the future , he added
third party travel booking sites such as expedia com and booking com are go tos for travelers in search of wallet friendly accommodations or deals on packages that include both airfare and a hotel stay but as sites to book high end vacations \? not so much that is , until recently today , these sites and two new search engines skylark and lola are looking to attract consumers seeking luxury getaways by including prestigious hotels in their inventory and selling discounted packages that combine luxe accommodations with business or first class flights with skylark , which is part of the luxury travel network virtuoso , users pay an annual 400 fee to get favorable rates on 700 upscale hotels , discounted high end packages and phone , email and live chat access to a team of about 20 travel agents we want to be a luxury online travel agency where our clients can plan their own vacations but also rely on a travel adviser if they need to , said paul tumpowsky , skylarks chief executive and co founder if , for example , a member is considering two hotels in london the connaught and the beaumont they can instant message an adviser to inquire about amenities , location and other deciding factors the advisers can also arrange airport transfers , theater tickets and tours but skylarks biggest attraction may be the discounts \( up to 60 percent off \) and perks it offers on upscale air and hotel packages a recent example is a four night stay for two at the mandarin oriental barcelona with round trip business class flights on american airlines from john f kennedy airport in new york city to barcelona el prat airport the trip costs 6 , 588 for two , compared with 10 , 190 if airfare and hotel were booked separately and because the mandarin barcelona is a part of virtuoso , members who book this package receive the propertys virtuoso amenities such as an upgrade , if space is available , and breakfast lola , a free chat based iphone membership app , is also a virtuoso member , with around 1 , 100 of the apps 250 , 000 bookable hotels being virtuoso properties where clients receive extra benefits , said lolas chief marketing officer , robert birge one example is the ritz paris , where perks might include a room upgrade , early check in and checkout , breakfast and airport transfers lola and skylark are coming into the market at an opportune time , said the travel industry analyst henry harteveldt , the founder of atmosphere research group , because affluent consumers rely on digital technology for much of their travel planning but these high income travelers also use travel agents , and both search engines offer a chance to work with agents booking and expedia , both around since 1996 , are also getting into the luxury game on booking com , reservations at five star properties grew 40 percent from september 2015 to september 2016 , compared with the same period a year earlier , said leslie cafferty , a vice president and head of global communications expedia , meanwhile , is pursuing luxury travelers with the premium package business it introduced last year the packages pair flights in business and first class with upscale hotels and sell them to consumers for an average of 20 percent savings , compared with the cost if each were booked separately there is a shrinking price gap between economy and premium cabin airfare , and we saw an opportunity to offer discounted packages that bundle these airfares with stays at luxury hotels , said sarah gavin , a spokeswoman for the company at any given time , expedia has at least a few thousand premium packages for sale a recent one , at a cost of 3 , 800 a person , was a seven night stay at the park hyatt tokyo from dec 12 to 19 with round trip business class airfare from new york city some luxury hotels see an upside to being a part of third party travel sites franois delahaye is the chief operating officer for the dorchester collection , a group of 10 properties that includes the htel plaza athne in paris , which can be booked on skylark and the other three search engines he said that third party travel sites are a way to bring in more business we get a new set of clientele who may not be familiar with our brand , and sell inventory , mr delahaye said what doesnt make sense about that \?
arthur brooks hi , gail so just when we thought that 2016 couldnt get any more shocking , it did , with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the universe , what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned goods \? gail collins greetings from the land of duck and cover , arthur not sure its quite sunk in but yes , freeze dried foods and subterranean real estate are in demand arthur duck and cover sounds like a hunting club so where shall we begin \? gail im a little weary of the why it happened conversations lets get right to it what do you think will happen next \? arthur donald trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog chucho will chase squirrels the world will go on gail glad to hear chuchos taking it well arthur he stayed cautiously neutral in the election , but hes a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps thats a good place to start a conversation about the future ive been amazed , since i came to washington , at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in 2008 , democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable gail hey , i made a point ! things are looking better already arthur both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive fatalism , like the classic threats to leave the country gail reader email has informed me its way harder to leave the country than one might think we americans arent in all that much demand arthur and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is permanent , they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side gail well , looking at a president trump and a republican controlled house and senate , id say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president obama did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to george w bush , who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the iraq invasion but obamacare was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea arthur i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in 2009 , even though they dont have to , it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into obamacare some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in it and sure enough , here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology thats why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to this is spinal tap turn it up to 11 give on a few things where you dont have to , because someday youre going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing administrations horror at seeing some or all of obamacare repealed gail we part company here my perception of obamacare was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican position , just a ton of people who wanted to be deal makers but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that weve left behind the old lets have a drink after work congress weve now got guys who sleep in their offices and dont even talk to the other side at the house gym arthur secretly a lot of them are actually friends , but i take your point and thats another recommendation i would make to president trump make friends everyplace that was the l b j reagan clinton magic dont golf with the same people every week gail since i have no choice , im prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of obamacare is so great that even if hillary clinton had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised something better and as of his 60 minutes interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so well see what he comes up with i know youre a big paul ryan fan his agenda and trumps agenda really dont match , do they \? arthur congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next years , and ryan and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe ryans plan includes a health care replacement plan for obamacare it will actually do some of the things liberals \( and conservatives \) really want , like getting more people covered i realize that its very disappointing for progressives to see obamacare repealed , but its not like it will be replaced by nothing gail this is one area where the product doesnt usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate barack obama saying all health care negotiations could take place in public , on c span grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions im seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt arthur its certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his or her congressman and says , dont just do something , sit there ! gail only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining its too big but lets move on im obviously cranky arthur really \? how come \? gail any other postelection mullings \? how about the early appointments \? the republican establishment seems super relieved to have reince priebus as white house chief of staff but steve bannon is going to be chief strategist which could mean anything to me priebus is the kind of guy democrats should learn to live with they lost , and theres going to be a republican white house but bannon is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the trump crowd who do you think will really have the presidents ear \? arthur it looks like both will be influential after watching the campaign , i didnt find sundays pair of appointments too surprising they signal that in office , as during his candidacy , trump will seek to merge traditional republican politics with his unconventional brand of populism gail and what about immigration \? it seems now the wall may be a fence , and the deportees will be only criminals barack obama has been trying to deport undocumented immigrants who break the law for years dont see where the big switch is arthur i think thats right , given what weve heard so far in that 60 minutes interview , trump said that securing the southern border will probably involve a mixture of wall and fence , and that he plans to limit deportations to illegal immigrants who have committed crimes those steps would not require the kind of massive deportation force that some predicted and feared gail ive been thinking a lot about the source of trumps strength rural areas and declining small cities havent you always told me that one of our problems is that americans have stopped moving to where the jobs are \? apparently youre right and theyd prefer to stay put , be angry and elect donald trump president arthur thats one interpretation another is that people simply dont have the skills for the promising jobs that would require a move , especially since we stopped teaching vocational and technical skills so they stay put i find this the more compelling view gail i always prefer the explanation that doesnt just boil down to get a move on , lazy arthur i have three teenagers , so i confess to using that approach sometimes as to how all this affected politics , my colleague nick eberstadt published a wonderful book earlier this year called men without work it shows the collapse of employment among working class middle aged men over the past 50 years this got much worse in the wake of the great recession and the disappointing recovery , most of which yielded no income growth for the entire bottom 80 percent of the income distribution in other words , the obama administrations economic recovery was only really salient for the richest fifth of the population gail important point , which i plan to reiterate regularly when trump begins his economic program by reducing taxes for the rich and regulations on the banks arthur the problem isnt just material hardship , especially given the expansion of welfare benefits its the loss of dignity that comes from not creating value through honest work for years , neither party has addressed this dignity crisis for men without a college education theres an obvious connection here with the explosion of suicide and opiate abuse in rural america gail i think were all pretty clear today that theres a cry of rage from non college educated white americans and trump was pretty good on the rage cry end but beyond a huge infrastructure repair plan which clinton was actually clearer on i havent heard a whole lot of trumpian solutions arthur when trump talked about kicking out illegal immigrants and canceling nafta , experts scoffed at the unworkability and undesirability of the specific proposals but i talked to tons of people supporting trump who basically said i dont know if that stuff will work but finally theres a guy who at least is saying hell try something to bring back jobs finally , someone who cared about them gail the bottom line was change versus no change thats almost always the way voters decide presidential elections and i am sorry to say that hillary clinton was the no change candidate all she promised was more of the obama administration plus that infrastructure repair it made sense in many ways the country has recovered from a stupendous economic collapse under obama but if youre not a happy camper , nobodys going to convince you by showing you graphs on the unemployment rate arthur i know this election is really hard for progressives to swallow , but theres a way to understand it , at least in part a few years ago i was having lunch with neera tanden , who is president of the center for american progress \( conservative and liberal think tank presidents are secretly friends , too \) i asked her to given me a simplest explanation for why some people who never prospered over the past few years nonetheless loved president obama so much she said , he gives them dignity i thought that was very profound , and i think thats a big part of whats going on today as well with trump gail i like your analysis , as far as the voters emotions goes as to trumps ability to follow through well , well see how it works out especially if the new administrations first move to support the common man is deregulating the banks arthur i just laughed out loud about that one gail but the holidays are coming , arthur , and everybody deserves a little bit of a break from 24 7 politics thats why god invented football arthur obviously we share the same basic theology gail well be taking a conversational break , too but while im being thankful on thanksgiving , ill be counting our talks as one of my blessings arthur me too , gail happy thanksgiving
if you spend your days amid ancient clay tablets with one of the earliest forms of written language , the thought might occur to you wouldnt it be fun to bake your own tablets out of gingerbread for the office holiday party \? it did to katy blanchard , 38 , who is in charge of the near eastern collections at the university of pennsylvania museum of archaeology and anthropology the museum has one of the worlds largest collections of cuneiform tablets from early mesopotamia , many of them written by ancient scribes who used a reed stylus to etch pictograms into clay ms blanchard , whose passions are archaeology and baking , used chopsticks , a fish knife and a gingerbread recipe that came packaged with a coliseum shaped cookie cutter she once bought not only did her cuneiform cookies beguile her colleagues at the office party , they also gained some measure of internet renown after a penn museum publicist posted an article about how she made them \( sample comment from the public mine will probably taste more like the dead sea scrolls \) from there , cuneiform cookies started to become as the newspaper the forward put it a thing bloggers were enthralled , including one who said she was taking a class in hittite and opted to practice on shortbread \( the writing took a long time , she observed \) the archaeo culinary trend also exposed an odd subculture of people who are consumed with ancient languages , like the guy who uses the twitter handle dumbcuneiform and runs a business that will translate your tweets and texts into cuneiform characters and etch them in a hand held tablet \( no , you cannot make this stuff up \) it really struck the world in just the right nerdy place , said ms blanchard , noting that a number of people , including home schooling parents , classroom teachers and scholars of ancient languages , had taken the idea and run with it people have made some amazing tablets , much more complete and creative than mine , ms blanchard said some people made full sentences mine just say , god , build , bird and sun cuneiform , which is pronounced cune ay uh form and means wedge shaped writing , was devised by the sumerians more than 5 , 000 years ago and survived until about 79 or 80 a d it emerged at roughly the same time as early egyptian writing , and served as the written form of ancient tongues like akkadian and sumerian , which thrived in what is now southern iraq because cuneiform was written in clay \( rather than , say , on papyrus \) and important texts were baked for posterity , a good amount of it survives today schoolchildren who visit the penn museum get to try their hand the deepest part of every symbol is the upper left , because thats where you start with your reed , and then you just swirl it around , ms blanchard said ancient schoolchildren did the same thing , and some of their efforts are on view at the museum , written on hand held practice tablets theres like a first day tablet , where you can see someone practice the first wedge over and over and over again , like i practiced an a in school , ms blanchard said in a babylonian classroom , she said , there would be a bucket in the middle of the room where students would toss their practice tablets for recycling those reusable tablets , she said , were like the original etch a sketch ms blanchards title at the museum is keeper , which involves caring for the artifacts in the near eastern collections and helping visiting researchers and scholars find the right items to advance their work its a combination of putting small things in boxes and knowing where jars of dirt came from , as she put it once in an interview the cuneiform tablets are in the babylonian collection , which is not in her purview , but they inspired her nonetheless it was a holiday party several years ago that prompted ms blanchard to contemplate the similarities between clay tablets and cookie dough she has been making cuneiform cookies annually ever since , usually for the same holiday party last year , i tried to make a brownie ziggurat , modeled on an ancient temple , but it did not go over as well , she said although ms blanchard surmises that shortbread might also be a good medium for cuneiform , it was the gingerbread that went viral , inspiring copycats online inspired by ms blanchards cuneiform cookies , esther brownsmith , a ph d student in the bible and near east program at brandeis university who has been studying akkadian for years , went all out for a new years party , she baked four tablets of gingerbread , each on a 13 by 18 inch pan , and copied part of the enuma elish , a seven tablet babylonian creation myth , onto them a stunning step by step description of this feat has drawn thousands of likes on her tumblr blog ms brownsmith said a friend emailed her a link to the penn publicists article about ms blanchards cookies my first thought upon seeing her how to was , oh my god , this is completely brilliant and completely my thing , ms brownsmith said in an email interview im a semiprofessional baker in my spare time , and ive read everything out there about ancient mesopotamian cooking , she said i even baked historically accurate flatbread for my akkadian classmates once at the time , she was studying the enuma elish for an akkadian exam , so the tablets she baked each of which took her about half an hour to inscribe counted as homework at the party , nobody wanted to be the first person to break the tablet , ms brownsmith said eventually , i had to break them up myself to get people eating now that she is teaching freshmen , ms brownsmith has assigned \( in english \) one of the two best known texts written in cuneiform the epic of gilgamesh \( the other is the code of hammurabi \) gilgamesh was a mighty king from the mesopotamian city of uruk , the name of which is thought to have morphed into iraq and ms brownsmith has translated part of the epic into snacks i like baking for my students , mostly to bribe them in to office hours , ms brownsmith said so cuneiform cookies seemed like a great way to feed them while also giving a tangible link to the subject of gilgamesh
many seats on ryanair flights could be free in a decade , with the airline making its money from sharing revenues with airports , boss michael oleary said this week but of course , flying isnt and wont really be free the average cost to ryanair of carrying a passenger is 47 69 \( 40 71 at current exchange rates \) , according to the companys 2016 annual report , while the average cost of a ticket is 46 67 \( 39 85 \) thats a loss of around 1 on every ticket it sells but it was able to record a large profit because it made around 1bn from ancillary revenues in other words , baggage charges , priority boarding , sandwiches and drinks sold on board , travel insurance and so on it turns out the average traveller spends 14 74 on extras , which is where the real money is so if you really want to be a low cost traveller , the trick is to avoid all the things ryanair tries to sell you dont buy extra legroom or priority seatsryanair charges 15 22 50 each way , on top of the normal fare , if you want to reserve a seat in rows one and two , or 16 and 17 by the emergency exits , as they have extra legroom most other seats on ryanair are charged at an extra 8 each way yet frequent travellers know a trick that works most of the time , whereby they obtain a premium seat without paying extra during the booking process you will be asked to reserve a seat just click no thanks ryanair will subsequently send out emails to remind you to check in , and imploring you to pay for a reserved seat ignore them the best time to check in is between two and three hours before your flight in most cases you will then automatically be allocated one of the 15 premium seats crucially , make sure you complete check in before the final two hour deadline after that , you will have to do it at the airport , at a cost of 45 why does this work \? we have not had this confirmed by ryanair , but the thinking is that it does not sell all its premium seats , but does fill most of its aircraft it keeps the premium seats open until the last possible moment but the final few checking in have to be seated somewhere , so they are rewarded with one of the empty premium seats the problem with this trick is that it is not guaranteed and , crucially , only really works for solo travellers if you are in a group then it will mean you are almost certainly split up ryanair told us while we welcome enterprising ideas , its important to note that our load factor for october was 95 , and the only way for customers to guarantee their preferred seat is to purchase a reserved seat dont waste 2 50 on a bottle of water a 250g bag of m ms is 4 on its flights , but a 300g bag bought at asda costs 2we all know \( or should by now \) that you cant take more than 100ml of liquid through security on board , ryanair capitalises on this by charging a stiff 3 2 56 to thirsty travellers who want a bottle of water but all you have to do is pack an empty plastic bottle and fill it up at a water fountain after security in the airport terminal some airports , presumably at the behest of retailers , will hide the water fountain as best they can , but there usually is one at gatwicks south terminal it is on the upstairs concourse , down a corridor leading to the toilets and theres nearly always a savvy traveller there topping up their bottle those dinky wine bottles can also be found for 2 50 in duty free before flying , although ryanair rules say you cant drink your own alcohol on board of course , once on board it will sell you wine at 6 7 per mini bottle the same goes for snacks you are perfectly free to carry fruit , vegetables and all solid foods through security in your hand baggage , although soup will breach the rules sandwiches on board ryanair cost 4 50 , but you can make some at home before ryanair says you are free to take your own food and a 250g bag of m ms is 4 3 40 on its flights , but a 300g bag bought at asda costs 2 avoid 80 baggage costsa 15kg bag costs 10 40 each way , and another 5 or 10 if its 20kg above that , each kilo costs another tenner unless its the depths of winter and you need heaps of clothes , ryanairs free baggage allowance , though mean , should get you through you are allowed a free 10kg hand luggage bag the size of a small wheelie plus a further small bag ryanair representatives used to have a stormtrooper reputation for seizing vaguely oversized bags , weighing them and charging accordingly , but in recent years have become more lenient martin lewis from moneysavingexpert demonstrated on the itv tonight programme how to squash a vast amount of stuff into your jacket or coat wearing a 22 pocket scottevest us survivalist jacket , he managed to squeeze in a laptop , two books , a towel , passports , a t shirt , socks , magazines and much more even though it was heavier than hand luggage , airlines dont have rules to stop it yet , he said ignore the 5 priority boarding feeit remains a mystery to frequent travellers why so many people opt for priority boarding , which will be 10 on a ryanair return it is not uncommon for priority customers to be first down the steps to be greeted by a bus waiting on the tarmac but when the bus doors open its a free for all some people opt for priority to ensure space in the luggage rack , but it can be easier , and faster , to leave your wheelie bag on the tarmac to be put in the hold , for free , and then collect it on arrival but the hotel and car hire arent badryanairs hotel booking service is provided by booking com and its car hire by cartrawler com , which pays a commission to the airline we thought that might mean its cheaper to buy separately but when we tested prices for hotels in dublin for a weekend , we found that a stay at the jurys inn was actually cheaper through ryanairs website than anything we could find on comparison site trivago , while the cars were 1 2 less topicsconsumer affairssaving moneyryanairtravel leisurecheap flightsair transportfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

a wonderful and wide ranging discussion of an immensely complex and emotionally charged issue some final thoughts fighting corruption , forcing the hand of policy makers and developing community based responses to poverty are vital to elephant survivalhuman elephant conflict cannot be avoided , but we can try to control how humans reacta network of parks and wild lands is needed to allow elephants to roam naturallystamping out demand and the legal market in china is going to be difficult , but the government appears to be serioushope for the future is not lost , but it is probably limited to small pockets of land an entirely self indulgent question , i will admit , but thats my prerogative ! this excellent panel give us measured hope for the future wild60 22 november 2016 2 20pmin many countries i'm afraid it will not possible we often forget central and west africa where elephants are in many areas doomed if we cannot stop the current elephant poaching crisis , your grandchildren will probably be able to see wild elephants only in a handful of african countries , in the eastern and southern africa , tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 2 25pmyes , but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat poaching , build community support for conservation , reduce hec , reduce trafficking \( including through market closures \) , and dramatically reduce demand for ivory , the number of places with significant numbers of wild elephants , functioning as they should , will be very much smaller than now but there is real hope ! kenyadan 22 november 2016 2 30pmi think so karl , because high value tourism areas will be maintained they might be private , however , like ol pejeta and lewa in kenya unfortunately , in getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the wildlife you know what the word in english is for pest animals with no value vermin current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of rural african communities monicawrobel 22 november 2016 2 28pmkarl , i think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant specialists talking about the species , \( not just local abundant populations in one or two countries \) , we can get ivory under control and poaching significantly lessened and i strongly believe that if we do n't want simply islands of elephants but connected , migrating herds , we have to plan this now and in the next 5 10 years while we have something to work with this applies in asia too , where the iucn asian elephant specialist group just met last week for all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the question is back to you all , are you with us \? we need you to make your desire known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their habitat asian elephants are monica wrobel , whose organisation elephant family focuses on asian elephants paints a frightening picture of the future monicawrobel 22 november 2016 2 19pmin the past 100 years 90 of asian elephant populations have been wiped out without action , this iconic animal could be facing extinction within 3 decades , which is why this species is listed as endangered they now number as few as 40 , 000 across 13 countries in asia , with probably 60 occurring in india habitat loss \( lack of food \) and fragmentation of populations are causing declines , and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing them , as well as hunting \( sometimes for ivory though not all elephants have tusks and females do n't have tusks \) however , retaliatory killing for crop raiding such as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains wires , or setting out poison bait such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants have been reduced to crop pests , especially in places where people have settled and have no history of living with , or knowing how to live with elephants dan stiles also thinks things are looking bleak kenyadan 22 november 2016 2 16pmhabitat destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer it 's remarkable how well they 've done in india and sri lanka when you think of the population pressures unfortunately , it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase in india and carvers are still churning out the ganeshas and saraswatis i 've read how various states are planning corridors , etc heres what can be done says wrobel monicawrobel 22 november 2016 2 23pmin asia though , we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more where elephants need to move and what they need to eat we can lessen the interaction between people and elephants and help people co exist safely we can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are ready with the answers ! so there is hope , but we need to act now importantly , as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal poaching in africa , we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in africa to protect space and empower people to allow our spectacular , largest land mammal still have room to roam our biggest project at the moment with other ngos is our corridors campaign http elephant family org what we do campaigning 100 corridors on email , wim kerkhoven asks why we cant use funds from tourism to support local communities so they dont turn to poaching theres just not enough to go around , says andrea crosta wild60 22 november 2016 1 57pmthroughout africa there are working examples of involving local communities in the way you suggest , it 's simply a drop in the ocean there are million and millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually blessed with tourism and you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or brokers to create havoc there s a huge human toll behind the ivory trade and poor exploited people are a big part of it rahul raman 22 november 2016 2 02pmthats the same situation here , in india even with tourism , the number of poor people who actually benefit from it i e whose lives are uplifted by its effects is a very small number whatever the solution is , it has to be more though out and must benefit the poor community in large the money also fails to reach the communities says simon hedges simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 2 03pmsometimes the reason is that entrenched big businesses that are not set up to provide significant benefits to the local people in and around the eco tourism areas corruption is sometimes a problem too governments need to do more to support , facilitate , and otherwise help local initiatives and to require more equitable benefit sharing by the big operations you are correct to say that ecotourism in africa can generate 'big bucks' , see the paper i referenced earlier naidoo r , weaver c l , diggle r w , matongo g , stuart hill g thouless c \( 2015 \) complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal conservancies in namibia conserv biol monica wrobel says there is an important role for development aid to play to fill these gaps monicawrobel 22 november 2016 2 04pmi think community needs are greater than the support they are getting , especially in many african countries , but the rural poor in all countries where elephants range are too often left on their own in reality , the places where wildlife still exists are in places where the most dis enfranchised people live they may not even know when there is a government compensation scheme that can help them so i do n't think elephant populations always need to pay for themselves through trophy hunting or tourism income but i think that better access to development aid , or government aid or even an ngo started farming co op and access to markets can boost the morale and empowerment of communities those communities also do not want to be a target for criminal gangs preying on the unemployed to poach strong communities are a very important part of this answer , and support so they can use techniques or understand elephant routes help prevent human elephant interaction dan stiles says this is already underway in kenya kenyadan 22 november 2016 1 37pmthis is a critical question and in kenya right now there is a group doing exactly that , planning protected corridors to be left open to connect protected areas and private conservancies all range states should conduct such exercises , including cross border corridors and simon hedges agrees simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 1 53pmindeed ! elephants do need large areas of habitat and even in africa we are now seeing habitat fragmentation and loss become a significant problem for elephant conservation in asia , of course , habitat loss has long been one of the biggest threats to elephants , which are now largely confined to protected areas , many of which are too small for long term viability and have huge hec problems on their borders maintaining connectivity or restoring it if already lost is essential fortunately , as dan notes there are some encouraging examples from countries such as kenya and india but much more needs to be done in many more places for those feeling far away and helpless , here are some concrete actions you can take today monicawrobel 22 november 2016 1 36pmi agree with lobbying governments these should be considered world heritage animals and as global citizens we can help strengthen that argument and get more resources put towards forest and wildlife departments stronger departments aid better resource management , and not only help provide stability locally , but can stand up for protection of habitat for the good of communities and wildlife preventing environmental damage \( loss of forest , pollution , silting of rivers , floods , polluted water courses \) which de stabilises communities later i also endorse that people worldwide support the conservation organisations that can help direct research and aid to experts and communities for bringing about local solutions no , say most panelists although there are some caveats monicawrobel 22 november 2016 1 52pmi think the quote necessity is the mother of invention applies here some of the most innovative community schemes have come about when trophy hunting was not an option , and then other aid schemes and other government departments participated in community well being , not just under resourced wildlife departments dan stiles says it could work for some species but not elephants kenyadan 22 november 2016 1 47pmi'm not convinced that trophy hunting is essential to conserving elephants , at least elephant hunting , maybe other species it 's a complicated question andrea crosta from elephant action league says wild60 22 november 2016 1 43pmtrophy hunting is often the lazy answer of government that do not want to pro actively protect wildlife and provide local communities with real economic development simon hedges agrees its complicated but also perhaps an issue over egged by both advocates and critics , relative to its potential impact simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 2 15pmwhile i would personally never shoot an animal for its trophy there have been some successful examples of trophy hunting for some species generating revenues for and encouraging pro conservation attitudes among local people trophy hunting has the potential to provide those benefits in remote , difficult places where there are few other options for wildlife based landuses trophy hunting can therefore help keep significant areas of land under wildlife land that might otherwise not be so used but in some places trophy hunting operations have practised predator control , introduced species , or bred overly developed trophies all of which are bad for biodiversity conservation so , yes , it 's complicated it is also hard to see that trophy hunting is likely to ever play a significant role in elephant conservation the amount of money generated by trophy hunting is also small relative to the funding needs for conservation in africa , and so in some ways the heated debates post cecil are a distraction from the bigger issues see lindsey p a , balme g a , funston p j , henschel p h hunter l t b \( 2016 \) life after cecil channelling global outrage into funding for conservation in africa conservation letters 9 , 296 301 carey ostrer has asked via email how we go about fighting the illegal trade when it is so lucrative \? dan stiles responds kenyadan 22 november 2016 1 25pmon the demand side , where consumers buy , law enforcement in pretty much every country has proven ineffective if high demand prevails if shops are closed down , traders and consumers move to online websites and members only social media demand must be lowered , but this is a long process monica wrobel of elephant family points out monicawrobel 22 november 2016 1 26pmfrom the words of a wildlife enforcement specialist on illegal trade , investigation and enforcement is still woefully inadequate in the countries that matter \( range states and consumer transit countries \) there 's a need to recognise this is a crime problem and the response needs to be police led customs have demonstrated they have capacity , mandate and therefore little will to investigate the hundreds of ivory seizures made to date many techniques still are n't being adopted , such as controlled deliveries , forensic analysis of crime scenes for links to suspects , and lack of proactive responses sources within the trade have indicated that serious offenders are only afraid of imprisonment if actually prosecuted , yet such a deterrent barely exists and simon hedges of wcs adds simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 1 30pmdan is correct to stress the challenges inherent in demand reduction and there needs to be a much greater focus on effecting behavioural change not just raising awareness we have seen to little of the former in demand reduction campaigns to date but demand for wildlife products including ivory and rhino horn has been reduced in the past in a number of countries , so we know it can be done elephants are wild animals and so conflict is hard to avoid , according to the panel consultant dan stiles says we can only control how humans respond kenyadan 22 november 2016 1 28pmfor those who suffer the depredations of elephants , the only thing that has been demonstrated to prevent retaliation is if the people gain tangible benefits very few places have mechanisms in place for that now solutions have to involve communities , says wildlife directs trish sewe trishsewe 22 november 2016 1 34pmconflict between humans and wildlife cannot be avoided however solutions have to come from the people living with wildlife innovative ideas of how to live harmoniously ca n't take a top down approach and they have to build economic prosperity , says simon hedges in a comment too long to post so ill link to it here he also suggests further investigating insurance and other ways to manage or understand the impact on humans simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 1 42pmin addition to trying to ensure local people derive direct financial benefits from the presence of wildlife such as elephants whenever possible , a key part of mitigating human elephant conflict \( hec \) or human wildlife conflict \( hwc \) more generally is to adopt a sound evidence based approach to testing and promoting effective hec hwc reduction methods there are methods that can help reduce hec \( under some circumstances at least \) out there but they need to be deployed more effectively approaches such as insurance need to be further tested and developed too most panelists , including simon hedges from wcs , agree that the chinese mean it when they say they will phase out their legal ivory trade simonhedgeswcs 22 november 2016 1 15pmyes , i think the chinese government is serious about shutting down the domestic market in ivory in china that commitment was announced at the highest level in a joint communique from president xi and president obama in september 2015 earlier this year the chinese authorities said publicly that they would announce the timetable for implementing the ban , so we can expect to see that announcement soon but rahul raman points out that there has been little movement since they made their announcement a year ago rahul raman 22 november 2016 1 18pmwhile this is true , chinese govt has n't announced a date , even though hong kong has , which is 2020 can we be sure that china is serious about this , even after we now that officials from high office are involved in the trade \? but isabel hilton , of chinadialogue , points out the difficulty in enforcing laws in a country as vast as china isabelh1 22 november 2016 1 49pmre the ending of the domestic legal trade in china , whiles it will undoubtedly help we should also be aware that it is a recurring pattern in china that good laws can be passed but that enforcement failure can lead to unexpected results china often resists legislation for as long as possible , then acts when the diplomatic costs become too high but that is not the same as effective enforcement china is a very big country , beijing 's reach is less effective than many outsiders imagine , and enforcement may not be a priority if you look at the overall movements in demand , the relatively recent surge in demand from vietnam for both ivory and rhino horn i suspect that the bulk of both are being smuggled into china it 's a change of route rather than a drop in demand dan stiles , who works with the iucn elephant specialist group , believes some news might be imminent kenyadan 22 november 2016 1 54pmi 've heard they will announce the plan in december it will involve a phased closing , allowing ivory traders and factories to

but now new questions are arising how do governments go about shutting down the legal ivory market \? fighting an illegal ivory market could be even harder how do we strengthen forces against the

this bloodbath of an election , a friend emailed me like watching someone get murdered , another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the vietnam war the third vietnam draft dodger is now commander in chief welcome to the full flowering of the era of trump , which began with that now mytho epic glide down the escalator at trump tower , where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic words when mexico sends its people , theyre not sending their best theyre sending people that have lots of problems , and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some , i assume , are good people if ever a monument is erected to the trump presidency , then surely these words shades of gettysburg ! will be carved into the marble walls , along with blood coming out of her wherever , fifty bucks a steak and i would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding in true demagogic fashion , trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the gut , to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many civil , temperate americans hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own niceness , how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled up , years and years of internalized micro aggression from a culture that kept insisting on diversity , inclusiveness , tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these years , and to be free of it , freed from this code that was jamming us up \? that was relief akin to a lung puncturing primal scream from the start trumps rallies had the air of the tent revival , that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and ecstasy lets not fool ourselves , a friend wrote i cant stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a repub winning the election , which would be bad enough this is white supremacy winning calm down , were tempted to say its really not that bad stances are taken , things get said in the heat of a campaign , and we could take heart in the newly gracious , conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that steve bannon , the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to otis , the town drunk on the old andy griffith show , was named senior counselor and chief strategist for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term alt right , but we know already , we know , we know , we know white nationalism , aka honky purity \( dont dig too deeply into the family dna ! \) , along with thick , glistening lardings of apocalyptic racism , and a style sense that falls somewhere between springtime for hitler and queer eye for the straight guy prior to his gig on the trump campaign , bannon spent four years as chairman of breitbart news , which he proudly declared to be the platform for the alt right as breitbart chairman , bannon presided over such headlines as gabby giffords the gun control movements human shield , birth control makes women unattractive and crazy and , two weeks after a white nationalist murdered nine members of a bible study group at a black church in charleston , south carolina , hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage find myself not sleeping at night , a friend wrote the first president endorsed by the ku klux klan , noted another then there was obama being obama on the day after the election we have to remember that were actually all on one team a mans character is his fate , as heraclitus said , and what a strange , twisted fate indeed that barack obama cerebral , disciplined , cool , ever seeking to reconcile and accommodate \( as an african american pastor in charleston commented , once his presidency is over , obama will no longer have to be the least threatening black man in america \) has had to deal with an opposition that very much regarded him as not on the team there was the birther movement , for starters the closet muslim conspiracy theories the terrorist fist bump founder of isis teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner all this damage hes done to america is deliberate , said marco rubio during one of the republican debates , which is a laugh if obama wanted to trash the us , all he had to do on taking office in 2009 was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to oblivion but the issue is bigger than any particular president after his post election all on one team remark , obama continued the point , though , is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens , because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy this goes to the heart of the matter the american system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of power , the separation of powers and checks and balances that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early 1990s as gop leaders in congress , newt gingrich and tom delay chief among them , declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation democrats , in gingrichs world of moral absolutes , were the enemy of normal americans gingrich and his allies were fighting no less than a civil war with liberals , and as he declared in a speech to the heritage foundation , this war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil wars and so began the constitutional hardball and scorched earth tactics that have characterized the past quarter century of american politics you may recall the gingrich orchestrated government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995 96 over budget disputes , and the 1998 impeachment of bill clinton for lying about a blowjob in more recent times , there was the famous dinner at a washington fine dining steakhouse on the evening of 20 january 2009 the day of obamas inauguration at which gop congressional leaders \( along with gingrich , by then a highly paid k street lobbyist \) vowed to sabotage obamas presidency by opposing every item on the new presidents economic agenda at a time when 700 , 000 jobs a month were disappearing including those items previously supported or even proposed by the gop \( were all rooting for him , obama said of trump when they met recently in the oval office because if he succeeds , america succeeds \) senate republican leader mitch mcconnell later summed up the gop stance when he publicly stated , the single most important thing we want to achieve is for president obama to be a one term president burying obama was the goal , and if bringing him down required shredding the constitutional order , then to hell with the past 220 years of constitutional order the filibuster , once reserved for only the most major policy disputes , became mcconnells go to weapon , routinely deployed even for small bore matters by withholding funding or refusing to consider appointments to government posts , the senate effectively nullified laws that had been duly enacted in accordance with the constitution at a time when the federal courts had a record number of vacancies , scores of judicial seats went unfilled the current eight months and counting vacancy on the supreme court is merely the most high profile example government shutdowns and debt ceiling crises once unthinkable became so endemic that for the first time in its more than 150 year history , standard poors downgraded the credit rating of the us , citing the recent phenomenon of political brinkmanship even then , gop lawmakers have matter of factly continued to use the threat of government default as a bargaining chip , a nuclear option that , if carried out , would have catastrophic effects on the world economy had the founding fathers wanted gridlock , they wouldnt have replaced the articles of confederation with the constitution but gridlocks been great for the republican party , which has mastered a crude but so far effective trick campaign as the anti government party , on a platform decrying government as dysfunctional and ineffective , then once youre in power pull out all the stops to make sure government is dysfunctional and ineffective maybe this is why congress has lower approval ratings than cockroaches , head lice and zombies , and why mitch mcconnell has the perpetually serene look of a man who sleeps well at night those low approval ratings mean his side is winning that all this has happened at the expense of the constitutional order , and of the spirit of comity and good faith so necessary for the functioning of that order , seems not to trouble mcconnell or his colleagues in the least to call these people conservative is a joke they seek to precious little much more accurate to call them the wrecking crew on this grimmest of mornings and , the faces on the subway today , i will never forget the people want change can you blame us \? weve been sucking wind for 35 years while the 1 rides higher and higher , a trend that began with the reagan revolution , a sea change in american politics which the democratic establishment accepted all too readily it is the poorest people in the world who will pay for this , over and over trickle down economics , free trade , government is the problem , kick labor to the curb the whole supply side package became the default center of political debate , and the increasingly corporate dems offered less and less to working and middle class people as the years went by woke up at 3am thinking , ive failed my kids that the clinton campaign wrote off the white working class vote was not only a political failure , it was a moral failure as well , not to mention emblematic of the past several decades of democratic leadership tell her to go hang out with george w bush in hubris hell trumps campaign spoke to our economic fear and anger with a rawness that clintons didnt even try to match in hindsight , its no surprise that she lost the wisconsin and michigan primaries and very nearly the nomination to bernie sanders , a candidate who tapped into the same populist angst that would give trump no fewer than 290 electoral college votes though one wonders whether all those good working folks who voted for trump realized they were endorsing a huge tax cut for the 1 , and a candidate whose election left k street as giddy as a girl asked to the prom by the handsomest boy in school i wish i thought things would seem even slightly less terrifying in a day or month try some escapist literature i find detailed accounts of the first world war and disastrous arctic expeditions very readable at times like this this system we have , this free market system that grinds huge numbers of people into crumbs , it seems so vast and monolithic most of the time , an unstoppable machine steered by distant , mysterious forces trump seemed to offer a rare chance to throw a wrench into the works , and many took it that theres a much bleaker side to his victory racist , misogynist , xenophobic owes much to certain feelings and impulses that have been steadily nurtured over the years by the republican party if you have doubts about that , read up on the history of the gops notorious southern strategy old demons we thought wed pushed to the fringes , it turns out theyve been right here among us all along , biding their time , waiting for their hour to come around again thats the heartache and for many , more than heartache its a clear and present danger for a minute , tribal identity looked not to be everything fond little daydream nothing optimistic comes to mind , stunned beloveds trumps policy agenda , always a moving target on the campaign trail , is looking even more slippery in the days since the election the wall , that sturdiest beam in the trump platform , might be downgraded to a mere fence in certain areas signature features of the formerly horrible obamacare are actually good , and should remain and that massive deportation force \? maybe not so massive after all this sort of backstroking belies whats been obvious all along trump has never had much in the way of policy goals besides serving the greater good of trump ego will be the guiding principle of the trump presidency in this respect hes much more like a monarch than the duly elected public servant of a representative democracy , and , as monarchs do , he will keep his heirs close to the center of power , ivanka , don jr , eric , and that budding cardinal richelieu of a son in law , jared kushner top security clearances and advisory roles are contemplated for the kids , who at the same time will be running the for profit entities of the sprawling trump organization its hard to imagine a more ethically fraught , legally explosive situation for the children , managing a vast consortium of transnational businesses while being privy to the countrys most sensitive secrets , along with easy access to the most powerful man in the world how will it all play out \? badly look to shakespeare for a taste of the awful potential here , to the tragedies and history plays , those coils of ego and empire and wealth \( and sex and sex and sex ! \) that often end with bodies all over the place the best thing trump could do for his children would be to put his assets in a genuine blind trust , and send the kids away far , far away from washington to do their own thing limit visits to holidays and weekends , bounce the grandkids on his knee , not breathe a word about business or affairs of state but thats not how monarchies roll that trump would put his children in such a legally tenuous position gives us a clear idea as if we needed it from a man who used to rely on the infamous bottom feeder roy cohn for legal counsel of his appreciation for the rule of law here again we can expect the monarchical model people rarely grow in humility once they reach the white house to the extent trump attempts to game , spin and mutilate the rule of law , his most immediate potential check will be a congress thats firmly in republican hands , led by the same wrecking crew thats already shown such faint regard for the constitutional order , with a fire breathing rank and file think freedom caucus egging them on to new lows the institutions , structures and traditions of american governance are about to be tested as they havent

the 2016 presidential election took a heavy toll on the vast army of journalists assigned to cover it , grinding down shoe leather , fingertips and nerve endings in equal measure but for one reporter , daniel dale of the toronto star , the race for the white house was singularly burdensome , turning him into a night owl at the end of each long day on the campaign trail , he would take a deep breath and launch into his second job fact checking the lies of donald trump the work would begin late , often at 2am , when all was quiet and he could sink himself undisturbed into a hot bath of outrageous falsehood hed start by watching recordings of the rallies the republican candidate had addressed that day , scouring his words for deceits that ranged from the whopping \( i opposed the iraq invasion the election is rigged \) to the trivial \( the only way to pronounce nevada is nev ahh da , when in fact most people say nev add a \) then the reporter would scuttle through trumps twitter feed , followed by news outlets and search engines in the hope of catching every statement he made and testing them all for accuracy as the election approached , trumps untruths began to multiply , and with them dales nocturnal hours , until he was at it virtually all night after each of the three televised debates between trump and hillary clinton , and in the final frantic days of the campaign , he pulled all nighters before going straight back to his day job towards the end it was crazy , dale says the only thing that made it easier was that trump repeated himself we called him out for lying but he was so unresponsive he just kept saying the same things from 15 september until 8 november , dale recorded a total of 560 false trump statements , an average of about 20 a day as the sleep deprived reporter staggered into election day , he reflected that if his nighttime activities had reached even a small percentage of the american electorate , and helped them understand the fundamental mendacity of a candidate seeking the most powerful job on the planet , then it would have been worth it then came election night i was as shocked as many other journalists , dale says , recalling trumps steady march towards the 270 electoral votes needed to win despite his own extraordinary late night efforts despite the similarly herculean efforts of the new york times , which dedicated 18 journalists to fact checking the tv debates in real time , or of npr , which turned over 30 staffers to a similar endeavor despite the guardians lyin trump column and so much more , some 61 million americans were unfazed enough by the idea of a serial liar in the oval office to vote for him fact checking wasnt the only journalistic tool that was deployed in 2016 with what now appears to be limited effectiveness many observers assumed the washington posts thundering scoop of trumps hot mic remarks in which he boasted about grabbing women by the pussy , together with megyn kellys astonishing opening question at the first tv debate in which she reminded the candidate that he had called women fat pigs and dogs , would hand female voters , and thus the presidency , to clinton they didnt 53 of white women voted for trump , according to exit polls jorge ramos , the lead news anchor at univision , predicted on election day that trump would lose because he had turned his back on the spanish language media didnt happen almost one in three hispanics backed him , to ramoss bafflement accomplices or antagonists how the media handled the trump phenomenon read morenewspaper endorsements , those most portentous of journalistic institutions , also seemed to have little purchase on the outcome of this convention shattering election the nieman lab counted 360 titles that backed clinton , including the dallas morning news which sided with a democratic candidate for the first time since 1940 , and usa today which endorsed the first presidential candidate , period , in its 36 year history by contrast , trump drew a paltry 11 endorsements such overwhelming consensus from the nations press but was anybody listening \? put all these indicators together , and you start to wonder whether donald trumps unlikely victory has sounded the death knell for the influence and authority of what he and his supporters scathingly call the mainstream media did the msm , in particular cable tv which broadcast his every cough and spittle with almost obsessive dedication , help put him in the white house \? conversely , did the press go too far in abandoning its traditional even handedness and unrestrainedly attacking trump , as rightwing pundits are now suggesting \? looking forward , what will be the role of the established media as we head into the chilly waters of a choppy new era \? those are just some of the glaring questions left hanging at the end of an epically weird election season to begin poking some of those issues , the guardian has teamed up with the columbia journalism review \( cjr \) , a leading source of media criticism it has compiled a unique oral history of the 2016 election through the eyes of 40 of the top tv and press editors , reporters and columnists who helped shape and define the public perception of this years race the narrative runs to 11 , 000 words , with the guardian publishing an edited version of it one of the first big questions that cjrs oral history , in tandem with the guardians own exploration of the subject , throws up is the role of blanket tv coverage in the rise , fall and rise again of president elect trump ben smith , editor in chief of buzzfeed , was quick to spot earlier this year that trumps twitter feed acted not only as a powerful megaphone channeling his voice directly to his followers \( he had 13m of them on twitter on election day , as well as 12m on facebook \) , it also served as a news script for the cable channels trump would tweet out his latest offensive or aggressive tweet , often in the early hours of the morning , and tv news editors arriving at their desks would pick it up and turn it into ratings friendly headlines that would then go on to dominate the rest of the 24 hour news cycle facebook twitter pinterest guardian reporters reflect on challenges of covering 2016 us electionwhat typically drives tv is great reporting by newspapers instead , trump used his tweets as an alternative route to great journalism , and that turned out to have been a very big deal , smith told the guardian the tv channels feasted on tweeted trumpisms with an alacrity that many observers found disturbing according to a study by mediaquant , trump benefited from the equivalent of 5 2bn worth of free airtime from earned media , a quantity that the firms analysts said was almost surreal in sheer magnitude in return , cable channels enjoyed a massive ratings spike tv was convulsed by other controversies , notably cnns decision to employ trumps former campaign manager corey lewandowski while he was still receiving severance payments from his old boss , and the embarrassment \( also falling to cnn \) of democratic strategist donna brazile leaking questions from a town hall event in advance to the clinton campaign more red faces erupted at nbc when its access hollywood tape of trumps lewd comments about women was leaked to the washington post after the network appeared to dither over broadcasting it but these difficulties , humiliating at times though they were , pale in comparison with the overarching charge that tv and to a lesser degree the press was indiscriminate for far too long in its handling of trump , engaging with him more like the apprentice reality tv star that he was than the us president that he wanted to become during the primaries , cable news in particular cnn and fox , and to some extent msnbc gave trump unhealthily generous , inflated coverage that helped make him , says margaret sullivan , media columnist of the washington post it takes someone with the on the ground experience of john weaver , chief strategist to trumps rival john kasich during the republican primaries , to spell out the full impact of this media binge on the election he believes it actively distorted the process , and even now , six months after kasich dropped out of the race , you can still hear the fury in weavers voice i hope theres some deep introspection at the networks and cable channels over the billions of dollars of free coverage they gave to donald trump , often without holding him accountable for his bizarre claims he is judged by such a low standard by many of the news media , its troubling to me the sense that the media allowed itself to be taken for a ride by the trump campaign in exchange for stellar ratings came to a crunch on 16 september in washington dc by now enshrined as republican nominee , trump lured the pack of political reporters to a press conference by promising to make a statement an apology , it was assumed about his long held and oft repeated birther lie about president obama having been born outside the us the location for the event happened to be the old post office on pennsylvania avenue that trump had just renovated into a luxury hotel for 26 minutes he subjected the media , and through them the american people , to a succession of unctuous speeches by retired military leaders singing the candidates praises then , when trump finally got round to issuing a 21 word rebuttal of his own false birther theory , he prefaced it with yet another lie that hillary clinton was responsible for having started the toxic rumor in the first place it was vintage trump almost a half hour of free advertising not only for his presidential campaign but also for his new hotel handed to him on a plate by the cable networks in exchange for a 30 second non apology that made false accusations against his opponent nothing new there , then what was new was the response of the assembled media crowd who had been forced to sit through the ordeal , cameras rolling , keyboards rattling , as though they were so many of trumps dutiful playthings it was a political rick roll fumed cnns jake tapper , referring to the rick astley internet meme , while john king on the same channel lamented we got played again jay rosen , who teaches journalism at new york university and whose blog pressthink org has been a widely cited resource on the fraught relationship between trump and the press in 2016 , sees the dc hotel debacle as a seminal moment thats when people in the campaign press corp got disgusted not just with trumps mendacity and manipulation but at themselves for playing along with it that turned the worm it was an important turning point , agrees kyle pope , cjrs editor and publisher its when reporters said , no more , thats it , enough the response from the new york times was decisive and swift as its political editor carolyn ryan related to a recent cjr roundtable of media executives , she immediately approached the papers executive editor i went to dean baquet and i said , can we call this the unwinding of a lie \? he understood the potency of coming out very directly and saying that , and that what trump had done a willful deceit was far more egregious than some of the fabrications and stretching of the truth that we usually see in politics so he was firmly behind us the resulting piece by michael barbaro marked in itself a seminal moment for the times newsroom , which as ryan pointed out is a fairly traditional institution that until recently struggled with the idea of calling a lie a lie yet in this case the editorial decision to do just that abandoning any attachment to the on the one hand this , but on the other hand that school of journalism came quickly and easily we decided in about 40 minutes , ryan said there has been a lot of discussion this election cycle about how trumps insurgent campaign , its asymmetry as rosen has put it , has shaken up many of the time honored rituals and false equivalencies of political journalism adam moss , new york magazines editor in chief , makes clear that his magazine consciously decided to ditch the journalistic habits of a lifetime we dont pretend to objectivity , but we do , as a rule over the years , try to maintain some kind of even handedness we abandoned that because we felt the threat of his candidacy and presidency was too great the counterpoint to that is that several of the contributors to the cjr oral history express regret that , at least at the outset , the coverage of real estate businessman was seriously flawed , as jorge ramos puts it the billionaire was underestimated as a candidate , and as a result treated initially as a bit of a joke laura mcgann , a politics editor for vox , bravely admits feeling guilty that she assigned a deep dive into trump soon after he launched his campaign in june 2015 to a \( very good \) intern , adding i regret not taking him more seriously a year ago than i did but buzzfeeds ben smith makes the point that , important though such post election soul searching is , it should not obscure the fact that there was plenty of hard hitting reporting done even early on the washingon post , new york times , we at buzzfeed , politico , the guardian and many more , gave a thoroughly detailed account of him anyone who was surprised by the person who emerged during the campaign really wasnt paying attention you only have to credit a tiny portion of the highlights of the coverage this cycle to see how impressive much of it was mckay coppins seminal romp with trump all the way back in 2014 susanne craigs heaven sent package in her times mailbox containing the billionaires leaked tax returns david fahrenthold of the posts work on the trump foundation and his groping scoop ari berman of the nations probe into the real rigging of the election guardian columnist lucia graves interviews with women alleging the candidate sexually assaulted them so what happened to all this solid work \? why did it appear to go up in a puff of smoke on election night \? there is a separate and febrile debate over whether or not opinion polls were in part to blame for giving the impression that the white house was in the bag for clinton , but many other theories are circulating one prevalent idea , as hadas gold of politico tells cjr , is that the media did its job but the public just did not care the new york times political reporter jonathan martin offers an opposite conclusion that the coverage did hit home with voters , as reflected in trumps historically bad popularity ratings to which it might be added that hillary clinton is still winning in the popular vote a third line of inquiry that is likely to run and run is whether the media , in its coastal bubble , failed to get to grips with the anger that was brewing right under its nose in the american heartlands a flick of that argument was given in the missive sent by arthur sulzberger and baquet , publisher and executive editor of the new york times , to their readers soon after the election did donald trumps sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among american voters \? answering his own question , baquet told the guardian us that the times did in fact write extensively about anger in america in the run up to the election , but adds that its a good idea as an editor to be humble enough to ask oneself what questions should have been asked during the campaign nobody , including the trump campaign itself , quite understood the forces that would lead to donald trump being elected in what everybody agrees was a surprise a big part of my job now is to explain that in the coming months , to go out in the country , talk to people who feel anxious about the future of the country , dont caricature them , let them speak just let them talk a more disturbing thought is that while many news outlets took great efforts to chronicle the plight of the white working classes in middle america , their dispatches didnt register with millions of voters for the simple reason that those voters werent reading any of us amid the ongoing muscle of drudge , the new transcendence of breitbart , not to mention the proliferation of fake news sites , conservative americans and for that matter liberals are increasingly able to receive information from within their own alternative bubble where their opinions are reinforced without being challenged by the loathed msm one of the more despairing expressions of this theory was given by new york magazines adam moss to cjr the media as it used to be thought of is just not that important any more it doesnt matter that some people were doing good work because were just talking to ourselves and people who already agree with us since trumps victory , another theory has been aired increasingly by right of center pundits such as howard kurtz of fox news that flips the argument that the media did too little too late to expose trump on its head in this iteration , major outlets did too much , were too eager to go after him the editor of the wall street journal , gerard baker , tells cjr that some reporters saw it as their role to stop this man from becoming president , they put themselves in the role of partisans it fell to piers morgan of mail online , as it often does , to put the case most stridently the nyts ludicrously biased anti trump barrage of bile helped him get elected thats ridiculous , ripostes the times dean baquet we didnt cover donald trump any more aggressively than we covered hillary clinton people forget that we broke the story of clintons emails if both sides think you were tough on them , maybe that means you were fair of all the mainstream media bashing that has been unleashed since 8 november , one source of it stands head and shoulders above the rest donald trump himself which is not surprising , given his track record during the campaign reporters deemed to be producing unfavourable copy were punished by trump jorge ramos was ejected from a press conference after the univision anchor dared to ask an awkward question coppins was turned away from trump rallies as comeuppance for his caustic 2014 profile a lengthening list of other media outlets were banned by the campaign individual journalists were targeted for bullying , such as nbc newss katy tur supporters at campaign stops were enabled to turn in anger against camera operators just doing their jobs , screaming cnn sucks ! cnn sucks ! cnn sucks ! since trumps metamorphosis into president elect , the tendency to target the media has only got worse now he routinely gives the press pool the slip , showing contempt for both transparency and tradition back on his android phone , trump is on the failing new york times warpath , displaying a sort of frenzied disdain that hardly bodes well for the relationship between soon to be president and the countrys paper of record ive never seen anything quite like this , says baquet , who as former editor of the los angeles times and washington bureau chief of the times has seen more than most i dont think weve ever had a president elect tweeting about us , thats for sure as 20 january 2017 and the start of his presidency bears down upon us , much of the media will enter the trump era carrying with them a profound sense of trepidation this is a moment of high danger for the press were heading into a dark period for american democracy and american journalism , says jay rosen of nyu jorge ramos tells cjr i think well remember this election as unique and very concerning for the future of the press because if this becomes the norm , we are in serious trouble its not just the lack of access , mocking and bullying that can be expected from president trump theres also the internal danger that the media will normalize his time in office under the cloak of traditional reverence for the presidency contributors to the cjrs account of 2016 point out that a pattern of normalization was established even on the campaign trail , when media outlets appeared to be willing trump on to elevate himself from his startlingly unconventional approach to a proper presidential mode in the memorable description of tommy craggs , slates politics editor , the candidate could have gone up there and danced the hoochie coochie and they would have said , this is a welcome change in tone from donald trump since the election that trend has thickened , some believe john weaver , the former chief strategist for trumps republican rival john kasich , says he is outraged by media references to steve bannon , the breitbart chairman who trump has appointed his senior counselor in the white house , as a controversial figure or an aggressive conservative no , no , thats sugar coating he was the publisher of the news site that he said was home to the alt right , and that is code for racism and sexism and fascism , weaver said so what will be the role of the mainstream media as it embarks , somewhat battered but still standing , into trumps america \? will it be to document the new administration with a detached and objective eye , as traditional newsroom canons dictate , or will it pursue that other burning function of the fourth estate , holding power to account \? we will cover him fairly and aggressively , and we will not let his criticism of us sway us or keep us from doing what we have to do , says dean baquet of the new york times in my mind our mission is clearer than its ever been we have to cover the giant story of this extraordinary white house , which is going to change american politics and policy for years to come , as aggressively ,

morewhether soccer in the us wants or needs promotion and relegation is a debate that pulses as one of the pressure points of operating a global sport in north america , where some fans envy the dramas elsewhere but major leagues have heavily centralised structures , clubs are franchises and professional soccers rulers have an aversion to risk informed by memories of the old nasls rise and fall in the 1970s and 80s the topic was given fresh impetus by mondays release of a report from deloitte which contends that reworking the us soccer pyramid to introduce promotion and relegation could stimulate changes that would benefit the sport from top to bottom the report argues that it would increase attention , translating to higher attendance and broadcast viewing figures force owners to work harder to improve their teams and infrastructure battle harden players in a way that would aid development all the way to national team level bring the us in line with overseas leagues and lead to stronger structures and more investment from the grassroots up the study commissioned by silva international investments , whose head , riccardo silva , co owns the nasls miami fc includes a survey of us fans which found that 88 believe that pro rel would boost american club soccer i do think that for the game to realise its full potential in the us , promotion and relegation feels like part of the solution , said dan jones of deloittes sports business group we very deliberately havent put a timeline on it because theres a lot of practical detail to be worked out as to how you would actually go about implementing it that would include stabilising and organising the lower leagues and creating a compensation package palatable to mls clubs who endure relegation , as well as figuring out how to handle the increasing number of lower league teams affiliated to mls sides but with expansion fees now in excess of 100m , providing a key revenue generator for a league that last year claimed to be losing money , it is hard to imagine mls would give away spaces for free and the commissioner , don garber , dismissed the concept as recently as this month charleston battery has won four usl championships so i suppose in one way if you look at it we could have been promoted four times , said andrew bell , whose own career trajectory is a testament to american social mobility he started off as a taxi driver after emigrating to south carolina from england , joined the team in 1999 as a play by play announcer and was named president in 2008 the battery , of the third level united soccer league , have one of the best stadiums in the lower echelons and last year beat houston dynamo of mls in a pre season friendly bell knows the pain of relegation and the joy of promotion he is a boyhood fan of reading fc but he does not think the us is ready for it i think theres a realism that its really not going to happen any time soon , in my opinion maybe im wrong but i just cant see how we could change the system where that could be possible , he said weve been playing since 1993 , mls has been playing since 1996 , its really not that long so maybe in the future its going to be the long term future theres a chance that it could change and we could see that but i dont think were really at that mature level yet with mls on a solid footing and out of its teenage years , though , some believe that continued progress requires dramatic change , rather than a cautious ethos that has fostered incremental growth there is an incredible market for pro soccer in the us it is presently reined in by an uncompromising major league system that served its purpose well during the initial phase but 20 years later needs to evolve as it is now holding the growth back , said jerome de bontin , the former general manager of the red bulls , by email soccer fans like the european style pure merit system us tv audiences of european leagues are there to demonstrate that the us fans like the competitiveness of those leagues the us soccer fan is not different from the european one he or she aspires to the same quality and competitiveness of games the mls playoff attendance and tv ratings demonstrate that currently there is very little interest in the playoff system thats in place , which by the way , mls has changed many times over the past twenty years , without ever finding a formula that works if mls does ever adopt pro rel , it would likely only happen once the concept has proven successful in the lower echelons a test case is the united premier soccer league , an amateur competition in california , arizona , colorado , nevada and idaho with about 50 teams it will debut pro rel internally in 2017 we have some very good teams that have potential to be higher level teams in the future , said the upsl commissioner , yan skwara promotion will be based on a combination of on field performance and off field minimum standards , such as venue size if it is popular , teams might one day transit between tiers , skwara said , with a goal to connect the dots not only with just the clubs but with the leagues the system here is very fragmented and there are a handful of leagues and now its to the point where its a little bit confusing maybe it can help bring it all together in the future and maybe not , maybe everybody kind of stays their own course had the governing body , the united states soccer federation , taken a firmer grip of the structure long ago , skwara said , a more clearly defined structure that would have better facilitated pro rel might exist you have the wild wild west as far as leagues go you have a bunch of businesses that are set up to own and operate soccer leagues , he said theres nothing wrong with that but thats just the reality , that you have business opportunities to own and operate a league if you want to go and set up a league tomorrow you can do that , its not that difficult thats not the case in england or germany or poland , where the federation pretty much controls everything ultimately , of course , money will talk jones , of deloitte , questions the notion that american dealmakers fear volatility one of the points that some people have made to me is , well , us investors would not go for a system with the risk of relegation you look at it , and the fact that us investors invested in derby county , bologna , and swansea , and crystal palace so that doesnt say to me that us investors are unwilling to invest in a soccer system that carries the risk of relegation , he said it somehow just feels very in line with the american way of doing things that there would be that opportunity that if youre willing to commit time and money and talent and ambition into doing something , you could push that on as far as those factors will take you rather than hitting a false sort of glass ceiling quite early topicsmlssportblogus sportsfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via

hello i just found out that i am four weeks pregnant i cannot carry on with this pregnancy for numerous reasons and i want to have an abortion though it is an option for me in the united states , in reality , it is not really an option because the 600 700 to have it done is simply out of the question im hoping you can advise me and are able to help i am absolutely desperate martina read through her email once again and hovered her finger over the send button the message was addressed half a world away to women on web , a dutch not for profit group that mails abortion drugs to pregnant women who live in countries where abortion is outlawed martina lives in texas , where abortion is restricted but legal making it one of the places where women on web refuses to mail the drugs still , martina thought she would try her luck she had lost her job to downsizing , and in its place she had found only part time work her rent had gone up lately , she was borrowing money for gas there was no question that she couldnt afford to have a child the question was whether she could even afford an abortion martina had an inkling that what she was asking for help performing her own abortion might not be fully legal but she was out of answers she hit send then she began to case the internet for other ways she could cause her own abortion if this scene feels out of place in 2016 , that may be because there was a time in this countrys history when thousands of back alley and coat hanger abortions prompted calls for the procedure to be legal after the us supreme court established a right to a legal abortion , in the 1973 decision roe v wade , self induced abortions were supposed to become a thing of the past but almost as soon as the court legalized abortion , opponents of abortion rights began to whittle them away congress began prohibiting poor women from using medicaid to cover abortions in september 1976 obamacare , the largest healthcare expansion in decades , allowed insurers to continue to pick and choose the circumstances under which they would cover abortion and allowed states to ban the coverage altogether the two decisions have ensured that millions of women who have sought an abortion have had to pay for it out of pocket and a sweeping wave of anti abortion laws has closed clinics in many states , cresting with an awesome force over the last five years in such a hostile climate , it is no wonder that self induced abortions are still a significant , if largely hidden phenomenon one that even pro abortion rights groups are only just beginning to grasp one study of abortion patients found that 2 2 had tried to , at some point in their lives , induce their own abortions without professional medical assistance another estimated that potentially 4 1 of texas women have tried to self induce or at least 100 , 000 women its kind of kept under the radar , hushed , so it needs to be talked about martinathere is no concrete data on how many women in the us have tried to self induce but there is some evidence although it is inconclusive to suggest that self abortion attempts are on the rise from 2008 to 2011 , as the economy worsened and a wave of new restrictions choked abortion access around the country , online queries about self induced abortion almost doubled , according to seth stephens davidowitz , an economist who analyzes google searches into this crisis of reproductive rights now walks donald trump as president , trump has promised to restrict abortion even further he has vowed to nominate justices to the supreme court who might overturn roe v wade roe , because the court is loath to reverse itself , has survived such threats before but trump has explicitly promised to nominate justices who might put roe in their crosshairs in his first major interview after winning office , trump described truthfully what might happen to some women if roe v wade were overturned theyll perhaps have to go , theyll have to go to another state , he said and thats ok \? he was asked trump replied , well , well see what happens but we dont have to wait and see what happens history has already shown us what happens when women in the us cant access abortion so has the present day in 2015 alone , women on web , the dutch not for profit , received more than 600 emails from us women looking for a way to end their own pregnancies \( the group does not send abortion drugs to the us , because the us does not outright ban abortion \) women on web agreed to share scores of these emails with the guardian , providing an unprecedented window into the lives of women who feel they have no other option but to end their pregnancies themselves among the hundreds who wrote to women on web was martina she contacted the guardian shortly after she found out about her unwanted pregnancy and shared every step of her journey , which eventually took her across an international border \( as corroboration , she provided photographs , including of her travel documents her name has been changed for her privacy \) she wasnt sure if she faced a potential legal risk and in fact , self induction is in a legal gray area , and many enterprising prosecutors have charged women who carried out their own abortions with crimes nevertheless , martina felt compelled to speak i feel like theres such a negative stigma to this , she said its kind of kept under the radar , hushed , so it needs to be talked about people needed to know , she added , that abortion restrictions had real victims youre not really helping anyone youre not really protecting anyone youre just causing women who are in these situations who feel desperate to take desperate measures the letters to women on web form a uniform chorus of desperation please and afford and help and fear appear in dozens of places , signaling the nature of how these women became stranded now he is threatening me , saying i can never leave i am afraid of what he is capable of for a variety of reasons , an abortion must look like a miscarriage this has to look like a miscarriage i dont have 600 planned parenthood wants 650 my bf and i live in our car i cant afford an abortion i simply cannot afford an abortion a teenager in a state where minors need parental consent for an abortion said her parents were forcing her to have her baby a woman in missouri wrote to say that she had gone to her states only abortion clinic , but the protestors shamed me into going back im not a citizen and its a little scary coz i feel very lonely i am beside myself , read another womans email one month before she wrote her email , she was raped she received her coverage through tricare , the insurance plan for military personnel and their families tricares policy is to cover abortion in cases of rape as long as a doctor has a good faith belief that the rape occurred , according to a spokesman but this woman wrote that tricare refused to pay for her abortion on the basis that she never reported the rape to end this nightmare , she wrote , it would cost me one third of my familys monthly income she continued , i have seen a doctor i have had a sonogram tricare covers that i can give birth to my rapists baby for free please i am out of options , the letters read can u please please please please i cry and pray every night that the lord take this child from me somehow i will keep searching online for help what is striking about reading these emails one after another after another is the diversity of experiences that lead all these women down the same path there are homeless women and middle class women and married women and single women , women living in cities and women separated from the nearest abortion provider by an ocean two wrote in from the big island of hawaii , where the last clinic , a planned parenthood in kailua kona , closed in 2014 when people think about low income women seeking abortion , they have this stereotypical vision of a single woman on welfare , said laurie bertram roberts , head of the mississippi reproductive freedom fund her group provides financial assistance for abortions but its also people who have two jobs six hundred dollars is a lot of fucking money for a lot of the people who call us not a majority , but many those barriers are just too high even with our help women on web wrote back to martina a few hours after she sent her message were sorry , the reply came , women on web cannot provide the service in any country with safe abortion services the email listed a few not for profit abortion funds martina could call for financial assistance then it recommended another option if you live close to mexico you can also travel to mexico to buy misoprostol , a drug that can induce a miscarriage early in a pregnancy it sounded like a gamble martina felt a jolt of fear what if its incomplete \? what if i do it wrong \? what if i fuck up my organs somehow \? she pushed these thoughts aside at least it was an option martina learned that her insurance would not cover her abortion and left messages with two abortion funds she also found a world of websites describing ways to induce abortions with herbs or vitamins following advice from the sources that looked the most reputable , she began taking cinnamon capsules and several thousand milligrams of vitamin c per day its not unheard of for women to turn to herbal concoctions , reproductive rights advocates said its considered an ok thing to do this is just how theyve handled it for years , said esther priegue , the director of counseling at choices womens medical center , an abortion clinic in queens her patients occasionally use an herbal brew to try to induce a miscarriage the internet resounds with such recipes what you probably have , in reality , is hundreds of people doing it hundreds of different ways , said beverly winikoff , the president of gynuity health projects , a reproductive rights research group the way its always been of course , there werent supposed to be hundreds of different ways self induced abortion was supposed to have all but disappeared after the supreme court established the right to an abortion throughout the country in the run up to roe v wade , in the late 1960s and early 1970s , abortion was restricted to a handful of major cities and the women with the means to travel there roughly 100 , 000 women crossed state lines for a legal abortion in new york state in a single year , the number of women going to illegal providers or trying to self induce was up to 12 times that some years , up to 200 women would die of complications from illegal or self induced abortions and compared with the number of women who survived horrific complications , that figure appears small in 1968 alone , a single los angeles county hospital treated 701 women suffering from septic abortions if its not available , if a woman really does feel that she needs to terminate her pregnancy , she may be willing to try just about anything dr jason doebut just a few years after roe , the country seemed to vanquish the coat hanger abortion in 1976 , the centers for disease control announced that only three women had died the previous year from abortion complications a stunning reduction in deaths when anti abortion activists accused the centers of undercounting , the cdc , according to the book inside the outbreaks , put up a 100 bounty for proof of any abortion death the centers had failed to report we paid out zero money , one official recalled proudly but others realized that , even though women were no longer dying in scandalous numbers , illegal and self induced abortions were still a serious problem the cdc announcement came out the same year dr jason doe began to do his medical residency in the remote north west corner of louisiana , he rotated through an obstetrics ward that received many of the areas most impoverished residents the states only abortion clinic stood in the opposite corner of the state so even though abortion technically was legal for those women , it wasnt available , doe said one of his first patients had unraveled a wire coat hanger and used it to break her water another broke her water with a red rubber catheter her friend had stolen from a hospital does memory of another patient is dominated by her screams as she seized in pain , doctors removed an intact cotton boll the husk was still attached from her vagina she had soaked the cotton fibers in turpentine and honey in three years , i suppose i saw a dozen cases , said doe \( doe agreed to speak only under a pseudonym he works as an abortion provider in shreveport and has kept his identity hidden from the public \) he treated women who had gone to back alley abortion providers and a woman who had shot herself in the stomach turpentine became a kind of harrowing motif one woman used a syringe to inject it into her abdomen the tide only ceased in 1980 , when two abortion clinics opened a few months apart in nearby bossier city and shreveport roe v wade was seven years old just making it legal is not enough , doe said if its not available , if a woman really does feel that she needs to terminate her pregnancy , she may be willing to try just about anything his were not isolated experiences in 1977 , rosie jimenez became one of the first women to die from an illicit abortion after roe v wade jimenez had previously had one legal abortion , paid for using medicaid but in 1976 , congress passed the hyde amendment , which banned the use of federal medicaid funds to pay for abortion and which many advocates still consider the countrys biggest barrier to abortion access today the next time jimenez became pregnant , she sought out an unlicensed midwife in mcallen , texas she died of a bacterial infection in fact , nearly every year after roe v wade brought isolated reports of a woman taking drastic steps to terminate her pregnancy 1978 three young women in colorado poisoned their livers by drinking tiny amounts of aromatherapy oil to try to induce an abortion 1984 a teenager injected herself with a local anesthetic and attempted to cut out her fetus 1994 a florida teenager placed a pillow over her abdomen and shot herself in the side earlier this month , a woman in tennessee was charged with aggravated assault for trying to give herself an abortion with a coat hanger she was found out after profuse bleeding sent her to the emergency room it is against this backdrop of tragedies that some reproductive rights activists have argued for making the same abortion drugs used routinely in clinics available to women in their homes it would be phenomenal if people could receive this medication in the mail with all the instructions and the right safety measures , said yamani hernandez , the executive director of the national network of abortion funds already , she added , the internet is allowing untold numbers of to find and use the drug without medical supervision among the 700 , 000 searches on self abortion stephens davidowitz identified in 2015 , some 160 , 000 were searches for a way to obtain the abortion pill through back channels is there a chance those searches could increase under a trump presidency \? yes , said hernandez that is something that one could reasonably predict in an environment where abortion becomes even illegal , or even more inaccessible than it has been we will do anything in our power to get people the information and the care that they need even now , her group posts instructions for self administering misoprostol on its website for safetys sake not all advocates feel good about disseminating this information but they consider it better than the alternatives recently , roberts answered one of the scariest calls of her advocacy career a young woman was on the line , saying her friend had given her a home remedy her friend claimed to have used this method to end four separate pregnancies , even though each time it sent her to the hospital ultimately , we helped this woman go to a clinic before she could do something dangerous , roberts said her friend had told her to drink turpentine with sugar at a crisis pregnancy center , an ultrasound confirmed that martinas home remedies hadnt worked she was still pregnant the distress must have shown on her face , because the technician offered a flurry of reassurances they see a lot of single moms who do it on their own they have a store that sells baby clothes at a markdown they help with discounts on daycare martina fumed a baby is more than just buying clothes and food , she thought in her head , she was already reviewing her plan she had heard back from only one abortion fund , which had turned her down for assistance because she had a job and so , for a quarter of what a us abortion clinic would charge , she had purchased a flight to mexico city the flight left the next day she would stay with a friend abortion pills would cost about 20 at a pharmacy if she could find a pharmacy that carried the drug and would sell it to a young woman then , she would take the drugs at her friends house im gonna say like , oh man , im on my period , im so sorry , i hate that this is ruining the trip , i feel so sick , she said , sounding perfectly unrehearsed its kind of like when youre drowning if you just flap around , youre just going to drown but if you focus on what the goal is , on what you need to do , stay calm , thats how youre going to survive martinamartina had relied on this kind of subterfuge for the past several weeks friends had noticed she was distracted her boss had noticed she was nauseous this whole time that ive been pregnant , and that ive known ive been pregnant , thats all ive thought about , she said ive almost cried like five times today but you have to push that aside and act like youre fine , she said oh yeah , im sorry , i was zoned out for a sec oh yeah , sorry , just not feeling great the more difficult challenge was hiding her pregnancy from her boyfriend she knew he would want to start a family at home , she was taking so much anti nausea medication to keep from vomiting in front of him that she no longer had enough to sustain her through the work day you feel alone , but you cant do anything about it , she said i just kind of have to put my feeling outside of it you need to focus what do you need to do in order to move forward \? its kind of like when youre drowning if you just flap around , youre just going to drown but if you focus on what the goal is , on what you need to do , stay calm , thats how youre going to survive it was the sixth pharmacy martina went to in mexico that sold her the misoprostol the first five , a mix of big national chains and mom and pop shops , claimed they didnt carry it she felt at least one pharmacist was lying to her finally , she returned to the first store to ask , if not here , where could she buy it \? a little while later , she paid 26 for a blue carton about the size of her hand misoprostol , it said it wasnt an exciting feeling , holding the box it was scary , martina said its just like a god i just want to get this over with feeling she was still too nauseous to take the pills while she was in mexico city , so she would have to take them in the united states it was a panicky moment , bringing pills back through customs but there was a larger fear my biggest concern is , what happens if someone finds out \? what happens if something goes wrong \? martina had said a few days earlier what happens if my body doesnt completely rid itself \? in most abortion clinics , she knew , a medication abortion was induced with two drugs one drug to terminate the pregnancy , and misoprostol to expel the pregnancy she would only be taking the misoprostol so basically , youre half assing the job she knew what symptoms would tell her something had gone wrong but still theres just so many questions i would so much rather have a health professional help me in this and kind of guide me through it versus diy theres some things arent meant for that , and this is definitely one of them it is impossible to know what happened to all the other women who reached out to women on web but a study of women who were rejected because they were past the clinics gestational limit found that most of them carried their pregnancies to term roberts , the mississippi activist , said that many women who struggle to pay for an abortion eventually get creative not long ago , she spoke to a mother who was weighing whether to raid her diaper fund to pay for her abortion it was unlikely her parents would lend her money for an abortion , she reasoned , but they would probably help her buy more diapers there are no more creative problem solvers , and i mean this , than women with no money , she said and im saying that with the utmost respect , because there are people who will think of all this as shady and im not ive seen people struggling , and being brilliant , brilliant , in coming up with ways to survive its a skill she fears more women might need in the future martinas trip had cost a fraction of the money she needed to raise for an abortion in a us clinic something her mind was still trying to grasp the whole time i was traveling , i couldnt believe it was happening , she said we were speaking a few days after she returned from mexico an ultrasound had just confirmed that she was no longer pregnant , and her voice was sunny i am so relieved , to be honest she hadnt realized , until she was no longer pregnant , how much stress she had placed on herself now , she felt like she could breathe , she said like she could step back on the path of her life and figure out where she had been when she diverged martina had taken the pills on a saturday she took the first dose she set a timer on her phone then she took the second dose the pills worked just like they were supposed to she bled , but not too much she felt the pregnancy pass she felt exhausted and then it was done topicsdiy abortion in americawomenfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on

a few years ago , yahoo chief executive marissa mayer hit the headlines concerning a confidential memo shed sent to employees the message seemed to go against everything we know about how a high tech , post industrial economy operates from now on , everyone must be present and accounted for at the office working from home is prohibited the memo was carefully worded in the language of collegiality and staff development but employees understood its real meaning if we cant see you , we dont trust you it wasnt surprising that yahoo staff were annoyed weve known for years that employees are much more productive if theyre able to harness the freedoms that mobile technology can afford being chained to an office can be counter productive in many occupations employees feel hard done by and fight back as result , and rather ironically , we see the spread of bossesmany business commentators believed that yahoo was an exception in this regard , swimming against the tide of management wisdom in this rich information age then other stories started to emerge that seemed to indicate a sea change investigative reporters at the new york times in 2015 revealed the shocking techniques used by amazon to manage its office workers you thought its warehouse workers were harassed wait until you join hq absolutely everything is monitored , even the time it takes to answer an email fear and intimidation soon became rife in the office , transforming the annual performance review into a daily event , as one stressed employee lamented worse was still to come employees at the telegraph recently discovered heat and motion sensors that tracked whether they were at their desks there was no warning employees simply found the devices on monday morning they eventually had to google the brand name to identify what they were a memo was issued at lunchtime by senior management stating that the new policy was to make sure we are making best use of our space in the building none of this sits very well with the official knowledge society narrative old school hierarchies are meant to be dead and buried authoritarian micro managers have no place in industries that need workers to use their initiative , share ideas , be creative and excel at self management flat company structures and autonomy are the future back in the 1990s , business guru tom peters even heralded the end of management what to do if you have a difficult boss read moreso what happened \? why does it feel like there are more bosses now than ever telling us what to do , often adopting a needlessly authoritarian tone \? to answer the question we need to remember where the idea of management comes from sure , managers help co ordinate things big organisations need administrators but the modern manager was actually invented in the early us steel industry and with a specific rationale one of the first management consultants , fredrick winslow taylor , deplored how much control average employees had over their jobs he didnt trust them , and if there was a dispute theyd always have the upper hand so something had to change taylor recommended that all knowledge about a job be transferred to a new breed of managers who watch staff like hawks , often with a stopwatch in their hand he drove the point home enthusiastically , to the extent that workers began to complain that it was hindering their work , not helping them yes , management was actually getting in the way that was more than 100 years ago when employers were perhaps less enlightened so what about now \? why are we seeing the same heavy handedness reappear in many post industrial occupations , including journalism , the it sector , retail , universities and so forth \? there are a number of forces in action first , were often told that workers are happier if hired on a flexible basis , be it as contractors or self employed this may suit some but research shows pdf that poorer pay and conditions often increase discontent and disengagement employees feel hard done by and fight back as result , and rather ironically , we see the spread of bosses precisely in those industries we would expect to see fewer theyre hired to keep a lid on the seething dissatisfaction caused by zero hours and uber ised jobs the second driver is inequality the greater the division between those at the top and the bottom of any hierarchy , then the more monitoring and supervision well see thats because rising perceptions of injustice make conflict and non compliance more likely at the societal level , for example , its no coincidence that the increasing wealth gap has seen more prisons , nosey technocrats , surveillance and policing the same principle applies to work organisations just look at the figures in 1998 the average ftse ceo pay was 47 times greater than the average worker in 2013 the ratio was 174 1 in the us , ceos real pay increased by 937 between 1978 and 2014 workers only got 10 9 over the same period under these conditions , organisations tend to become increasingly punitive , even if such measures interfere with people doing their jobs effectively the third reason for all these managers is the huge importance placed today on metrics shareholders demand them senior bureaucrats swear by them whos pulling their weight and who isnt \? the only problem is that marginal product what you add to an organisations profit margin as an individual is notoriously difficult to measure productivity usually comes from a collective effort and how on earth do you quantify the more emotional and social dimension of many jobs today \? in the face of such uncertainty , employers either go over the top with every big data tool imaginable , such as amazon , or simply give up and resort to face to face supervision , like yahoo finally , research has discovered a sort of sociological law when it comes to hierarchies and bosses they can easily take on a life of their own and automatically proliferate companies end up needing more supervisors to check on the supervisors this is how organisations become inundated with administrators , and sooner or later all these managers need to justify their existence , normally by creating extra work somewhere else in the organisation emotional intelligence why managers should show a softer side read morethe problem is not really with managers per se theyre usually under the lash as much as anyone else its the steep and disempowering hierarchies that have mushroomed all over society in the last 15 years , especially in the employment sector that gap between a remote , technocratic elite at the top and everyone else has never seemed so vast this fosters distrust dissent and inevitably control advocates of the knowledge society once promised we could have our cake \( an extreme form of capitalism \) and eat it too \( personal freedom \) it turned out to be a ruse now workers have the worst of both worlds yes , theyre definitely on their own in terms of economic insecurity but theyre not left alone far from it is there a solution \?

for someone who made his career writing about and founding media organisations , rafat ali is surprisingly downbeat about what they can achieve if anything , the trump election has shown that we are ascribing too much value to what media can do , he says a week after donald trumps victory it has its role , it has to continue to do its role , its even more important today but the view that it will somehow change the world and change peoples minds , or give people the right path , its just too much to ask hes not alone in doubting the extent of the established medias influence following an election result which almost no outlet predicted and very few supported but in the post election autopsy , many commentators have said at least some of the blame should be laid at the door of facebook and its fake news filled filter bubbles ali shares their concerns , particularly about the parallel world where people have no connection to reality in which many millions of us citizens appear to live just the fact of what they believe about muslims , that hillary is doing this or obama is doing this its just crazy but he says many of the complaints from those working in tv or newspapers stem from an unrealistic belief in their own impact i think that while obviously this is a huge problem , we are trying to get out of media way more than its capable of giving , he says its not like if the majority of the media goes away , or a big proportion of the media goes away , that suddenly people are going to miss it ali has first hand experience of the impermanence of media from paidcontent his first company , which lasted not much more than a decade he launched the site in 2002 , taking what was then a relatively novel approach by applying lessons from one part of the media , such as the recording industry , to other areas such as newspapers , which were grappling with the disruptive powers of the internet it was acquired in 2008 by guardian media group for an undisclosed sum in the millions of pounds it was run as a standalone business and ali stayed until 2010 before leaving to travel the world for two years in early 2012 , gmg sold paidcontent to another digital media site , gigaom , which later that year shuttered the brand and itself closed in 2015 meanwhile , ali had returned from his trip with a plan to apply paidcontents connecting the dots approach to the world of travel and in the summer of 2012 he launched a business called skift with travel journalist jason clampet while most of those writing about the travel industry were focused on one sector such as airlines or hotels , ali based his plan on the realisation that travellers simply see an end to end process of getting around the world that seemed to leave a gap for a media organisation taking a more holistic approach while writing in a less stuffy , more accessible way than the established trade press in the early days , ali , who operated as skifts chief executive , planned to use the sites reporting as a foundation from which to sell data about travel , starting with the way it was marketed online however , things did not go to plan , and while trying to drum up investment in 2014 , he hit a brick wall i wasnt able to raise the round , he says it was the most humbling six months of my professional career we were three months away from running out of money we were 10 or 12 people at that point we had a famous as in famous in our company moment when we went to iceland for our first off site it was a very seminal moment for us as it was supposed to be a celebration of us closing the round ali and the team tried to work out how to continue growing without any outside investment the answer was to drop plans to sell data and focus on more established ways of making money in skifts case , research , events and \( native \) advertising two and a bit years later , ali says the business is now profitable , with double digit revenue growth heading for upwards of 10m a year within the next 18 months traffic is not huge , around 1 5 million visitors a month , but skifts priority is its list of email subscribers , which stands at more than 265 , 000 the company now employs close to 40 people , mostly at its new york headquarters , and is expanding into europe with hires such as a uk editor based in london though he chose to build his second company around travel , ali did not stop wading into arguments about the travails of established media companies , including the guardian he says most mainstream outlets are operating more like drive by media , where you hope and pray you show up in a feed , but he doesnt pretend to have all the answers i dont have a prescription for any of those people , he says its hard always , even in our business which is doing very well people say oh my god you guys are doing so well and i say yes , then i look back thinking holy shit , if they knew how hard it is to build a media company its always going to be hard and trumps victory is going to make things harder , not just for the media but also the travel industry , which ali says is facing a huge challenges from the insular ideologies that are taking over western politics i think trump has already said a lot of things that will enervate people coming to the us even if he does half the things he said it will have a bad effect on the travel industry his rhetoric stands directly opposite to what the promise of travel stands for the most progressive expression of human curiosity fringe is the new mainstream it is worrying for everyone , especially for europe which sits at the centre of immigration issues is there a link between digital filter bubbles and the new geographical isolationism taking hold of western politics \? ali says theres a direct line from how we have created a monoculture around ourselves , in many ways as a result of digital , that has led to the rise of neo isolationism and a virtual reality which manifests itself in believing in fake news the dispiriting picture ali paints is tempered by a belief in both the power of travel to increase understanding and the more outward looking and tolerant views of younger generations , even if they will take one or two decades to assert themselves the good news is that the world is travelling more , he says its not like saying after the first internet bubble burst , oh the internet is over it turns out that people continued to use the internet the number of people travelling from different parts of the world china , india , south east asia is going to continue to rise demography , which is changing in the us , is essentially the ultimate foil for any kind of isolationism same in uk , same in europe the young , much as us older people like to laugh at millennials , the reality is that they are a ton smarter than we were as kids so thats the hope and what else is there to hope for \? cvage 42education aligarh muslim university , india , computer engineering , graduated in

one day during his last year at primary school , jon adams drew a picture of a street in portsmouth , the city where he still lives the scene he drew had no people in it , but its representation of everything else suggested a talent beyond his years the headteacher happened to see the picture , and said he wanted to put it up in the schools entrance hall and that was an honour , adams says , particularly for someone who didnt think they were any good , because theyd been told they werent any good , every day adams was asked to write his name on the back , an instruction that threw up a choice he had difficulties with writing , and he knew his class teacher could be cruel if i asked for help , i knew what he would say oh , he cant even spell his own name , what rubbish is that \? so i did it myself the teacher called adams to the front of the class i went up , gave it to him , he held it up in front of the class , and then he tore it up he said , hes spelled his name wrong hell never be anything this happened 45 years ago in recent years , adams has been treated for post traumatic stress disorder , caused at least partly by that episode , and how long it lived on , not just in his memory , but in his understanding of the world and his place in it the story says a lot about the inhumanity that was once rife in the british education system but it also shines light on what its like spending a lot of your life being not just misunderstood , but routinely insulted someone telling you youre no good every day worms its way inside your head , adams says inside , you know youre all right , so theres this conflict going on since april 2013 , adams has known that he has asperger syndrome or , to put it another way , that he is autistic ten minutes online will tell you that adams condition comes down to a so called triad of impairments to do with social interaction , communication and imagination , or what some people call flexibility of thought although the fact that adams is a prolific artist suggests that , in his case , that last criterion might be misplaced since 2013 , many diagnoses of autism have also included a range of sensory issues , among them aversions to certain textures , sounds , smells and tastes , as well as a deep dislike of sudden noise in adams case , these seem to blur into a complex kind of synaesthesia he understands music as something he can touch , and experiences the colour yellow as a profoundly unpleasant taste , like mould adams sometimes talks about his condition in front of an audience , and there is one question that always comes up it goes my sons eight , he sits in his room all day , he does lego , he does complicated drawings , he wont talk to anyone else how do i make him socialise \? well , you dont hes made his world one day , hell show it to you dont let him grow up thinking that the way hes thinking and what hes doing are faulty jon adams was formally diagnosed at the age of 52 , at an nhs clinic run as an offshoot of cambridge universitys autism research centre , after he was referred there by his gp the initial spark had been a meeting with the centres founder and director , simon baron cohen \( the cousin , in case anyone was wondering , of sacha \) , who had spoken with adams at the cheltenham literature festival adams had begun to realise what sat under a lot of his experiences at the time , the biography that accompanied his work as an artist included the words probably autistic from may 2012 until june 2013 , he worked as the research centres artist in residence immediately afterwards , a specialist gave him his formal diagnosis , a process that involved an interview and something akin to a questionnaire i got the letter through , saying i scored 18 out of 18 autistic traits , and i had aspergers , adams says i meet baron cohen in a crowded starbucks near st pauls cathedral in london , where he wryly comments on the mixture of chatter , clattering cups and muzak for a lot of autistic people , this would probably be hell and casts his mind back over the 35 years he has been thinking about and researching autism he started working with six autistic children in a special unit in barnet , north london , in 1982 fifteen years later , he set up the cambridge research centre two years after that , in 1999 , he opened a clinic dedicated to diagnosing autistic adults my son received a diagnosis aged three he had fixations with particular music or places traits i recognise in myselfthere was a growing awareness that autism wasnt just about kids , he tells me i was receiving more and more emails saying , my sons an adult , but hes never fitted in might he have autism \? an adult couldnt go to a child and adolescent clinic , so where were they meant to go \? if they went to a learning disability clinic , and they had an iq above 70 , theyd be turned away so these people were like a lost generation that was a phrase i used a lot the national autistic society estimates that there are currently around 700 , 000 people living with autism in the uk more than one in every 100 of the population some of these people have learning disabilities some are what the medical vocabulary terms non verbal , or unable to speak others are so called high functioning , a sub group that includes those with asperger syndrome , the condition named after the austrian paediatrician who in the 1940s worked with a group of children he famously termed little professors asperger syndrome is distinguished by the fact that people who have it display no language delay as toddlers or small children \( asperger died in 1980 , long before the term asperger syndrome entered popular usage it has since been dropped from the relevant american diagnostic manual , but is still used in the uk \) it is among this latter group that you will find many of the 20 of autistic people currently thought to have been diagnosed as adults no national figures for adult autism diagnoses are available , but anecdotal evidence suggests numbers are rising baron cohen tells me that four years ago , 100 cases in cambridgeshire were referred to his clinic in the first four months of 2016 alone , it received 400 referrals most of the terms used to describe autism dont do justice to the nuanced , complicated traits bound up with it nonetheless , all its variants are covered by the catch all term autism spectrum disorder , or asd people who dispute that autism is any kind of disorder prefer the term autism spectrum condition the word spectrum was first used in this context by the pioneering british researcher lorna wing , who died in 2014 baron cohen explains what she meant at the time , i think , was a spectrum within those who come to clinical attention where its gone since is that this spectrum runs right through society , out into the general population my own interest in autism began when my son james received a diagnosis of asd at the age of three back then , some things seemed strange the social distance between him and his peers his fixations with particular music \( the clash , the beatles \) or places his pointed dislike of some foods or sounds \( i still curse whoever invented the public toilet hand dryer \) his amazing facility with technology now , these things are simply part of the fabric of our shared life i recognise echoes of myself in some of these traits \( the music , the technology \) , and of plenty of other people more than anything , his 10 years have brought me an ever growing understanding of the complexities of human psychology , both among those diagnosed as on the spectrum and so called neurotypical people unfortunately , the everyday world has yet to catch up only 16 of adults diagnosed with autism in the uk are in full time , paid employment in 2014 baron cohens team found that two thirds of the patients in their clinic had either felt suicidal or planned to kill themselves , and that a third had attempted to do so to my mind , this is nothing to do with autism or asperger syndrome , he says these are secondary mental health problems you came into the world with autism , and the way the world reacted , or didnt react , to you has led to a second problem , which is depression and thats preventable a week after talking to baron cohen , i take the train to the lancashire town of wigan , to meet 68 year old peter street , who got his autism diagnosis only 10 months ago he is an impish , funny presence , and says he loves conversation , perhaps a little too much i get this deep urge its a pain , almost , to talk to people when ive described it to the therapist , ive said im like a bucket of water and its full and then all of it comes out , and it empties facebook twitter pinterest peter street i get too much for people , and they get too much for me photograph rosie barnesafter 20 minutes , it becomes clear that street has the most astonishing life story of anyone i have ever interviewed his mother , he says , became pregnant with him when she was raped in his native bolton , the two of them were taken in by a man much older than her , who employed her as his housekeeper , and then married her and adopted street to give the arrangement a veneer of normality he grew up , he says , with no extended family and very few friends i get too much for people , and they get too much for me a lot of the time , i overpower people when i was a kid , when i made a friend , i would go and sit on their doorstep , waiting for them im a really early riser , and i cant cope with being late anywhere i used to go and sit on the doorstep , maybe six , seven in the morning and people obviously didnt like that his daily routine , he says , often revolved around an outside toilet , and his homes back wall , which he would use for solo games of football and marbles and that was wonderful , in some sense it wouldnt have been wonderful for some people , but it was for me he also made endless trips to the cinema , where he acquired a forensic knowledge of greek mythology he mentions steve reeves , the musclebound 1950s actor who played hercules i can take certain things in really odd things , sometimes , he says but i cant take in what most people take in every day at school , he found it almost impossible to tune in to the teachers they were shit with me , he says they knew how to abuse they were good at it they were bullies they used to stand me in the corner , in the wastebasket , and hit me over the head with the board rubber , to knock some sense into me ive always blamed my epilepsy on that he started having grand mal seizures when he was 15 it is now estimated that around a third of autistic people also experience epilepsy , though the relationship between the two is something that neuroscience has yet to fathom street left school unable to read or write he passed through a series of jobs a bakery , a butchers shop some of which came to an end because he found it difficult to process complex instructions , before settling into work as a gardener and gravedigger along the way , he married his wife , sandra , with whom he has three grownup children she doesnt like being with people , he says shes very quiet , very introverted in a way , shes a mirror in 1984 , after breaking his neck while trying to climb into a transit van that was pulling away , street began three years in recovery while he was in hospital , he met a fellow patient who was an english teacher , and started to work with him on his literacy then , through adult education , he discovered a talent for poetry while we talk , he hands me an anthology of his work , published in 2009 , that begins with a poem titled not being me , a perfect glimpse into the autistic experience of not fitting in in the late 1980s , street began to teach poetry in schools and day centres in the early 90s , he became a writer in residence at the bbc in manchester , which led to a series of assignments in 1993 , he went to croatia to write about the war that was then engulfing the balkans people with autism , its often said that they have no emotion or empathy , he says i have too much emotion , too much empathy it broke my heart three experiences preyed on him a meeting with an 18 year old abandoned in a refugee camp an occasion when he gave his water ration to an emaciated woman with a newborn child and the experience of eating a sumptuous meal in the town of lipik , with three or four kids at the window , looking in and i didnt have the balls to get up and go and give them my food by 2014 , his inability to put away these memories had become too much i went to a therapist and she said , i want you to go and see a friend of mine shes a specialist in diagnosing people with autism i thought , ill go along , as you do and she gave me these really strange games they were like a jigsaw puzzle four pieces white they were so simple , i thought i could do them and i couldnt he was handed five plastic figures and toys , and told to make a story with them and i couldnt do that , either i couldnt connect them together into one story she said i was highly intellectual , but on the autism spectrum his response was one of enormous relief i cried it was wonderful wonderful because all my life suddenly made sense and none of it the beatings , the abuse none of it was my fault apart from my family and sandra , id put it in the top five greatest things that have happened in my life absolutely , incredibly wonderful penny andrews got her diagnosis of asperger syndrome \( though she is perfectly comfortable with the term autistic \) when she was 30 back then , she was a regular user of livejournal , the social networking site that was a forerunner of myspace and facebook , and one of her online contacts had begun to write about the process of finding out he was autistic he wrote about it quite openly all the reasons hed gone for diagnosis , what the procedure was like , seeing half a dozen different psychiatrists before he found one who would refer him for diagnosis , she tells me and the more he wrote about it , the more i was like , oh , god , this is me andrews is now 35 she also has mild cerebral palsy , which manifests itself in spasms in her ankles , knees and wrists she is a para athlete whose specialism is the 100m , and has a punishing training schedule she wears a vintage bowie t shirt , has a wood cut picture of the yorkshire town of whitby tattooed on her right arm , and is a prolific and waspish presence on twitter andrews is currently awaiting a decision on the funding of her phd , which is focused on the relationships between academic libraries and data flows , digital labour , academic social networking services and governance in research support at secondary school , boys pretend to fancy you it kills you , because you take it seriouslypenny andrewsshe grew up in nidderdale in the yorkshire dales and now lives in leeds throughout her childhood , andrews says she had a deep sense of everything being wrong , somehow being clever and being a supposedly interesting person , but never able to maintain friendships and always , inexplicably , saying something wrong autism among women and girls is only starting to be properly understood the male to female ratio of autistic people currently stands at around 5 1 , although baron cohen says he and other autism specialists are currently in a transition period in their research the actual figure may eventually turn out to be very different theres a whole new topic researchers are latching on to , about camouflage whether females for whatever reason might be better at hiding their autism , he says , something that is borne out by andrews recollection of her time at school youre not supposed to get on with peoples parents better than them when you go round to their houses i didnt really want to play with people i just looked really aloof i read the diary of anne frank when i was six , and i talked about the holocaust but i would try to copy other people , how they talked and acted id watch tv programmes that other people watched so id have something to talk about neighbours and home and away she laughs i got a tamagotchi when everyone else got them , but i had no interest in it in the end , teenage etiquette and the nastiness that often comes with it proved too much girls are cruel they exclude each other , and pretend to be friends with each other , as a game and i get sarcasm , but i dont get insincerity and then , at secondary school , boys pretend to fancy you , because thats the most ludicrous idea they can think of it kills you because you take it seriously and they invite you to things , and then they dont show up , or theyre round the corner laughing all of that happened facebook twitter pinterest penny andrews i would try to copy other people , how they talked and acted photograph rosie barnesshe has been married to her husband , emil , for 11 years because he loves me the way i am , im completely myself with him how hard does she find it to read other peoples emotions \? it sort of depends if somebodys actually upset , i can probably feel it quicker than other people i can feel it too much but i cant usually tell if people are trying to get out of a conversation if people are trying to leave you have to tell me we need to stop i cant tell whether people like me or not , which is hard plenty of non autistic people have issues with that , i say , myself included but they seem at peace with it even with people ive known for a long time , i wont know whether they like me or not unless weve had an explicit conversation do you actually like me \? which turns people off when it comes to understanding autism , how much does she think the world still needs to change \? quite a lot because i think a lot of people still dont believe it , or think its a really mild thing well , it just makes it a bit harder for her to make friends , makes her a bit more anxious a lot of the time , its stressful painful when the sensory stuff is happening , its like youre being tasered andrews mentions people flicking their train tickets , or jangling their coins , or whistling its not just , thats annoying its , thats unbearable i have said , im really sorry , but can you stop doing that \? but people dont i have one last question self evidently , andrews is what some people call high functioning when she meets autistic people who are , say , non verbal , does she feel they are part of the same community \? yes and i think we have a duty , as people who can speak , to make sure that those people are looked after properly , and theyre not exploited , and they dont have inappropriate people speaking for them , or saying things like , hes got a mental age of three how would they know , if they cant communicate with them \? from what i can observe , they are experiencing the same thing as me when ive seen a non verbal person have a meltdown , it looks like my meltdowns , only more physical it looks she thinks for a minute it looks like an unrestrained version of how i sometimes feel in portsmouth , jon adams talks about what many autistic people call passing like andrews pretend interest in australian soaps and techno pets , its about managing to blend in , even if that means submerging whole chunks of your personality in adams case , passing took its toll and , in his late 30s , he hit an emotional wall not being true to yourself has an effect on you , he says id been married , and that had failed i had a girlfriend at the time , and that was failing i had a bit of a breakdown , and it took me a couple of years to get used to people he started out on a new path as an artist the work he does ranges across disciplines including sculpture and music , and regularly touches on his own story among his most affecting works is a piece called my school pen an old school fountain pen covered in spikes that perfectly evokes his struggles as a child you might have imperfections , but the basics of the way you view the world are right for youjon adamsin 2007 , he was working on a project with a group of teenagers for a charity called the foyer federation the woman in charge said , have you ever considered youre autistic \? he recalls i said , no , whats that \? she gave him a copy of mark haddons novel the curious incident of the dog in the night time , now almost a set text for people interested in the condition and i went away and i read one page and i cried he wells up now you might have faults and imperfections , but the basics of the way you view the world are right for you when everybody tells you , no , youre thinking wrong , you know youre not but if tells you that , you think youre faulty thats the root of the depression and the low self confidence so to read those things on a page was emotional it was i could see that someone understood and i thought , ok , maybe i am autistic it would be another six years before he was formally diagnosed for most adults who receive a diagnosis , the formal recognition might make belated sense of their lives , but it tends to make little difference to their daily existence according to the national autistic society , 70 of adults say they dont get the help they need people might just about recognise the conditions more extreme manifestations , but as penny andrews puts it , theyre probably not aware of the bulk of autistic adults people who are sitting there , coping with a lot of stuff , and the fact that theyre dealing with all this noise and stress and uncertainty that they shouldnt have to joblessness among autistic adults speaks for itself even such mundane things as the ubiquity of piped music , or inadequate signage in public spaces , attest to the same basic issue a society averting its eyes from things that blight hundreds of thousands of lives and might easily be improved we fetishise awareness of autism , but the point needs to be greater understanding and then practical action simon baron cohen cites one big frustration if autism comes down to an often profound difficulty navigating the world , only a tiny number of people currently receive the help they need to do that whether its about how to go shopping , or how to go for a job interview , or how to reply to your girlfriend to me , if we were a civilised society , wed be paying for mentors it doesnt seem unreasonable a government programme called access to work means that adams does get help from a support worker called donna , a calm and empathic woman who accompanies him to our interview donna is copied into all his emails , and in the course of adams work as an artist and a researcher into disability and creativity at portsmouth university , she regularly shadows him for a couple of hours a day among other things , her job is partly to assist him in the kind of reading between the lines that professional and social etiquette demands , but that a lot of autistic people find difficult very often , she explains , she is there to suggest that a particular request or instruction is put in a different way , or to remind people in authority that adams has his own ways of working you might have a three week time span to do a piece of work , adams explains , and if your line manager is checking you each day to find out your progress well , you might not do anything for two weeks you might be mulling it over in your head autism in the workplace an opportunity not a drawback read moreadams talks a lot about systemising , the quintessentially autistic way in which he divines patterns in the world , often immersing himself in them music is a good example he has an app called imini , which he uses to programme sequences of electronic notes into an on screen keyboard , which he can then use if a spurt of anxiety means he needs to readjust he plays me a bit , which i say reminds me of the kind of experimental music that came out of germany in the 1970s thats not a coincidence i got really into tangerine dream in about 1976 the repeating sequences were heaven for me , adams says he also likes the electronic pioneers kraftwerk , which rings loud bells my son is a kraftwerk obsessive , and regularly zeroes in on particular segments of their songs and plays them over and over does that sound familiar \? yes , adams says , and his mind goes back to 1978 i bought mr blue sky by elo there was a track on the other side , and it had a very strange beginning it was called fire on high , and id play it over and over and over again why \? it aligned me it made me feel that the world was right and everything was together it felt like it was part of me its like all the stars lining up he smiles things like that give me the feeling im meant to be here topicsautismhealthfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via

my boss is bullying me and undermining my confidence but what can i do about it \? my boss doesnt like me im not sure why and have given up trying to figure it out , but its making my working life miserable she undermines me in front of the rest of the team , interrupts with irrelevant asides when im trying to lead meetings , leaves me out of meetings i should be included in , and makes threats that i might lose my job or someone else more junior might lose theirs if i dont do some often irrelevant task i am desperate to leave but feel so undermined by her bullying , favouritism and passive aggressive behaviour that i feel worthless , useless and unemployable she likes to remind me that i am lucky to have a job i have worked here for 15 years but now feel trapped in a vicious circle what should i do \? jeremy saysyou dont know why your boss doesnt like you and id be fairly certain she doesnt either shes a bully , and bullies are irrational , unhappy creatures who derive strange pleasure from humiliating others , particularly in front of an audience some bullies achieve their ascendancy through force of personality your boss does it by abusing her seniority in saying this , im not asking you to understand her , let alone forgive her im saying something more important its the ultimate aim of bullies to intimidate their victims to such an extent that they begin to believe they somehow deserve to be bullied , that they are inferior , worthless beings and thats exactly whats happening to you you say you feel worthless , useless and unemployable , and yet you must know youre none of those things in the 15 years youve worked in this place presumably before the arrival of this monster you will have been a confident , competent , contented person that is , at heart , who you still are so you must fight very hard not to succumb if she senses you have , it will give her still further pleasure and shell even see it as in some way justifying her behaviour i would hope that those in authority will soon recognise the malign influence this person is having and will take steps to remove her but you cant wait for that you need to be deliberately , consciously defiant defy your boss by looking at yourself in the mirror and promising yourself that you wont let her win then with all the old confidence that you can muster , go out there and find yourself another job readers say keep a detailed log of all incidents , and keep all relevant documents , even post it notes my lawyer advised me this when i was in a similar situation it didnt stop me from having to leave , but i got a much better deal because i had proof of everything aranzazu the only solution is to get out sad and unfair , but sometimes life is like that but you can look for other jobs up hill and down dale with no time pressure as an aside , once you start looking you will probably find the stress flows away you will have control of the situation captaingrey i was in this situation with a boss who continually described me as difficult to like , a cold person , impossible to get along with , and i really sympathise in the end , feeling i was on the verge of a nervous breakdown , i simply quit i didnt have anything to go to but felt i had to for the sake of my health i had savings i could live on for six months \( with big lifestyle changes \) , a plan for low paid work if i couldnt find something else , and an alternative plan for retraining in the longer term the day i walked out was one of the happiest of my life the relief was incredible and i felt much better about myself almost immediately in the end i got a job within a month its only in hindsight that i recognise just what a bad mental state id got myself into , and i dread to think of the damage if i had stayed i know it is a risk , and for some is financially impossible , but if there is any way at all you can do it , then get out room32 join a union if you havent already , and wait until you are entitled to representation keep a log , including details of possible witnesses with the help of your union , submit a grievance detailing what you are complaining about and what you would like your employer to do about it intermax my secondment is failing as im being denied the it training i desperately needi have recently been promoted to team leader the second rung of the in house managerial ladder i had been working towards this for a year before i finally got my opportunity its on secondment for two months and will get made permanent if it goes well i explained in my interview that although i have a basic knowledge of the in house computer systems , i dont have the knowledge that the other team leader or the manager has since i have been promoted i have had to text or ring one of them each shift in order for help i explained that i wanted training and needed it to be able to do my job , but have been told its going to be difficult to find the time now things are going wrong and i am unable to fix them there have been occasions where they havent answered the phone and ive been completely stuck , and been reprimanded for it on the next shift if this continues i cant see the secondment being made permanent , from either side , as i dont want to take the job permanently if this is what is to come jeremy saysi suspect youre being just a little too polite and hesitant because you dont want to make a fuss or seem to be looking for excuses when things go wrong , you havent been nearly firm enough in your request for training this could lead to exactly the outcome you fear , with your secondment failing to be made permanent and you , rather than your workplace , being held responsible you might , as you suggest , be relieved but that would be unfair and unnecessary you need to write a cool , considered note to your manager , copied to hr \( if you have such a department \) avoid sounding either plaintive or apologetic stick strictly to the facts say that you are grateful to both your manager and the other team leader for the time they spend helping you deal with in house system issues now that youve been doing the job for some time its become even more apparent that you shouldnt have to rely on such ad hoc help but need formal computer system training can they please arrange a programme for you as soon as possible , because only then will you feel able to fulfil the role with which youve been entrusted this will hopefully prompt the training you need at worst , being on the record when your performance is eventually evaluated , it should ensure youre not unfairly penalised readers say cover your back write a report to your manager requesting a specialised minion on short contract , adding that training would be cheaper and bite the bullet

lawsuit over the now defunct trump university for 25 million , according to new york attorney general eric schneiderman in 2013 , my office sued donald trump for swindling thousands of innocent americans out of millions of dollars through a scheme known at trump university donald trump fought us every step of the way , filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university today , that all changes todays 25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by donald trump and a major victory for the over 6 , 000 victims of his fraudulent university i am pleased that under the terms of this settlement , every victim will receive restitution and that donald trump will pay up to 1 million in penalties to the state of new york for violating state education laws the victims of trump university have waited years for todays result and i am pleased that their patience and persistence will be rewarded by this 25 million settlement donald trump announced the nomination of alabama senator jeff sessions as attorney general and kansas congressman mike pompeo as director of the central

his crotch to get his attention then discuss science with him november 18 , 2016 long before michael flynn led a chant demanding the imprisonment of hillary clinton , and before he came to view an entire religion as responsible for terrorism , he issued a public plea for nuance in intelligence ret lt gen mike flynn photograph alex wong getty imagesin 2009 , flynn followed his longtime friend from the elite joint special operations command \( jsoc \) , stanley mcchrystal , to afghanistan their partnership had transformed jsoc into an apparatus that collected and disseminated intelligence as rapidly as it killed people , and then fed that intelligence back into its internal systems to accelerate the lethal process as with jsoc , mcchrystal would command the war and flynn would run its intelligence shop but flynn soon considered the entire us intelligence apparatus in afghanistan to be focusing on the wrong targets the trouble , in flynns estimation , was that us intelligence focused too much on the taliban insurgency it gave comparatively little emphasis on granular data about trends among afghans themselves , which at the time the coterie of counterinsurgents around mcchrystal considered decisive win the people , the thinking went , and the insurgency would lose the base of support necessary to survive in a rare move for a serving intelligence officer , flynn took his critique public the most salient problems in afghanistan are attitudinal , cultural and human , he wrote in a january 2010 paper for the center for a new american security , at that point the ascendant defense thinktank and a job pipeline into the obama pentagon m erely killing insurgents usually serves to multiply enemies rather than subtract them commanders , flynn and his co authors wrote , needed information including census data and patrol debriefs minutes from shuras with local farmers and tribal leaders polling data and atmospherics reports from psychological operations and female engagement teams refocusing on population centric information , the authors wrote , was crucial to victory it would admittedly offer few clues about where to find insurgents , but it would provide elements of even greater strategic importance a map for leveraging popular support and marginalizing the insurgency itself the 2010 paper , which took many in intelligence circles by surprise

from passing traffic i would like to express my gratitude to jared kushner for reviving interest in my 2006 book , the price of admission i have never met or spoken with him , and its rare in this life to find such a selfless benefactor of course , i doubt he became donald trumps son in law and consigliere merely to boost my lagging sales , but still , im thankful jared kushner photograph carolyn kaster apmy book exposed a grubby secret of american higher education that the rich buy their underachieving childrens way into elite universities with massive , tax deductible donations it reported that new jersey real estate developer charles kushner had pledged 2 5m to harvard university not long before his son jared was admitted to the prestigious ivy league school , which at the time accepted about one of every nine applicants \( nowadays , it only takes one out of 20 \) i also quoted administrators at jareds high school , who described him as a less than stellar student and expressed dismay at harvards decision there was no way anybody in the administrative office of the school thought he would on the merits get into harvard , a former official at the frisch school in paramus , new jersey , told me his gpa grade point average did not warrant it , his sat scores did not warrant it we thought , for sure , there was no way this was going to happen then , lo and behold , jared was accepted it was a little bit disappointing because there were at the time other kids we thought should really get in on the merits , and they did not risa heller , a spokeswoman for kushner companies , said in an email on thursday that the allegation that charles kushners gift to harvard was related to jareds admission is and always has been false his parents , charles and seryl kushner , are enormously generous and have donated over 100m to universities , hospitals and other charitable causes jared kushner was an excellent student in high school and graduated from harvard with honours \( about 90 of jareds 2003 class at harvard also graduated with honours \) my kushner discoveries were an offshoot of my research for a chapter on harvard donors somebody had slipped me a document i had long coveted the membership list of harvards committee on university resources the university wooed more than 400 of its biggest givers and most promising prospects by putting them on this committee and inviting them to campus periodically to be wined , dined and subjected to lectures by eminent professors my idea was to figure out how many children of these corporate titans , oil barons , money managers , lawyers , high tech consultants and old money heirs had gone to harvard a disproportionate tally might suggest that the university eased its standards for the offspring of wealthy backers i began working through the list , poring over whos who in america and harvard class reunion reports for family information charles and seryl kushner were both on the committee i had never heard of them , but their joint presence struck me as a sign that harvards fundraising machine held the couple in especially fond regard the clips showed that charles kushners empire encompassed 25 , 000 new jersey apartments , along with extensive office , industrial and retail space and undeveloped land unlike most of his fellow committee members , though , kushner was not a harvard man he had graduated from new york university this eliminated the sentimental tug of the alma mater as a reason for him to give to harvard , leaving another likely explanation his children sure enough , his sons jared and joshua had both enrolled there how did less than stellar high school student jared kushner get into harvard \? daniel golden read more just going to leave this here on news that

abortions at the state level but experts saying dismantling the precedent would be much more difficult than trump seems to think it will be roe has withstood the test of time , over 40 years , said kelly baden , interim senior director of us policy and advocacy at the center for reproductive rights , noting that us supreme court justices take precedents seriously even when they disagree with them it has survived anti choice administrations , including ones that have pushed to appoint anti choice justices to the supreme court in the interview , trump said that if roe v wade is overturned ,

unduly harsh with the secretary mr sessions admonished me to be careful what you say to white folks had mr sessions merely urged me to be careful about what i said to folks , that admonition would have been quite reasonable but that was not the language that he used there was a period in our own lifetimes when blacks were regularly admonished to be particularly polite or deferential , and a

will implement the agenda that won him the presidency some of trumps defenders , like tech investor peter thiel , contend that trump should not be taken literally but the democratic senator from oregon shows no signs of interest in that discussion as perhaps the democratic partys premier civil libertarian on capitol hill , his anticipation of the trump administration starts from the perspective that the president elect will govern as he campaigned against muslims , against immigrants , for torture , for surveillance wyden , from his perch on the intelligence committee , is preparing for a four year battle were going to have to make sure now that a political agenda doesnt replace a set of constitutional priorities thats the heart of it , wyden said in an interview with the guardian this week wyden is one of the few national politicians who can plausibly claim to have fought national security abuses and championed civil liberties with equal vigor in the george w bush and barack obama administrations he is far more comfortable discussing policies or proposals than he is discussing personalities , opting to refer to trump simply as the president elect you look at some of what the president elect has to say and it certainly ought to be a wake up call from the standpoint of potential abuse of power , wyden said a quote sticking in wydens mind these days is one trump issued in july after the democratic national committee hack , which us intelligence has blamed on russia trump , discussing his political opponents , mused honestly , i wish i had that power id

whether flynn had accepted the role or not retired u s army lieutenant general michael flynn arrives to meet with u s president elect donald trump at trump tower in new york city photograph mike segar reutersflynn , 57 , was the only national security figure of his rank to publicly align himself with trump and remained loyal to the businessman throughout his campaign while other national security experts criticised and denounced the gop nominee , flynn took part in campaign rallies where he led chants against hillary clinton , including those that called for her to be locked up the enemy camp in this case is hillary rodham clinton , flynn said in florida during the summer the three star general also delivered what was reported to be a fiery speech at the republican national convention , where he lambasted barack obamas empty speeches and his misguided rhetoric , which he said had caused the world to have no respect for americas word , or might flynn , who in 2015 declared himself a registered democrat , held senior positions in the 18th airborne corps , at the joint chiefs of staff at the pentagon and at us central command , which runs us military operations in the middle east

its allies , co authored with the historian and former reagan administration official michael ledeen , he wrote that he is not a devotee of so called political correctness he has come under fire for regularly appearing on russian state owned television station rt , and once attended a gala hosted by the channel , sitting two places away from the russian president , vladimir putin he later said his speakers bureau had arranged his trip to russia and that he saw no distinction between rt and other news outlets such as cnn and msnbc flynn was once opposed to waterboarding and other banned extreme interrogation techniques , but , according to the washington post , in reference to trumps previously stated openness to reinstating such techniques , he said he would be reluctant to take options off the table asked by al jazeera if he would support trumps threat to kill the families of suspected terrorists , he said i would have to see the circumstances of that situation in july , flynn retweeted an antisemitic post by a trump supporter who mocked the clinton campaigns blaming of russian hackers for leaked emails the tweet , by a pseudonymous user , read cnn implicated the ussr is to blame ! not anymore , jews not anymore flynn later deleted his retweet and apologised , saying it was a mistake and that he had meant to link to an article on clinton and the dnc emails flynn also tweeted in february that fear of muslims is rational , a tweet which was never deleted general flynn \( genflynn \) fear of muslims is rational please forward this to others the truth fears no

donald trump was raised eeman abbasi speaks during a protest on the university of connecticut campus against the election of donald trump photograph pat eaton robb apas a muslim , she was concerned about the newly minted president elect and his campaign promises that targeted muslims , immigrants and women but it wasnt until an older white couple began yelling at her , 10 minutes into her weekly commute to her internship , that the reality of trumps america set in most of what they were saying was telling me i cant wear it the hijab anymore and telling me to take it off , nizam , a bengali american , said the 19 year old student had heard some islamophobic comments before , but hadnt experienced such aggressive harassment in new york city , where she , like trump , was born and raised but the stream of verbal abuse forced her to confront a reality she had been trying to avoid that trump had actually won i didnt believe it until the moment this incident occurred , she said of trumps victory i dont think i absorbed it and felt the reality of it , i didnt i kept myself distracted all of wednesday and then thursday happened and then it hits me , this is actually whats going on and it was not ok nizam is one of several muslims around the country who have spoken to the guardian about life since trumps victory trump won the keys to the white house following an incendiary campaign where he proposed a ban on muslims , said muslims hate americans and promised a muslim registry kansas secretary of state kris kobach , reportedly a key member of trumps transition team , said on tuesday that the president elects advisers are already considering the muslim registry according to the southern poverty law center \( splc \) , the amount of hate crimes reported since election night has been unusually high as of tuesday , the civil rights organization had tallied 437 incidents nationwide this is the case even in seemingly muslim friendly places like new york city , and in michigan , which has one of the largest concentrations of muslims in the us civil rights groups there have reported an uptick in harassment with one calling for a hate crime investigation after a muslim woman in ann arbor was allegedly forced to remove her hijab by an unknown white man who , according to police , threatened to set her on fire with a lighter in another reported incident , two men shoved an 18 year old woman wearing a hooded sweatshirt , commented on religion and asked her do you know youre in america \? in the traditionally liberal city of ann arbor , two alleged incidents of ethnic intimidation and religious bias in a week is unusual , said detective lt matthew lige of the ann arbor police department certainly ann arbor , as a community that prides itself on its diversity , in race , religion , national origin , ethnicity , all those type of things , he said so , for us to have two incidents that fit in this category is unusual and certainly with the political climate that were in right now , its concerning michigan and new york are home to some of the largest concentrations of muslims in the us but it is impossible to say with certainty how many muslims there are in the country as the census bureau does not ask questions about faith estimates vary from as few as 3 million to as many as 8 million within that overall demographic , there is huge diversity in terms of geography , religious identity and race cum ethnicity , which renders any generalizations about the muslim community in america perilous muslims in trump 's america realities of islamophobic presidency begin to sink in read more is it correct that donald trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion \? heres what he told nbc news in november last year donald trump would certainly implement a database system tracking muslims in the united states , the republican front runner told nbc news on thursday night i would certainly implement that absolutely , trump said in newton , iowa , in between campaign town halls there should be a lot of systems , beyond databases , he added we should have a lot of systems when asked whether muslims would be legally obligated to sign into the database , trump responded , they have to be they have to be later , trump was repeatedly asked to explain the difference between requiring muslims to enter their information into a database and making jewish people register in nazi germany he responded four times by saying you tell me jason miller , communications director for the trump transition team , has released this statement in response to reports that the incoming administration has been considering a register for muslims arriving in the us president elect trump has never advocated for any registry or system that tracks individuals based on their religion , and to imply otherwise is completely false the national registry of foreign visitors from countries with high terrorism activity that was in place during the bush and obama administrations gave intelligence and law enforcement communities additional tools to keep our country safe , but the president elect plans on releasing his own vetting policies after he is sworn in barack obama is the latest figure to speak out about fake news on facebook and other media platforms , suggesting that it helped undermine the us political process , olivia solon reports if we are not serious about facts and whats true and whats not , if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda , then we have problems , he said during a press conference in germany since the surprise election of donald trump as president elect , facebook has battled accusations that it has failed to stem the flow of misinformation on its network and that its business model leads to users becoming divided into polarized political echo chambers obama said that we live in an age with so much active misinformation that is packaged very well and looks the same whether its on facebook or on tv if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made , then we wont know what to protect we wont know what to fight for and we can lose so much of what weve gained in terms of the kind of democratic freedoms and market based economies and prosperity that weve come to take for granted , he said barack obama on fake news 'we have problems' if we ca n't tell the difference read more

in the community where you are presently living , she says once youve established connections , it is likely you will bump into them again and again the community to me feels a bit like a global

transatlantic cruise for digital nomads eight things to do before living and working abroad read moredo your research bone up on tax and visa requirements before you move somewhere new , as the laws vary from country to country if you are only a tourist , there shouldnt be much of an issue but if you are away from the uk for more than three years you will no longer be treated as a uk resident and different obligations will apply , says marshall visa hopping can be costly and exhausting , warns andrews most people fizzle out after a handful of years of living visa to visa a lot of it depends on your level of wealth having an established home base and travelling every month or two for extended periods of time is refreshing , but expensive remember that it is not for everyone while the idea of being able to work on a beach at sunset , or in the middle of a buzzing city , might seem dreamy , the lifestyle of the digital nomad does not suit everyone while it can bring great freedom and flexibility , it can also be insecure , especially if you worry when the next paycheque is coming in it can be hard work , theres a lot of change and life is unpredictable , says bard ive seen many people burn out and go back to the nine to five world , and others take to it like ducks to water successful digital nomads need to be independent , self motivated and productive as well as being able to live with the unfamiliar and deal with ambiguity for andrews , the digital nomad lifestyle feels safer ive been close to many people whose careers have been taken from them from no real fault of

forty seven thousand hours thats how much time you could potentially waste on email over the course of your working life , according to a recent washington post article to put that number in perspective , its roughly equivalent to spending five years on email as the writer annie dillard said how we spend our days is , of course , how we spend our lives and increasingly , we are spending our days largely on email the average office worker dips into their inbox about 11 times an hour , receives about 147 messages a day , and spends nearly 30 of their total working week in their inbox the way to a better work life balance \? unions , not self help read morebut just because were spending all this time on email doesnt mean were enjoying it when i talk to people about their email habits , the most common feelings they mention are guilt , anxiety , and overwhelm certainly not enthusiasm whats more , research shows that the more frequently we check our email , the more stressed out we feel so why do we spend so much time doing something that we dont particularly enjoy \? the fact is that even though we might not care for the content of every email we receive , many of us are addicted to the act of checking email it activates a primal impulse in our brains to seek out rewards and in this regard were not very different from rats back in the 1930s , the psychologist bf skinner invented a device called the operant conditioning chamber , now known as the skinner box , which he used to test behavioural theories on rats skinner wanted to see what effect different kinds of positive reinforcements , such as food pellets , and negative reinforcements , such as electric shocks , would have on the animals first , he experimented with putting the rats on a fixed schedule of behaviour reinforcement for instance , if the rat pressed the lever inside the box , it would receive a food pellet if it continued pressing the lever , every hundredth time the rat would receive another pellet skinner also experimented with a variable schedule in this scenario the rat didnt know when the reward was coming it might have to press the lever 20 times to get a pellet , or it might have to press the lever 186 times to get a pellet the system was random , and the rat could never know exactly when the reward was coming surprisingly , the rats were significantly more motivated when they were on the variable schedule skinner found that even if he took away the rewards for the rats on the variable schedule , they would keep working , furiously pressing the lever for a very long time before giving up much longer , in fact , than the rats on the fixed schedule would is this starting to sound familiar yet \? for better or worse , humans respond to positive rewards very similarly to rats and as dan ariely , a behavioural economist who studies the irrational actions of humans , explained to me email is a near perfect random rewards system the fetishisation of work is making us miserable lets learn to live again anna coote read moremost of the time when you press the lever to check your email messages , you get something disappointing or bothersome a communication from a frustrated client or a boss with an urgent request but every once in a while you press the lever and you get something exciting an email from a long lost friend or , if youre really lucky , a cat video and its those random rewards that we find so addictive they make us want to push the lever again and again and again , even when we have better things to do but it cuts both ways while you might get something good , you also might get something upsetting or anxiety inducing and that feeling of queasy uncertainty is another aspect of emails strange allure how many times have you confidently sent off a message only to find yourself stewing , just minutes later , over why you have not yet received a response \? wondering if your request or your phrasing had been received as it was intended \? worried that you yourself should have written back sooner , said something differently , asked for less , or asked for more \? this problem springs from a lack of social feedback normally when we communicate with someone in person , or even on the phone , we are reading a thousand little social cues as we talk and deciding what to do next based on those cues it often happens that we will start to say something but then , based on non verbal feedback we get from the other person , think better of it and take another tack when we communicate through email , however , that social feedback loop is absent emails lack the facial expressions , physical gestures , and vocal tone that typically shape our interpretation of what someone is saying and allow us to adjust our delivery in order to get our true meaning across this results in what the psychologist daniel goleman calls a natural negativity bias towards email goleman argues that if the sender feels positive about an email , then the receiver usually feels neutral and if the sender feels neutral about the message , then the receiver typically feels negative about it in other words , its as if every message you send gets automatically downgraded a few positivity notches by the time someone else receives it well thats all well and good , you might be thinking , but what am i supposed to do about it \? the solution to our email problem lies with getting more in touch with what makes us uniquely human overcoming the negativity bias , and allaying some of its attendant anxiety , requires us to upgrade our empathy and enthusiasm when it comes to digital communication to communicate more like living , breathing , feeling humans than impersonal robots exchanging information a recent study done by the people behind the boomerang email app crunched the data from millions of email exchanges and found that messages that expressed emotion were most likely to get a response and among those , emails using positive words and subjective language earned the most replies in other words , messages that encouraged people and expressed a point of view were the most effective we dont want neutral , anodyne , just the facts maam messages , we want to communicate with people who are interesting and interested another quality that separates us from animals and robots alike is the ability to set goals and pursue them with single minded focus as humans , we are uniquely equipped to train our attention on a given task and keep it there to not be distracted by random rewards or false urgency or fomo \( fear of missing out \) to focus instead on long term goals and meaningful rewards but right now we are choosing to succumb to emails addictive allure and to let it dictate our mood , our focus , and our to do lists at work rather than marshalling up the willpower that we know is necessary to turn our attention away from our inboxes the data is clear about the drawbacks of living in email those who process their messages reactively , nibbling on notifications and multitasking throughout the day , are significantly less productive and less happy than those who process their email in batches , choosing two or three discrete time blocks per day to focus 100 on their email so that they can ignore it the rest of the time when it comes to email , exercising just a little self control goes a long way can you go an hour without peeking into your inbox \? can you distinguish between whats truly urgent and whats not \? can you say no to some opportunities so that you can say yes to your priorities \? the bottom line is if we want to get out of the productivity rat race , we have to stop acting like rats a masterclass in productivity how to kill email overload and get real work done , takes place at the guardian offices in london on wednesday 16 november spaces are filling quickly so book your place now , or explore the full range of masterclasses on our calendartopicsemailopinioncomputingwork careersinternetcommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
in a day where the visitors went the better part of the first session without losing a wicket , that wasnt a bad fightback from the australians as the afternoon wore on during the final session in particular all batsmen were put under enormous pressure by quicks rabada and abbott through a marathon stint between the two , but only one wicket fell , that of warner \( 45 \) and even that came in bizarre circumstances , abbotts delivery ricocheting off his thigh and arm before landing on the stumps khawajas half century came from 91 balls he was routinely beaten outside the off stump as too were warner and then smith but held his nerve before capitalising on some loose deliveries towards the end of play that end came prematurely on the basis of bad light , seven overs lost so well be back again at 10am for another long day at hobart tomorrow a long day where australia will have plenty of work still yet to do knocking off the 120 runs of deficit that still remain , in an innings where adam voges may well be batting for his career in short be sure to tune in , and follow every over with us here at the guardian thanks for your company have a good night thats it stumps the umpires have called it off ill gather my thoughts for a final wrap in just a jiffy i wish i could make a mount wellington reference but truth told , i cant see it through the clouds there are patches of blue sky either side of bellerive , but to get back on now is a tough ask would require a lot of wind in a hurry three of the four umpires gathered in the middle having a chat , so either way well know pretty soon ric finlay \( ricfinlay \) aus have knocked off half the deficit , with the loss of only two wickets two days to go game not over yet november 14 , 2016 36th over australia 121 2 \( khawaja 56 , smith 18 \) ooooh yeah , khawaja cover driving on the up and doing it with style you get four runs when doing that granted , it came the ball after he was beaten outside the off stump oh and now theyre off for bad light let me go outside for a tic and see if i can make a prediction about the likelihood of them returning for what little that is worth stand by 35th over australia 116 2 \( khawaja 51 , smith 18 \) just a single from khawaja in response to a relatively quiet maharaj over just doing a job to give the quicks a rest here , the spinner fourth ump mick martel is out there to take a light reading the australians would relish the chance to get out of there and into the showers a fraction earlier than scheduled 34th over australia 115 2 \( khawaja 50 , smith 18 \) vernon philander is angry okay \? got it \? understand \? okay he demonstrates this with some more annoyed stares after khawaja dispatches a long hop through cover point to begin the over later in the set he took a second , this time behind point it was full and swinging , but he did enough then a single to mid on to end the over brought khawajas half century ! nicely played in rugged circumstances 91 balls to get there good going from the australian number three has to get to stumps though 33rd over australia 106 2 \( khawaja 41 , smith 18 \) chris rogers makes a fair point about the importance of the current two sticking it out if i was adam voges id be praying they get through four more overs so he has the benefit of a nightwatchman ahead of him , with his career pretty much on the line they get through maharajs first over after drinks easily enough , smith pumping him over midwicket when dropping short remember it was smith who in perth exposed voges by getting out when set late in the day will he look after him today \? as they take a drink , lets whip through some comments chris drew asks if kettleborough is the best umpire in the world \? theres certainly a consensus forming around that given his freakishly good record in the heavily scrutinised drs era doesnt hurt that hes opposite umpire dar this week , who is having a shocker of late ian forth emails in with an oled tv gag and warner being able to watch it tonight without needing to worry about batting tomorrow gee weve got some milage out of the warner tv advert , havent we \?

well find out in a tic 29th over australia 91 2 \( khawaja 34 , smith 11 \) abbott into the ninth over of his own spell , and has dropped off just a tad reckon that might be his last one , confirmed in all likelihood by a stray delivery onto smiths pads to end the over the home captain makes no mistake in putting it away 28th over australia 86 2 \( khawaja 33 , smith 7 \) rabada will bowl far lesser spells and take many wickets , is abc caller gerard whateleys assessment of the nine over stint that has probably just concluded if body language is anything to do by without a wicket sure enough , his final set is just as magnificent as the eight that came before it , concluding with yet another legcutter that beats the australian captain by a significant margin smith did strike a boundary through point earlier in the over , however , meaning that australia have passed their first innings total ! you little beauty ! beneath the southern cross i stand ! anthony bieniak \( bienie \) game situation aside , this is test cricket at its best contest between bat and ball , tension on every over november 14 , 2016 27th over australia 82 2 \( khawaja 33 , smith 3 \) this pair benefitted from a brief rain delay , but they are the only two who have been used since the final session commenced 65 minutes ago and why would you change them \? abbott starts his set with a delivery that goes underground didnt see that coming a couple of hours ago he then successfully beats khawaja twice in a row thats six play misses in three overs if i recall correctly and i usually do youll rarely see better fast bowling anywhere than these two at the moment they deserve better admirable from khawaja to not lose his nerve in response 26th over australia 82 2 \( khawaja 33 , smith 3 \) rabada is just superb , beating smith with a ball moving away from him off the seam yet another unplayable australia were stiff on saturday , but theyre experiencing some luck today oh , and he does it again later in the over ! the old fashioned carbon copy hard to criticise the australian captain there is rabada the best quick in the world \?

around the wicket the right armer is tailing away from a left hand bat utter class reminiscent of flintoff v gilchrist in the 2005 ashes come to think of it stumps are back in yet the fourth ump still has his umbrella out give it a spell , mate hes literally the only human in this cricket ground with a brolly out anyway , the players are on good news the tv commentary use the rain break to run through their classic catches cue a camera looking at mark waugh , with his 1999 gem at hobart , turning that pulsating test match , included in the selection what times to be a 15 year old and bill lawrys call as well phwoooooar what a catch ! clean as a whistle ! so light that the south africans are walking from the field rather than the jog you normally expect when people dont want to get wet just the hessian cover down at this stage dont expect well be off for long 21st over australia 76 1 \( warner 43 , khawaja 32 \) after being made to look a bit daft by abbotts supreme spell here in his previous over , warner gets back on top with a push through cover to begin the over and after a couple of good leaves , turns him into the onside for a single much better over warner persevere then prosper reluctant to say this , but looking pretty dark out here rain coming \?

i have spent 42 years pushing against apatriarchy that tries to tell me what to look like , what to feel , who to demur to , and that there are many things that icant do because im female the weaker sex \? i gave birth i wouldnt be balled up on the ground if kicked in the groin its tiring and it takes a toll and ill keep pushing in my own steady way for thomas frank \( trump has taken the white house and he has the liberals to thank , 10 november \) to leave sexism out of his response piece wholesale \( not one mention \) and to choose to use the word shrill toward the end of his article , a word which conjures up images of women \( when has a man been called shrill \? \) , leaves me frustrated and tired frank , whom im sure is a wonderful person in many respects , is as sexist as the next and hasnt faced his own inner demons whether or not you think hillary clinton had the best interest of the lower class and working middle class in mind , for frank to say that she isnt really competent , that her email server was a real issue and that biden would have been a better choice is just a cloak for his inability to face himself in the mirror to his credit , or to the detriment of at least of half of us , frank is not alone in his unacknowledged sexism even when we pit a woman against the least competent candidate we could imagine , for arguably the most important job there is , our society as a whole cant stomach voting for her voters literally stayed home from the polls rather than elect a woman lets throw this frank article in the virtual trash where it belongs , and instead read response articles penned by feminists \( of all genders \) we have work to do india viola amid the negativity and strong words about the result of the presidential election , it is important that we stay positive and true to our morals and standards , unlike donald trump as ayoung woman , feminist and member of the younger generation , i can certainly say that i will not tolerate trumps revolting words against women and those who dont fit his mould of a perfect citizen from this , i am reminded of the standards of how men should behave towards women with respect and compassion the doom and gloom events of this year have taught and emphasised to me the importance of staying positive and not letting morals and standards slip because of the behaviour of a leader such as trump furthermore , hillary clinton has shown , particularly to women and girls , that anything is possible if you truly believe , and that women can be and are champions for this as she said in her speech , there is still much work to be done and the only way we will aid the work ahead is if we stand together with positive energy and hope against people like trumps fear and discrimination eleanor sutcliffe in an otherwise searching article \( report , 12 november \) sarah churchwell falls prey to the same negativism in attitudes toward women politicians that shes writing about while it is true that a staggering 53 of white women voted against clinton , it is not true that once again , a female candidate did not carry even the female vote some 54 of women voted for clinton not all white , but all women marcia saunders is it possible that we \( who are appalled by his election \) have underestimated donald trump \?

its virtually a year to the day since david cameron declared that access to the internet shouldnt be a luxury it should be a right were going to bring fast broadband to every home and business that wants it but for many trying to work in broadband not spots , such pledges are increasingly hollow now , many communities are taking matters into their own hands , and some are hopeful they might be able to secure a solution that would mean they are no longer stuck in the digital dark ages the government has previously claimed that 95 of the country should have access to superfast broadband by the end of 2017 , but last month camerons successor theresa may highlighted the scale of the challenge when she complained that half of people living in rural areas , and so many small businesses , cant get a decent connection however , its not just in remote locations take damian belson , for example he is a web developer who is forced to go to cafes and the library to upload his work because his broadband speed is so snail like he lives in rotherhithe in south east london , just a few hundred metres from the towers of canary wharf as he says , its almost central london , yet thousands of rotherhithe residents are only getting around two megabits per second the average uk broadband speed , according to ofcom , is 28 9mbps \( this is due to be updated in the coming weeks \) , and superfast broadband is defined as 24mbps or more in urban areas , it is often blocks of flats that are particulalry afflictedthere are many other digital black holes around the country earlier this year website cable co uk named the places with the slowest average speeds , with the list topped by the gloucestershire village of miserden , where the typical figure was just 1 3mbps , and the lowest speed measured was just 0 12mbps i live in ceredigion in west wales , which , according to the news and information site thinkbroadband , lies seventh from the bottom out of 650 uk constituencies for connectivity as is the case with many places dealing with the everyday challenges of trying to work within an area with internet speeds supposedly often lower than those at mount everest base camp , frustrations run deep in urban areas , it is often blocks of flats that are particularly afflicted because many of these buildings have a dedicated line from the ground floor to the nearest telephone exchange they are made of copper , and can run long distances , slowing the speed at which information travels in some cases , communities fed up with waiting for bt to get to them are turning to the growing numbers of smaller companies and local ventures that offer potential solutions for those in supposedly hard to reach areas these include wispire , a local service provider based in norfolk that is owned by the diocese of norwich and publishing company archant , and uses parish church spires to deliver broadband to remote areas steve maine , who was its chief executive until the beginning of this month , says in reality , fibre cable is a good technology for high transition speeds in urban areas , but much more expensive per person in less populated regions you need to use other solutions he adds good , reliable broadband is more important than superfast for the majority of people for those getting by on under 2mbps , 10mbps would be nirvana so how are some of these people faring \? damian belson about 2mbpswe live opposite canary wharf , which is almost central london , yet the area has one of the largest number of exchange only lines this means there are very few cabinets and so its more expensive for bt to upgrade if youre lucky enough to live near the exchange you can get 8mbps or 9mbps , but for thousands of us its nearer 2mbps weve got a pressure group and have been fighting for a better internet connection for four or five yearswhen i became self employed about five years ago i knew it would be an issue , but i didnt realise how much i can work from home when im emailing or coding offline , but i cant upload anything luckily , there are some nice cafes and a good library in the area it doesnt feel like an inconvenience so much until you realise how much time youre wasting it doesnt affect the quality of my work , but i definitely have to put in longer hours to make up the time weve got a pressure group , broadbandse16 , and weve been fighting for a better internet connection for four or five years and tried everything based on thinkbroadband estimates , around 7 , 400 homes in the area cant get broadband faster than 10mbps , and 4 , 000 hover around 2mbps the local council made an election promise a few years ago to solve the problems , and last summer the managing director of bt london outlined what he was going to do to improve it in rotherhithe by march 2017 im afraid i just dont believe what theyre saying anyway , none of bts published plans addresses the issues of those most affected , so the 4 , 000 figure wont change much in the foreseeable future belson , 47 , says a company called hyperoptic which specialises in bringing full fibre optic broadband direct to multi dwelling buildings is being very proactive , but currently doesnt have plans to connect single houses , which rotherhithe has a lot of , so this will only be part of the solution he adds that relish , a fast unlimited 4g data only supplier covering central london , tried to extend its service to his area a year ago , but its planning application for a new mast was rejected by southwark council we now feel at an utter loss we would love the council to work with , and encourage , relish to reapply but to date they have not responded to our questions about them belson says that they dont need the worlds fastest broadband wed be happy with 20 30mbps andrew denton between 0 5mbps and 1 7mbpsi live in the village of poole , two miles outside the busy market town of nantwich , cheshire its rural but not remote , with several schools , industrial estates and local small businesses we only recently moved here and , before buying , we used the openreach website postcode check on the property in october 2015 it indicated that broadband was in place and superfast upgrade available , while the connecting cheshire website said it was coming very soon that , and the fact that when we viewed the house the vendor gave us a postcard bt had delivered saying superfast broadband now in your street , gave us enough reassurance and we bought the house facebook twitter pinterest simple email is torturous for andrew denton , who lives in cheshire yet nothing has happened the speed in the village is still poor i run a consulting business from home , and uploading and downloading artwork is impossible , and simple email torturous if i log on to online banking to transfer funds it may take three or four attempts watching hd television or catch up services is almost impossible if we want to watch a sky movie we have to give the tv 24 hours notice so it can download overnight initially , i spoke to openreach to get a quote for a community paid connection the process almost drove me to tears it took me five months and a personal visit to the head office in london to finally get contact with a community fibre officer who could look into this for us yet , after further delays , we were told that to proceed wed have to pay between 15 , 000 to 50 , 000 for the village and , after receipt of this amount , it would take up to a year to get connected i dont think you have to be a rocket scientist to read between the lines with bt they dont want the business instead , we found a private company based in chester its technology group , is offering a simple , effective , cheap solution in a matter of a few months thirty meg up and down speeds , unlimited monthly data , no connection fee theyve been incredible its like finding the holy grail for many of us the only issue is we need 60 households to sign up to make it work commercially for them , and thats 90 of the village , so its taking a while to convince everyone if it does happen , it will make a real difference to a lot of families and businesses paula baxter between 0 2mbps and 0 7mbpswe run a flower farm in foulden in the scottish borders when the broadband is poor its really poor our connection is 0 2mbps on top of this , theres no consistency you think something is loading and its gone again i just want to be able to do things that ordinary people can doevery monday i put out an email to florists in edinburgh saying what flowers we have in stock sometimes it takes until tuesday for the mailing list to upload i manage but it takes 10 times as long i work most evenings until late to catch up tax returns , microsoft office updates everything is online if you dont do things electronically , people think youre a real luddite but im not i just want to be able to do things that ordinary people can do we thought wed be getting an upgrade last year but no im very annoyed about this it got our hopes up apparently were too far from the exchange for bt to upgrade us there are six houses in our hamlet and its the same for all of us our hope is a small local company called briskona , which utilises line of sight technology that is used widely in rural spain and ireland the way it works is that if you can see the mast , you should get a signal theyve been great theres a mast on a hill a few miles away , and theyre moving it higher up the hill to see if it can work for us they havent made us any promises but they are going to try to connect us i know they have been working on it , as one of our neighbours has been watching them with binoculars if it does happen , itll cost 165 to register and then prices start from 17 a month for 5mbps were quietly hopeful are you getting what you pay for \? broadband remains the only essential utility we buy without knowing exactly what we are paying for , so says dan howdle , a telecoms expert at advice website cable co uk , adding no one pays a flat tariff for a mystery quantity of gas , or an unknown number of kilowatt hours , and yet this is exactly the situation with broadband advertised up to speeds are simply fiction for many howdle says ofcom and the advertising standards authority \( asa \) are to announce possible changes to the way speeds are advertised later this year in the meantime , new rules took effect on 31 october broadband adverts , which include pricing , should show all upfront and monthly costs , forcing companies to include line rental in the headline price give greater prominence to the length of the contract and any post discount pricing give greater prominence to upfront costs earlier this year the asa and ofcom said customers found it difficult to calculate the true cost of a contract when presented with ads where broadband , introductory offer , line rental , contract length and one off costs were presented separately , and some elements given greater prominence they found that a hefty 81 of those asked were unable to correctly work out the total cost of a broadband deal howdle adds this change to more honest pricing is a good start , but we have a long way to go yet this article was amended on 29 november 2016 to make clear that steve maine is no longer chief executive of wispire topicsmoneybroadband \(

and 12 39pm , while two for the same broker arrive one after another taking up any of these offers of credit would not be cheap all the firms offer short term high cost borrowing , often at annual rates of more than 1 , 000 payday loan complaints to financial ombudsman nearly triple in a year read morejones , who is in his early 40s and has a wife and young son , is upfront about the fact he opened the door to these lenders a gambling addict , he took out short term loans over a few years , his debts mounting up until he became insolvent in late 2014 recent money worries saw him searching for loans this summer , and the floodgates opened once you put the feelers out , as lots of people do , they start to show their true colours , he says there are firms out there who have taken a lot of flak , but even with that negative press and extra regulation they are still happy to bombard and harass and even lend to someone who has a history of not being able to pay it back and is in insolvency he says he feels like a drug addict being constantly offered temptation addiction is a very complex and difficult thing , he says you have bumps in the road , and when you have those bumps the very last thing you need is temptation my life would be immeasurably easier if my drug of choice wasnt as readily available if it wasnt so in my face it would be less of a problem jones may have fallen victim to what is known as a ping tree , whereby an application is made through a particular type of site that is itself not a lender but a lead generator it passes \( or pings \) your request on to many other firms although the rules around payday loans have been tightened , it seems some lenders and brokers are still playing fast and loose with peoples contact details it is not the first time jones has fallen into this trap several years ago he was being similarly inundated with messages from lenders and brokers , but since then the industry has come under the stewardship of a new regulator , and jones thought things had changed also , his credit record is worse in late 2014 he and his partner entered into an iva , an insolvency arrangement that allows borrowers to negotiate part repayment of their debts over a set period of time at the time the couple could manage to pay 380 a month into the iva after bills and the cost of travelling to work , but this summer the rented home they had lived in for eight years was put on the market and they found that their monthly costs had fallen behind the market rate their new home , in a less nice part of town , costs them 1 , 200 a month , compared with the 800 they were paying , and as a result they are behind on the iva even with negative press and extra regulation they are still happy to bombard and harass someone who is insolventalex jonesdespite the iva jones found he was able to take out new loans from two lenders , neither of whom asked him to disclose previous money problems his terrible credit record proved no barrier in the summer citizens advice said some payday lenders were still flouting the fcas guidance on responsible lending , with around a quarter of borrowers saying they hadnt been asked , or could not remember being asked , about their situation it cited the example of a client who was granted a payday loan following checks despite suffering from depression and alcoholism , having no permanent address , being previously declared bankrupt and having only benefit income for jones the emails and texts flood in , even as the lenders he is now behind with get in touch to ask for payments the iva company is also chasing him he has considered changing his phone number , but at the moment just turns it off he says he doesnt think unsubscribing will make a difference meanwhile , the fca reaffirms that under existing rules lenders are not allowed to send emails telling people that they have been approved for a loan our rules require that firms do not state or imply to customers that credit is available regardless of the customers financial circumstances or status we also require that all communications are clear , fair and not misleading if a financial promotion is misleading it is likely to contravene our rules jones says he wants people to know that lenders and brokers are still aggressively targeting borrowers , despite the new rules if you fill in your details , it doesnt just go to the one company it gets fired out to all of the sharks in the pool over half a million in uk have their debt written off over 'unfair practices' read morecharity urges banthe debt charity stepchange has called on the city watchdog to ban unsolicited calls for high risk financial products such as payday loans firms are contacting people who are financially vulnerable with offers of loans that can cause serious financial harm , says the charitys head of policy peter tutton the problem for many people is they have lost control of their personal data and do not know which organisations have or will use their information and sometimes this can result in being bombarded in a report published on wednesday the charity said that nearly two years on from the introduction of tough regulations , the payday loans market continues to show signs of irresponsible lending and poor treatment of people in financial difficulty it said inappropriate lending was still occurring , people were still building up multiple loans , and affordability checks carried out by lenders were still not always effective in the first six months of the year , stepchange helped 28 , 000 people with payday loan debts , with more than a third \( 37 \) having three or more such debts the average amount owed was 1 , 380 just 17 lower than in 2014 before the regulations came into force however , the proportion of people coming to the charity with payday loan debts has fallen from its peak of 23 prior to the regulations to 16 this year a number of additional rules came into force in january 2015 , including a requirement that interest and fees on all high cost short term credit loans are capped at 0 8 per day of the amount borrowed if borrowers do not repay their loans on time , default charges must not exceed 15 in addition , the total cost \( fees , interest etc \) is capped at 100 of the original sum , which means no borrower will ever pay back more than twice what they borrowed tutton added that the governments digital economy bill , currently going through parliament , was an opportunity to tighten the rules around firms selling and sharing personal data if you are struggling with debts , there are many places you can turn to for free advice they include stepchange debt charity stepchange org or call 0800 138 1111 citizens advice find your local bureau at

how can i restart my career and avoid discrimination now i am using a wheelchair \? i became disabled nearly five years ago , losing the use of my hands gradually over 12 months , with my general mobility becoming more impaired im now transitioning into a wheelchair prior to this id been employed for seven years in middle management with the same employer , and was generally doing well in my career of 15 years i had never had any issues or performance concerns and was considered a high achiever i was made redundant 14 months after becoming disabled , but with a good package i accepted this and moved on i interview well and had a good cv i was offered a new job quite quickly , but when i declared my disability the role disappeared i decided after that to not declare my disabilities until i had my foot in the door , so to speak i did just that , declaring my disability on day one of a new job and was made redundant 11 months later evidence of discrimination was gathered and i was offered a payout cue the next job same thing , same outcome now im 13 months into job four and in the same position i know the signs and am manoeuvring before what i believe to be the inevitable happens i know that the law is on my side regarding discrimination , but taking a legal official complaint route is distressing and unpleasant , and id hate to go through it again i dont want to be in a position where i have to keep on fighting how can i get off this merry go round \? now that i am a wheelchair user at least i dont have the dilemma of whether or not to declare my disability i dont think my support needs are great lightweight equipment \( laptop , phone , etc \) , dictation software \( 80 \) , and wheelchair accessible premises above everything , i need a manager who will support me , but how can i assess that in the job interview process \? what do i need to do differently to not just get a job but keep it \? i dont know how to get my career back on track jeremy saysim very glad you no longer have to make that difficult decision as to whether or not to declare your disability on first contact im pretty sure that , in most cases , its preferable for it to be known from the beginning , but now at least that decision is made for you i am slightly surprised you dont mention any organisations that exist specifically to support people in your situation ive identified several that would seem promising you may , of course , have approached them but found they led nowhere but if you havent , i strongly recommend that you conduct an online search and follow up on those sites that seem to suit you best some organisations specialise in matchmaking would be employees with employers who are actively seeking to take on disabled people what this means , of course , is that youre not in unspoken competition with non disabled people , so theres no question of discrimination coming into play , however unconscious as i have no direct knowledge of any of these organisations , im afraid i cant advise you or make specific recommendations , but do please look into them thoroughly reading your letter again , im struck by how little you have to say about your own particular strengths and experience i suspect that you may , entirely understandably , have become so preoccupied with what you need that youve neglected to make the case for what you can offer in your 20 years work you must have acquired knowledge and specific skills that would be of particular value to potential employers these can prove more attractive to recruiters even if only a minority than more general transferable skills readers say apply for a role at a disability charity or a disabled persons organisation they are used to making adjustments and youd not be judged but id understand if youd feel a little ghetto ised as a disabled person , it took me a long time to find an organisation and a role where i felt comfortable and supported , but theyre out there bristolianlondoner ask lots of questions at interview about the provisions theyd make the attitude they take should give you a good idea as to what theyd be like as an employer horseshoeman apply for civil service jobs all government departments have a robust anti discrimination policy that starts at the application stage , with the guaranteed interview principle for candidates who pass the agreed competency standard katejrrcommuting is driving me crazy its the only fly in the ointment of my dream jobi am blessed in that i have landed my dream job after costly and exhausting retraining , hundreds of hours of voluntary work , dozens of applications and interviews , and a lot of determination and sacrifice , i have a satisfying and challenging job in the charity sector that pays well and in which i feel valued the problem is the commute on good days the drive is 1 hour 20 minutes each way , on bad days more than two hours and it is becoming exhausting public transport isnt really an option due to remote locations i find that my evenings are lost in a haze of tiredness , and i fear know i am becoming unpleasant to be around i used to have hobbies \( cooking , socialising , creative clubs , etc \) but these are no longer viable weekends are invaluable but i am tired a lot of the time is there anything i can do to alleviate this , or do i suck it up \? i dont want to appear ungrateful working from home isnt really an option as i manage volunteers and need to have an office presence i have considered staying in an airbnb during the week but i would be sad not to see my family every evening jeremy saysdriving yourself for four hours a day , and now much of it in the dark , is not only exhausting but also potentially dangerous how about splitting your week \? for example , spending monday and wednesday nights near your place of work and going home the other evenings at the cost of two evenings away you would reduce your double commute from five days to just the one day , friday with the weekend to come i imagine your sympathetic employer would be anxious to help you , so if you could also negotiate the occasional friday working from home , youd eliminate the double commute and have an uninterrupted three days at home readers say i would find a cheapish b b for two nights a week many smaller places would be glad of the regular business , and after a short time you tend to become a friend and be treated better than more casual customers alexandria faced with a similar problem , i moved i have walked or cycled to work for the past 35 years and been doing a job i enjoy and which wasnt stressful work to live , dont live to work derek23 a motorbike cut my commuting time by well over 50 \( legally too \) and had the advantage of making me arrive in work with a smile on my face davgwyn please dont get a motorbike i know how many motorcyclists have been killed on my local stretch of motorway during rush hour , which is slow going but with sudden , lethal lane changing airbnb a couple of nights sebnosedo you need advice on a work issue \?

when hillary clinton relinquished her political dream at the wyndham hotel on wednesday , her voice barely quavered she exuded grace and resilience the woman has a true gift for giving losing speeches some of her supporters , who began demonstrating on the streets to protest donald trumps victory , yearned to hear something else , however they would have preferred at least a dash of the defiant tone that hillary rodham struck in her famous wellesley commencement address in that speech , she talked proudly about how the women in her class were too young to know what was not possible they were going to reshape the ruling order , a pledge that remained unfulfilled in some ways , her defeat was pre ordained , despite all the polls that showed the white house well within her grasp she has been under sustained attack from the right since her husband was elected governor of arkansas in 1978 no one has been more reviled for a longer period of time in american politics although she did not run a flawless campaign , the baggage from all the attacks proved too heavy and caused the historically low trust and likeability numbers that proved insurmountable it made the task of re energizing the obama coalition too daunting and depressed democratic turnout in key battleground states facebook twitter pinterest hillary clinton concession speech i know its painfulearly on , her band of critics seized on her overt feminism and her clinging to her maiden name and legal career in order to calm them over the next 40 years , there were several name changes \( from rodham to rodham clinton to plain clinton \) , style transformations \( from frumpy dresses to the color coded pantsuits and new hairstyles , of course \) and political sea changes from first lady \( of both arkansas and the united states \) , to us senator to secretary of state to two time presidential candidate her distinguished service in those posts only inflamed her haters and the constant shape shifting earned suspicions from the democrats who should have supported her that she was inauthentic her excellent performances in all the debates in 2016 were overshadowed by trumps calling her a nasty woman her fierce determination to seek the presidency a second time , eight years after being defeated by barack obama in the democratic primaries , was seen as evidence that she was relentlessly ambitious her perseverance and resilience were mistaken for power madness for all of this time , the shadow of phony scandals followed her , beginning with a losing real estate venture called whitewater and ending with her private email server fbi director james comeys 99th hour intrusion into the election , coming right as clinton was catching a wave of momentum , seemed to seal her fate all of these strands combined to create a literal no win situation and her final quest may have been doomed from the start its beyond obvious to point out that almost all of the criticism and rage focused on her was laced with sexism and involved gender based double standards when she stayed in the background , went into listening mode and eagerly worked with older , male republicans during her eight year senate tenure , clinton got a respite as secretary of state , she was obamas subservient helpmate , so the hate quieted then , too her position as one of the most admired women in the world was restored but every time she sought the big prize for herself , in 2008 and 2016 , the hatred and caricatures came roaring back facebook twitter pinterest why america elected trumpmillions of dollars fortified the anti hillary movement just months after she stepped over the white house threshold as first lady , a conservative magazine funded by the multi millionaire richard mellon scaife portrayed her as a witch , in black regalia and a pointy hat conservative groups like judicial watch came after her with lawsuits she and her husband had dared and succeeded in breaking the conservative , republican hegemony the right had established during the reagan bush years their fury consumed washington dc through the failed attempt to impeach bill clinton some of the enemies who delighted in attacking her over the decades worked directly for trumps election , including roger stone \( who dates back to the nixon campaign \) , david bossie \( of whitewater vintage \) and stephen bannon who came from the newer rightwing media bastion , breitbart news he was trumps campaign chairman and is said to be a favorite for white house chief of staff a campaign low was when trump brought the women who alleged mistreatment by bill clinton and tormenting from hillary , his supposed enabler , to the second debate hillary clinton , even more than her husband , incited the anger of what she rightly labeled a vast , rightwing conspiracy and no one understood its structure and sharp contours better than her to arm herself , she did what she always did , she studied she turned to trusted advisers for help , like sidney blumenthal , a journalist who wrote a respected book about the conservative movement and to david brock , a turncoat whose journalism had once been funded by scaife they , too , were vilified , for trying to fight fire with fire and building a liberal armada to fight back on clintons behalf but she was always outgunned in letters to friends , clinton expressed occasional despair over the attacks and wearying ethics investigations , all of which have melted away without any charges she told one of her lawyers , robert barnett i am just so tired of all this but she always battled on the feminist writer susan faludi , author of the famous book backlash , also recognized the daunting nature of the fight shortly before the election , she wrote in the new york times the left needs to acknowledge what the right has long known that its a fiction to think we can move on beyond the brawl of the 1990s without settling it , adding , and settling it requires helping mrs clinton triumph once and for all against the calumnies that were created to define her as the feminine face of evil in this election , her name was coupled with lucifers and trump supporters , some dressed in orange or striped prison jumpsuits , demanded she be jailed \( some even shouted that she be killed \) now that they helped bring about her political death , they will surely move on to other targets the endless investigations of clinton will probably , at last , end \( trump has not said a word since the election about putting her on trial \) it is hard to be the first woman in any position of power , but clinton was more than ready to grab the ultimate prize on tuesday night , in the glass encased javits center , her fanbase had everything set for victory , even confetti shaped as glass shards the highest , hardest glass ceiling was about to fall the confetti never fell and at the age of 69 , hillary clinton finally faced the cold reality that she couldnt see as a wellesley student in 1969 it was not possible topicshillary clintonopinionus elections 2016us politicscommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google

detroit based digital artist molly sodas latest book project was borne of instagram , but not in the way you might think when the multimedia artist noticed her photos being removed from instagram for violating the community guidelines , she teamed up with co curator and artist arvida bystrm and put out an open call for submissions of photos banned by the network the resulting project , the book pics or it didnt happen , is due out early next year their subversive project is interesting for its range of imagery banned images include everything from nipples and pubic hair to a woman wearing a hijab and holding an iphone despite building a name for herself in the art world largely through networks like tumblr and instagram , soda says that she regularly thinks about the fact that those platforms dont have her career interests in mind when designing their networks policies i dont feel like instagram as an app necessarily owes me anything , soda explains im willingly using these social media platforms but the internet has set itself up in this guided and streamlined way where everyone follows these rules in order to facilitate whatever it is theyre trying to promote meanwhile , these platforms are huge corporate entities with an entirely different set of interests i dont think many creators realise the reality of what theyre dealing with , including myself indeed , as the internet economy is maturing , this nascent tension between big internet platforms like instagram , youtube , twitter , and facebook and the creators that provide them with content comes into focus platforms need users to create content which elicits the kind of engagement that is attractive to advertisers users need the platforms to reach wide audiences and potential revenue streams , but they want it without fear of censorship however , since few brands want to be sandwiched between racism and pornography , its up to platforms to figure out how to find the sweet spot of policing their networks without prompting frustrated creators to move on to their competitors laura chernikoff is the executive director of the internet creators guild , which was formed earlier this year to represent the interests of creators to big internet companies she says that one of the primary ways this tension manifests is through opaque user guidelines , or the lists of rules which outline what content is liable to be removed or demonetised in response to criticism around content removal , last month facebook publicly admitted that observing global standards for our community is complex and announced that they would be allowing more items that people find newsworthy , significant , or important to the public interest even if they might otherwise violate our standards in september , youtube weathered a backlash from many high profile creators when it tweaked its notification process for content that is deemed advertiser unfriendly , spawning the hashtag youtubepartyover chernikoff explains how the controversy perfectly displayed both sides of the debate the guidelines themselves are very broad and are being enforced by an algorithm without a lot of clear information about what youtube is looking for , people think it has to do with tags , metadata , and titles , but its not known exactly how it works , chernikoff explains however , its easy to understand why the guidelines have to be broad it is youtubes platform and they need to make it a safe space for brands which is a huge part of whats going on here chernikoff notes that compared to other more impenetrable social networks like facebook , youtube has been reaching out to creators and nurturing them though sources say it would be unlikely for youtube \( or any large internet company \) to outline their exact criteria for content removal and or demonetisation because then itd be easier to thwart a spokesperson for youtube contacted by the guardian pointed to an example of that a recent announcement that every creator who has joined the partner programme can get answers via email from a real person at youtube within one business day using snapchat to give a voice to sexual abuse survivors read morewhile our policy of de monetising videos due to advertiser friendly concerns hasnt changed , weve recently improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators , the spokesperson went on to say creators are the lifeblood of youtube and were totally committed to ensuring their growth and success so , whats a creator who wants to make a living on the internet , without fear of their business model being pulled out from underneath them , to do \? chernikoff says across networks , many creators are realising the need to diversify their portfolio and not limit their business model to one thats entirely dependent on a single social network , be it an ad revenue share model such as youtube or a more indirect , brand building route such as instagram indeed , prominent youtubers such as philip defranco have spoken publicly about intentionally tapping other revenue streams , which can include merchandise , direct crowdfunding , brand deals , and other partnerships , to financially underpin their channels frankie greek is a snapchat journalist who frequently speaks about these trends and helps brands make sense of them as a consultant she said much of creators discontent stems from how much the internet has changed in a short amount of time there was a time when the internet was in a way this counter culture , underground thing frankie greekpeople are super resistant to change and there was a time when the internet was in a way this counter culture , underground thing , greek said now , a network like youtube has grown into an enormous community and business model as much as people might think otherwise , youtube is mainstream media now for her part , greek says that watching the evolution of making a living online has influenced her career strategy in addition to her large snapchat following , greek has a professional background in tv and radio production and skills ranging from video editing to hosting live streams and event coverage in a sense , she serves as a kind of poster child for this online diversification strategy im kind of glad that this is the wave of content creators that im on ive been a part of this world for so long as a viewer and you get to see people build these empires , greek says snapchat has been so helpful as shortcut , but im also using my skills in a lot of other ways the best advice i can give to other content creators is to diversify your revenue streams and get out on as many platforms as you can until you find the right formula for you topicsmedia tech networkpublishing and platformssocial mediamarketing prdigital mediatumblrsnapchatsponsored featuresshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

john fearon via email 37 min another free kick for argentina as messi gets fouled outside the box this is an almost perfect angle for la pulga but he drives it against the wall if it carries on like this , it wont be long until we see aguero on the counter , neymar takes it all the way into the box from the right hand side , but instead of delivering a low cross , he shoots it himself and hits the post 33 min as argentina decide to press , brazil stick to the same plan by sitting until opposition enter their half perez drives towards the box and shoots from just outside but it goes wide higuan struggling to stay onside a problem when you play lone striker 29 min that goal certainly shook argentina , who up to that point , were clearly the better team in terms of possession bauza has now instructed his team to press higher up the field as plan a has disintegrated 25 min what a goal by coutinho ! the liverpool man cuts in from the left hand side and drives towards the box and curls it past the keeper this boy is on fire ! 24 min the first real chance by argentina falls to biglia with a great shot from outside of the box and it took a great save from alisson to stop it ! messi worked so well on the right hand side to find the lazio man and he took a powerful shot that was well met by the keeper the best chance of the match 20 min the crowd chant every time neymar touches the ball but aside from that nothing much in terms of real chances an extremely nervy first 20 minutes from both sides thank you for the email , julian of course , no problem hey i live in a country \( china \) where twitter is banned any chance line ups can be written instead of linked to \?

in january 2017 , donald trump will become president of the united states of america , and the most technologically advanced surveillance infrastructure in the world will start reporting directly to him when edward snowden revealed the extent of the national security agencys domestic surveillance regime in 2013 , he warned that a new american president could rapidly expand its scope overnight with just a simple change of government policy a new leader will be elected , snowden said theyll flip the switch , say that because of the crisis , because of the dangers that we face in the world , some new and unpredicted threat , we need more authority , we need more power , and there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it and it will be turnkey tyranny as in many other policy areas , we dont yet know trumps plans for surveillance , but better safe than sorry protecting yourself from surveillance by the nsa isnt easy , but with information security technologies it is possible in fact , its possible to fit the basic guidelines in a tweet , like this from the pseudonymous security researcher the grugq the grugq \( thegrugq \) snowden opsec guide use signal use tor use full disk encryption use a password manager use two factor authsolid basics november 23 , 2015use signalencrypted messaging has got a lot easier over the past few years , particularly with the rise of encrypted texting apps such as signal , developed by open whisper systems the gold standard of encrypted communications is still pgp , an encryption standard first released 25 years ago by phil zimmermann while pgp has the honour of being one of the few encryption systems that the nsa appears to have not developed a workable attack against , it is also tricky to use , with few good mobile options and a number of potential usability hiccups which can result in accidental exposure of information signal , by contrast , is very easy to use the app lets users add each other using their phone numbers , before providing a scannable qr code for double checking that no third party has intercepted the initial communication scan each others qr codes , and if they both flash green , youre good to go you can use signal from then on like a conventional messaging app , even installing a desktop extension so you can chat on the go if switching to another app is too much hassle or if switching friends , family and colleagues to it is there are good alternatives in the commercial sphere both apples imessage and facebooks whatsapp offer end to end encryption , with the latter even using the same open standard developed by signal avoid unencrypted apps such as wechat and google hangouts , as well as apps with an optional encrypted mode like google allo and facebook messenger its too easy to accidentally forget to turn on the encrypted mode , or get lazy and stop using it altogether and definitely avoid email and sms , both of which are sent unencrypted and are easy to intercept use tortor , once called the onion router , is a technology most associated with the dark web the shady part of the internet that hits headlines for being full of illegal material but the technology was created , ironically , by the us state department , to help activists in repressive nations communicate freely online , and its effective for keeping all of your browsing out of the reach of prying eyes it works by parcelling up data into bundles , which are then encrypted multiple times to dictate a path through a network of volunteer computers before reaching the final destination like a game of pass the parcel , each relay node in the network receives the bundle and decrypts one layer , which reveals the instructions for where to pass it on to this means that the destination server doesnt know where the request came from , and the relays in the middle know neither the user nor the destination ideally , the system is secure from eavesdropping tor hidden services , which make up the core of the dark web , are even more secure , as the destination server is itself a fully configured tor node , ensuring the request need never return to the surface web that means that an observer cant tell that a tor user has even visited the site at all , let alone which particular tor user among the companies running tor hidden services are the guardian and facebook in practice , there are more difficulties to using tor than there are signal for one , the nature of the network will make browsing more difficult the limited capacity imposes bandwidth constraints slowing internet speeds , while many sites , uneasy about having users who they cant identify through ip addresses , will block tor entirely additionally , there is more scope for error with tor its possible to mess up and send some information over an unencrypted connection if you arent careful , which can provide a fingerprint that an eavesdropping agency can use to deanonymise you in addition , there have been successful attacks on tor , which work by flooding the network with fake relay points in an attempt to control all of the middle nodes on a given connection if you are in a country which hasnt just elected a populist demagogue president , you can help counter these efforts by setting up your own tor relays use full disk encryptionthis is easier than ever these days on a mac , you will likely have full disk encryption on by default if you are running a recent version of macos check by going to the security and privacy tab of system preferences and clicking on filevault if its turned on , youre good to go on windows 10 , its only slightly harder bitlocker , microsofts full disk encryption feature , isnt on by default , but can be turned on by searching for encryption from the start menu , clicking change device encryption settings then manage bitlocker and turning it on similar settings are available in older versions of windows going back to vista if youre running a version of windows older than vista , you need to upgrade microsoft is no longer issuing security updates for your computer , leaving you essentially undefended against any and all attackers as always , there is a trade off if you forget your passwords when you have full disk encryption turned on , you will not be able to recover your data , ever full disk encryption will only protect you if your computer is actually turned off , or logged out , though if youre in the habit of simply letting it sleep while youre not using it , reconsider use a password manager and two factor authenticationthe final piece of advice is both the best general security advice , and the least relevant for the majority of people when it comes to living under the nsa while encrypted communications are important for protecting users from dragnet style surveillance , where a huge amount of personal communications are automatically intercepted and scanned , fixing passwords wont do much there is no evidence the nsa engages in large scale hacking of accounts not already under investigation but even if you dont worry about being specifically targeted , securing your accounts online is just good sense the actions you take to fight repressive regimes may only end up protecting your bank account , but thats still a positive a password manager , such as 1password , dashlane or lastpass , lets you generate and store random , unguessable passwords , and you should use a unique one for every online account you have you should be doing this as a matter of course even if you only re use passwords on unimportant websites , access can be used to gain greater access whether or not you reuse passwords , services like troy hunts have i been pwned are good too hunt monitors for large scale password dumps , and will email you if any of your accounts have been posted in the internet in security breaches like adobes hack of 152 4m accounts in 2013 two factor authentication , meanwhile , protects you even if you lose your passwords companies including facebook , twitter , google and apple all offer different forms of two factor , requiring you to either enter a code displayed on another device , or approve the sign in , when logging in keep up to datethe nsa is always on the hunt for new , undiscovered , ways to hack into targets , but that doesnt mean it isnt perfectly happy to use tried and tested methods to access information too always keep your software up to date , installing security updates as soon as theyre available , to avoid being targeted through a security weakness which has already been fixed like all the best infosec advice , this will serve you well in your day to day life , too malware like ransomware infections frequently spread by taking advantage of recently patched flaws in software like adobe flash , so keeping that up to date will protect you from the nsa and from common or garden cybercriminals this is also a reason to reconsider your model of phone while apple has a long track record of shipping security updates for devices long after release , the android landscape is more patchy google has promised to update its pixel phones , while manufacturers like samsung keep their top tier handsets , like the galaxy line , up to date but cheaper models are often left with the version of android they ship with forever , meaning they rapidly become insecure thinklastly , use this as a moment to take stock that app youre about to install does it really need to know your location \? does it need access to your contacts \? could information you share publicly be used against you \? what about information you share privately , but through insecure mediums \? do you need to chat to colleagues using your works communication tools , rather than face to face , or even over the phone \? is your archive of thousands of tweets , or millions of facebook interactions , enough for a determined attacker to damage you \? if you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men , i will find something in them which will hang him , wrote cardinal richelieu four hundred years on , and modern

with the best people , he said welch withdrew his support for trump , following the revelations that the president elect thought he could grope women with impunity because he was famous jack welch \( jack welch \) like republican message on economy , security and supreme court unfortunately , wrong messenger party must change nominee now october 8 , 2016 the guardians economics editor larry elliott says americans have gambled on trumps promise that he can shift the the us out of its post financial crisis torpor by cutting taxes and increasing spending even though they run the risk of higher inflation and a bigger budget deficit although trump campaigned as an outsider , his policies have been tried before ronald reagan said his tax cuts and extra spending for the pentagon would generate higher revenues and balance the budget it didnt tax breaks for the rich and military keynesianism sent the deficit rocketing for the time being , all wall street can see is higher growth and bigger corporate profits thats why share prices have been going up you can read larrys whole piece here trump will have to temper his global antagonism , economists saydont panic , too much says berenberg banks chief americas economist mickey levy in a note to clients trump will learn quickly that international affairs are very complex and he will quickly come to rely on the various government agencies and experts that understand and influence the us approaches on international affairs this will serve to soften some of his brash statements during the campaign levy said trumps often outrageous campaign pledges to build a wall with mexico and tear up global trade agreements will fade , with no material follow through or implementation and no wall will be built between mexico and the us china and mexico are two of the uss largest trading partners neither wants to enter a trade war with the us , and neither can afford to do so the us relies heavily on imports from those partners current concerns about major trade barriers being erected are over stated and not realistic luca paolini , chief strategist pictet asset management , declared trump no friend of trade and warned that his protectionist streak poses perhaps the biggest threat to both world growth and financial markets his proposals to raise trade tariffs pledging , among other things , to levy a 45 per cent tax on chinese imports are a worry his denouncement of china as a currency manipulator could also invite retaliation from the worlds second biggest economy at a time when global trade appears to be experiencing a structural decline , trumps stance casts a shadow over the worlds economic prospects bofa merrill lynch downgrades us 2017 growththe bank has cut its forecasts for us gdp growth by 0 5 percentage points in both the first and second quarter of 2017 , and warned of despair in the financial markets it said near term drag shaved 0 5pp from first and second quarter gdp growth , thereby lowering the annual number from 2 1 to 1 8 a more cautious fed we expect 1 rather than 3 fed rate hikes between now and the end of next year with the probability of a december hike falling to 1 in 3 given the high level of uncertainty about the exact policy changes at this stage , we are assuming that trade tensions and fiscal stimulus have offsetting impacts on growth in the medium term while a wide range of outcomes is possible , the risks to the economy seem to be skewed more to the downside trumps economic advisers have accused janet yellen , the chair of the federal reserve , of creating a false economy by keeping interest rates artificially low to help president obama and his democratic opponent hillary clinton trump has attacked yellen throughout his campaign in september he said yellen should be ashamed of herself , i used to hope that the fed was independent , he said in an interview with cnbc and the fed is obviously not independent its obviously not even close to being independent just hours after trumps election , judy shelton , his only female economist adviser , told the ft that trump wanted to a new chair of the fed she said he has made it a very strong point of his campaign that he thinks that the federal reserves intervention and elongated accommodative monetary policy has created a false economy people who have worked all their lives have been penalised by these low rates trump has repeatedly criticised yellen for not raising interest rates fast enough the market expected the fed to raise rates in december , but trumps election has ironically made a rate rise much less likely on tuesday afternoon , when it looked like clinton was odds on to secure the white house the probability of a december rate hike was 81 , according to cme group now it is 67 trump has repeatedly said he is unlikely to nominate yellen to continue as fed chief when her term expires in early 2018 he wants to replace her with a republican who follows his economic thinking the fed increased the benchmark federal funds rate to between 0 25 0 5 in december 2015 , and has held there since due to various national and global uncertainties dominic rushe , us business editor , has been speaking to jack ablin , chief investment officer of bnp private bank ablin was as surprised as many by trumps victory and by the sanguine reaction of the us markets i expected that at the least the markets would give up all the gains that they had made when it looked like clinton was going to win that said it is encouraging that people are seeing opportunities , he said but ablin believes that there are likely to be issues ahead among todays big gainers are pharmaceutical companies investors now believe will escape the price caps clinton had proposed and benefit from trumps pledge to cut regulation but those companies do the majority of their business overseas trump has suggested building a wall around our borders and hes attitude on trade could build a figurative wall around us business ablin believes todays calm is unlikely to last and that trumps inexperience in foreign policy , and his comments on trade , are likely to cause volatility in the weeks and years ahead mexicos

in the long run , i have hopedavid , 43 , colorado , a lifelong republican who voted for hillary clintoni am very disappointed about the result , but i cant be despondent i am by nature an optimistic person so , as the evening wore on and it became clear that trump was going to win , i started thinking about what is actually going to happen after this in the beginning , there will be dark moments , and things will happen that are not good for our country , or for the world im sure that the affordable care act wont survive , for example but then , i believe that the republicans will start to realize that they didnt really get what they wanted trump , after all , isnt a republican he has made that clear he just agrees with them on some things , or claims to i think the first half of trumps term will go very badly for the republicans , voters will become disillusioned , and the midterm elections in 2018 will be disastrous for them democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of congress well get a new supreme court justice , but im not worried about whether theyll be too conservative i would be more worried that they wont be qualified in the long run , though , i have hope i believe in checks and balancesdan , 59 , california , voted for donald trumpits done ! voted shortly after polls open on tuesday and i voted for trump reluctantly no disrespect intended to the third party candidates , but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either trump or clinton so i was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook i chose to vote for the incompetent in the end it wasnt the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that checks and balances would modify the impending chaos the system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter trump than hillary trump has already lost substantial support among the gop so he cant count on either the existing supreme court or congress to ignore him then there is the press what we see is a press overwhelmingly anti trump a vote for hillary means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of hillarys potential malfeasance nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter hillary in any meaningful way so i voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without opposition the establishment underestimated the publics ragegeno , 37 , pennsylvania , voted for jill steinwell , i think were all astounded instead of bushs predictable fifth term , were facing nobody quite knows what i never thought this was a serious possibility until today , but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the publics rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the 1 since the primary was rigged against the only semi progressive major candidate , this was the next prominent way to give the democrats a well deserved heave \( all else aside , its refreshing to see their awfulness finally backfire on them \) im not exactly shocked at that , but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the two party duopoly or help the greens reach federal funding levels the impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the two party status quo more than an actual endorsement of trumps racism or anti intellectualism but the forces hes unleashing are volatile and damn scary as always , the bigger struggle starts after voting positive change only comes from public action , so theres arguably a better chance for it now than under a democratic president if theres no actual policy coming from the oval office , theres space for saner voices to shape it itll be tough , but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back the campaign got younger voters surprisingly engaged and proved that candidates dont have to be owned by corporate money if enough 99 ers remember the power lies with us , we may have a fighting chance after all i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the worldsarah , 28 , florida , voted for hillary clintonhillary clinton lost this election because sexism enabled voters to perceive the most qualified candidate in the world as someone more reprehensible than , bar none , the most despicable person who has ever sought the presidency because the contingent of mostly older , white americans overlooked empathy for minority groups due to their own positions of privilege because of voter apathy because we watched brexit happen and refused to heed its warning i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the world ashamed of my state in particular and dread what consequences it will bring the fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done it should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his campaign , and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe i know the cold fear you are experiencing the only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of us the man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed if you find this rhetoric deplorable , if you are kind , then seize any opportunity to defy it do not wait to speak out until they come for you to clinton , your loss is the nations loss i am sorry they were too blind to see the america im waking up to today scares memonica , 51 , vermont , voted for hillary clintonin my wildest dreams i never would have thought the public would swing so wildly away from reason as to elect someone like trump i grew up in a working class latino family im a liberal but my father was conservative ive been a single mom working multiple jobs to keep a roof over my daughters head and struggled to make ends meet as long as i can remember i understand the feeling that washington doesnt represent the people , but the america im waking up to today scares me and im left with only questions what kind of world will my grandson grow up in \? what will happen to friends and family , people of color who unlike me , werent born here someone once called it my golden ticket \? how could it be a good idea to elect a man who treats women so disrespectfully , makes promises he cant keep , has no interest in learning the nuances of diplomacy , and brags about not paying taxes \? why does the public react so negatively to a woman taking a role of leadership \? where is the critical thinking \? decency and respect have gone out the door in this election and weve just sold our collective soul to the devil a country split in two and at rock bottomchris , 50 , new york , voted for hillary clintonits 3 25am in the morning and im sick to my stomach as i type this the racist won the misogynist won the xenophobe won i guess the moral of the story is dont trust the polls , not even nate silver pundits and experts beyond my station will be dissecting this for years to come and there will be questions how did the republican party allow that reprobate to hijack it \? did the media in their quest for sensationalistic ratings become unwitting dupes providing thousands of hours of free and unfiltered publicity , missing opportunity after opportunity to fact check \? allow the blame game to commence and theres plenty of blame to go around as for me , i blame the democratic party i blame hillary clinton i blame debbie wasserman schultz the republican party has become the party of fascists the democratic party has become the new republican party the faction that sanders represented was the electrified faction , the energized faction and with good reason single payer healthcare , raising the minimum wage , climate change , tuition free state colleges and a variety of other progressive issues resonated with millennials and the working class its unfortunate that sanders version of progressive populism never had a opportunity to go to head to head with trumps regressive cynicism clinton at best personified its my turn , or at its most cynical at least im not trump so many voters \( myself included \) werent actually , they were clearly that wasnt enough and so here we are the unthinkable for at least half the country has happened a trump presidency the severity of this situation cant be understated a country split in two and at rock bottom if youre a woman , if youre muslim , if youre latino , if youre african american , asian , if youre a member of lgbtq community

result the prime minister said she was confident that strong co operation on trade , security and defence would continue with the republican in the white house , despite his presidential campaign pledges to pursue a more protectionist economic policy and isolationist foreign agenda i would like to congratulate donald trump on being elected the next president of the united states , following a hard fought campaign , may said britain and the united states have an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom , democracy and enterprise we are , and will remain , strong and close partners on trade , security and defence i look forward to working with president elect donald trump , building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead no 10 said may had written a personal letter to trump offering her congratulations the foreign secretary , boris johnson , also sent his congratulations to trump i believe passionately in the importance of the uk us relationship and am confident we can take it forward together , he said johnson had previously joked he was hesitant to visit new york because of the real risk of meeting donald trump the european commission president , donald tusk , wrote to trump on wednesday morning to invite him to an eu us summit at your earliest convenience to explore relations for the next four years , having previously joked on twitter that his wife believed there were enough donalds on the world stage corbyn said many in britain would be understandably shocked by donald trumps victory in the us presidential election , the rhetoric around it and what the election result means for the rest of the world , as well as america the victory for the republican outsider should be taken as an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply isnt working for most people , corbyn said , adding it is one that has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards for the majority , both in the us and britain he called trumps victory a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened and said public anger had been reflected in political upheavals around the world some of trumps answers to the issue of economic instability , and the rhetoric he used , were clearly wrong , the labour leader said i have no doubt , however , that the decency and common sense of the american people will prevail , and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants , innovators and democrats after this latest global wakeup call , the need for a real alternative to a failed economic and political system could not be clearer that alternative must be based on working together , social justice and economic renewal , rather than sowing fear and division and the solutions we offer have to improve the lives of everyone , not pit one group of people against another americans have made their choice the urgent necessity is now for us all to work across continents to tackle our common global challenges to secure peace , take action on climate change and deliver economic prosperity and justice farron issued an angry statement after the result , saying the continued rise of the populist right did not have to be inevitable liberal values of moderation , freedom , respect for the rule of law , openness and concern for one another can no longer be taken for granted , he said in the united states last night , those values were defeated but those values are vital if we are to live together in peace , prosperity and freedom those who still believed in a future for liberal values need to fight for them , to win the arguments , to inspire new generations to the great and historic cause of liberalism , farron said never in my lifetime have those liberal values been so under threat , and never have they been more relevant and necessary there is nothing inevitable about the rise of nationalism , protectionism and division the election of canadas prime minister justin trudeau proves that i am determined that together we must make it our mission to build that liberal cause the alternatives are unthinkable among other mps and politicians , reaction was mixed in an emailed statement with the subject line caroline lucas responds to racist being elected us president , the green party mp called trumps election a devastating day for women , for people of colour , for disabled people and for an inclusive society in the usa a hammer blow for the fight against climate change the conservative mp michael fabricant said he was hopeful of closer us uk ties , especially post brexit , given trumps earlier comments that britain would be at the front of the queue for a trade deal much angst being expressed by commentators , he tweeted they said much the same of ronnie reagan who turned out to be a great us president michael fabricant \( mike

victory 1 stunning demonstn of how disempowered low income americans feel by washington politics globalisationnovember 9 , 2016the heart of the issue was the broken contract through the failure of globalised market economics to serve the interests of domestic workers , freeman said its not just words that have to change we need new policies to respond to and address the grassroots failure of our political economy this is the challenge theresa may brilliantly captured in her electrifying conference speech labours stella creasy also drew parallels with the brexit vote in a statement on her facebook page , saying 2016 had set out a generational challenge to everything we thought was ahead for ourselves and our families we can either cower in despair alone or stand up together in dignity for what we believe and work for a better world , she wrote you may feel angry , want someone to blame , just to make it stop but the difficult reality is that leaving this to someone else or shouting at each other will achieve little ukip , the uk party most closely tied to trump , mainly through the support of its interim leader , nigel farage , had little immediate reaction to the result farage himself was on a plane returning to the uk , where he was expected to make a statement of the two main challengers to replace him , paul nuttall had no immediate response , while suzanne evans told the guardian congratulations to president trump thats all im saying now beyond westminster , the archbishop of canterbury , justin welby , said he would pray for the us after the bitter campaign , adding that he hoped trump would be given wisdom , insight and grace during his tenure in the white house scotlands first minister , nicola sturgeon , said that although she was personally disappointed that hillary clinton will not be americas first woman president , her candidacy represented a major step forward for women in america and across the world for that , as well as for her many years of public service , she is owed a deep debt of gratitude she added today many in america and across the world will also feel a real sense of anxiety i hope the president elect will take the opportunity to reach out to those who felt marginalised by his campaign the scottish labour leader , kezia dugdale , said she was heartbroken by the result while we must all respect the result of this democratic contest , today is a dark day for those of us who believe in compassion , tolerance and equality , she said donald trump was responsible for a hate filled campaign that was dominated by

disrupted a little here , which offers its own challenge to england , who had been progressing so serenely until a few minutes ago they look a bit more tested now , with yadav jagging an excellent

time when the ball comes off the toe end of the bat and bounces back over his stumps , the second when he falls over a bit sandwiched right between those two incidents are two runs that bring up the

extreme prejudice a few balls later and this time the ball positively scorches away to the rope
a month ago i tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for president elect donald trump , on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to others i couldnt pull it off there is a darkness about trump that negates that sort of humor a folly so bewildering , an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its depths he has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever in saying so i am not referring to his much criticized business practices or his vulgar remarks about women i mean this in a purely technical sense this man fractured his own party his convention was a fiasco he had no ground game to speak of the list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short he needlessly offended countless groups of people women , hispanics , muslims , disabled people , mothers of crying babies , the bush family , and george will style conservatives , among others he even lost glenn beck , for petes sake and now he is going to be president of the united states the woman we were constantly assured was the best qualified candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time everyone who was anyone rallied around her , and it didnt make any difference the man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the oval office , whence he will hand down his beauty contest verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old order maybe there is a bright side to a trump victory after all , there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him yesterday , and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him he has pledged to drain the swamp of dc corruption , and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task he has promised to renegotiate nafta , and maybe that , too , will finally come to pass maybe hell win so much for us \( as he once predicted in a campaign speech \) that well get sick of winning but lets not deceive ourselves we arent going to win anything what happened on tuesday is a disaster , both for liberalism and for the world as president trump goes about settling scores with his former rivals , picking fights with other countries , and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and that , we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne what we need to focus on now is the obvious question what the hell went wrong \? what species of cluelessness guided our democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our lifetimes \? start at the top yes , she has an impressive resume yes , she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this angry , populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered fine tuning when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine facebook twitter pinterest donald trumps victory speech in full she was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a clinton victory would have moved every democrat in washington up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary matter , something that was taken for granted had winning been the partys number one concern , several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was joe biden , with his powerful plainspoken style , and there was bernie sanders , an inspiring and largely scandal free figure each of them would probably have beaten trump , but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party insiders and so democratic leaders made hillary their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the banks , her fondness for war , and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose hillary even though they knew about her private email server they chose her even though some of those who studied the clinton foundation suspected it was a sketchy proposition to try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a rightwing monster is to court disbelief if trump is a fascist , as liberals often said , democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop him , not a party hack theyd chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats didnt mean what they said about trumps riskiness , that their opportunism took precedence over the countrys well being , or maybe both clintons supporters among the media didnt help much , either it always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the nations papers , but it was the quality of the medias enthusiasm that really harmed her with the same arguments repeated over and over , two or three times a day , with nuance and contrary views all deleted , the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a cold war propaganda station heres what it consisted of hillary was virtually without flaws she was a peerless leader clad in saintly white , a super lawyer , a caring benefactor of women and children , a warrior for social justice her scandals werent real the economy was doing well america was already great working class people werent supporting trump and if they were , it was only because they were botched humans racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the republican candidate how did the journalists crusade fail \? the fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus they chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them they transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting what could possibly have gone wrong with such an approach \? put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery of 2016 the american white collar class just spent the year rallying around a super competent professional \( who really wasnt all that competent \) and either insulting or silencing everyone who didnt accept their assessment and then they lost maybe its time to consider whether theres something about shrill self righteousness , shouted from a position of high social status , that turns people away the even larger problem is that there is a kind of chronic complacency that has been rotting american liberalism for years , a hubris that tells democrats they need do nothing different , they need deliver nothing really to anyone except their friends on the google jet and those nice people at goldman the rest of us are treated as though we have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these democrats are the last thing standing between us and the end of the world it is a liberalism of the rich , it has failed the middle class , and now it has failed on its own terms of electability enough with these comfortable democrats and their cozy washington system enough with clintonism and its prideful air of professional class virtue enough ! topicsus elections 2016opinionus politicsdonald trumphillary clintoncommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
thats it for this blog and the campaign our new york team is up early for a polling day blog us election 2016 voters head to polls as trump and clinton aim to make history live read more hillary clinton has a 70 chance of winning the election , according to a polling day email from the respected pollster nate silver thats up from a 65 chance on sunday night , so clinton has had a good run in the polls in the final days of the campaign clintons projected margin of victory in the popular vote has increased to 3 5 from 2 9 as a lot of you noticed , nevada , north carolina and florida flipped from red to blue over the course of monday we dont think thats a particularly meaningful metric , because the forecasts are probabilistic clintons chances of winning florida increased to 54 from 48 , for instance , which is nontrivial but not an especially large change still , we know its something a lot of readers follow its unlikely that any further states will flip to clinton in our final forecast , as shes too far behind in ohio , the next closest state its possible that florida and north carolina could flip to trump by tomorrow morning , though probably not nevada , where clintons lead is a bit larger who is to blame for not stopping trump sooner \? few suspects spared a mention in jonathan freedlands hall of shame they include the other republican presidential candidates such as jeb bush , marco and ted cruz who allowed themselves to be streamrollered by a reality tv host and serially bankrupted businessman but also trumps trio of enablers rudy giuliani , chris christie and newt gingrich those three horsemen of the republican apocalypse conspired in the lie that a snake oil salesman was fit to be president and destroyed what remained of their reputations in the process plus trumps running mate mike pence the defender of family values who has served as the running mate of a thrice married , serially adulterous , self confessed grabber of women freedland also rounds on the indulgence on a epic scale of the media and there are cameos for julian assange and vladimir putin and finally theres a dig at the us electorate some blame surely attaches to the americans who let trump keep up the bullying and the bigotry and voted for him anyway there is no escaping the fact that north of 40 of the us electorate have been prepared to vote for trump despite everything that he has said and done one poll found 22 of trumps own supporters believed he would start a nuclear war they thought that , but were prepared to vote for him anyway none of them will be able to say we didnt know who is to blame for this awful us election \?

for the past month , while the attention of the world has been fixed on every dramatic twist in the us presidential election , the renewal of armed conflict between india and pakistan has barely touched the headlines in the past few weeks , the two nuclear states have , between them , killed two dozen civilians and injured scores of others in exchanges of artillery fire across the disputed border known as the line of control that divides kashmir into parts controlled by india and pakistan the latest flare up in the long running war of attrition between the two countries comes on the heels of a bloody summer of protest and repression in kashmir that has now been erased from memory by the banging of war drums in delhi and islamabad since july , when the killing of a young militant leader sparked a furious civilian uprising across the kashmir valley , the indian state has responded with singular ruthlessness , killing more than 90 people most shocking of all has been the breaking up of demonstrations with non lethal pellet ammunition , which has blinded hundreds of kashmiri civilians in four months , 17 , 000 adults and children have been injured , nearly five thousand have been arrested , and an entire population spent the summer under the longest curfew in the history of curfews in kashmir all this has been quickly forgotten in the past two months on 18 september , a small group of jihadi fighters , widely believed to have come from pakistan , staged a commando raid on an indian army camp near the northern kashmir town of uri , killing 19 indian soldiers the deadliest attack on indian security forces in kashmir in two decades indian politicians quickly blamed pakistan , which the countrys home minister described as a terrorist state , while pakistani leaders made the implausible claim that india had staged the attack itself to distract from the protests in kashmir the indian prime minister , narendra modi , who came into office promising to take a harder line with pakistan , announced that those behind this despicable attack will not go unpunished at the end of september , india retaliated with what it called a surgical strike against alleged militant camps in pakistan controlled territory , which , according to an army statement , caused significant damage to terrorists pakistan denied the attack ever took place claiming that there had been nothing more than the usual exchange of fire across the border meanwhile , an ugly war of words continued to escalate in tv news studios , some of which were refurbished as pop up war rooms since then , the relationship between the two countries , which is at the best of times characterised by varying degrees of hate depending upon the political temperature in kashmir has soured to the point where both are now suddenly finding spies in each others diplomatic missions a tit for tat nearly every day , on tv , on social media , in ambassadorial corps even in the realm of culture , where india has effectively banned pakistani actors from working in bollywood , and pakistan has banned the screening of indian films in cinemas according to recent reports , civilians caught in the crossfire have been evacuated , hundreds of schools shut , and local residents pressed into service to ferry supplies to troops stationed high in the himalayas as always , the victims of the artillery duels have been the civilians living on either side of a border that did not exist until the middle of the 20th century in the war of words that has followed the bloodshed in uri , the brutal oppression of protest in kashmir has been largely ignored indeed , the indian state , aided by a near militaristic tv news media , has used the uri attack and its aftermath to cover up a surge of killings , maimings and blindings in one of the longest running conflicts in the world this is the story of the bloody summer that kashmiris have endured and of why they will not forget it on 8 july , a militant rebel leader , burhan wani , was shot dead by indian armed forces and police in a remote kashmir village the killing sparked a series of spontaneous demonstrations and protests , which , in a matter of days , turned into a reinvigorated popular revolt against indias dominion over this disputed state wanis path to militancy began in another one of kashmirs bloody summers back in 2010 , when indian security forces killed 120 protesters wani , who was then 15 years old , is said to have joined a small group of homegrown militants after he and his brother were humiliated and abused by indian soldiers over the next few years , he became kashmirs most famous militant commander , and acquired something of a cult following among young kashmiris , who saw him as a symbol of resistance against indian occupation wani was a new breed of militant unlike the first generation of kashmir separatist fighters in the early 1990s , he did not cross over into pakistan he didnt use a nom de guerre , and he amassed a huge following on social media , where he issued brazen challenges to the indian state it was therefore no surprise that thousands attended wanis funeral in his hometown of tral or that those who could not get there organised their own funeral services across the kashmir valley as kashmiris took to the streets , police and paramilitaries were deployed in large numbers across the region thousands of young protesters charged at the armed forces with stones and slogans demanding freedom indian forces responded with lethal effect , firing bullets , cs gas , and metal pellets into the crowds in less than four days , nearly 50 people were killed and thousands injured more people took to the streets to protest against these killings , and the indian forces and kashmiri police killed and injured more of them a cycle of protests connected to the funerals of those protesters were , in turn , fired upon , resulting in yet more killings and blindings by the end of july , india was faced with a full scale popular revolt in kashmir facebook twitter pinterest an indian policeman aims a pellet gun towards kashmiri protesters in srinagar in july composite syed shahriyar syed shahriyar nurphoto via getty imagesthe most recent figures put the number of dead at 94 , including a young kashmiri academic who was battered to death by indian soldiers , and an 11 year old boy , whose body , riddled with hundreds of pellets , was found on the outskirts of srinagar , the joint capital of kashmir , in mid september shockingly , more than 500 people , most of them young , were shot in the face with the pump action pellet guns that the indian forces routinely use to suppress protests these weapons discharge hundreds of small metal pellets , or birdshot , capable of piercing the eye as the uprising continued , the armed forces , by their own admission , fired nearly 4 , 000 cartridges at stone throwing demonstrators , crowds protesting against police brutality , and even onlookers this means that they sent , by one recent estimate , 1 3m metal balls hurtling towards public gatherings predominantly made up of young unarmed people children as young as four and five now have multiple pellets in their retinas , blinding them partially , or fully , for life at the start of september , doctors at kashmirs main hospital reported that on average , one person had their eyes ruptured by pellets every other hour since 9 july it means 12 eye surgeries per day , one doctor told a local newspaper it is shocking on 12 july , the fourth day of the protests , the state government , which is run by a controversial coalition between modis hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party \( bjp \) and a local ally , the peoples democratic party \( pdp \) , finally issued its first official statement on the use of the so called non lethal pellet guns a spokesperson for the government , representing the pdp , described its position to the media we disapprove of it but we will have to persist with this necessary evil till we find a non lethal alternative there is no recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and willfully shooting at people to blind themat first , the statement appeared as a typical soundbite , the sort of thing that officials must compose and recite with studied ambiguity for the press the government version , as its known but i was struck by its cavalier defence of state violence and brutalisation it was obvious that this was not the spokesmans personal view it was a clear articulation of the intent of the indian state in kashmir this was an unprecedented expression of state violence there is no other recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and wilfully shooting at people to blind them at the end of august , according to data obtained by one of indias national newspapers , nearly 6 , 000 civilians had been injured , and at least 972 of them had suffered injuries to their eyes according to official records at smhs , the main hospital in srinagar , 570 people sought treatment after their eyeballs were ruptured by metal pellets ophthalmologists at the hospital performed more surgeries in three days from 10 to 12 july than they had in the past three years many of the wounded were protesters , but not all not one of them deserved to be robbed of their sight by 14 august , as india prepared to celebrate its independence day , kashmir was under a near total blackout i briefly lost touch with my parents , as the state cut off all telephones and the internet i was reminded , once again , of the lines of the late kashmiri american poet agha shahid ali , which still echo 20 years after he wrote them the city from where no news can come is now so visible in its curfewed night that the worst is precise just before the shutdown , i had talked to my youngest sister over whatsapp she was a little girl in the 90s , when kashmir witnessed the first rebellion against indian rule id never imagined my three year old child would see everything that i saw as a child , she told me rebellion against indias rule over kashmir is neither new nor surprising and the brutality of the states response is equally familiar in the 1990s , india came down hard on a widespread uprising in the kashmir valley killing , torturing , disappearing , and imprisoning thousands some estimates put the number of people killed since 1989 at 70 , 000 some 8 , 000 non combatants are thought to have been disappeared , and 6 , 000 are believed to have been buried in mass graves human rights reports have identified thousands of cases of torture , including shocking techniques such as simulated drowning , striping flesh with razor blades and piping petrol into anuses according to a 2012 report in the guardian , government documents revealed that one group of security agents had lopped off the limbs of suspects and fed prisoners with their own flesh in southern kashmir , four girls , aged between 13 and 18 , were shot in their faces as recently as last weekyears later , very little has changed in the indian states response to the demand for self determination from the people of kashmir in a matter of four to five weeks this summer , indian troops , with a clear mandate to be unsparing , wounded over 10 , 000 people one of the youngest five year old zohra was admitted to a hospital in srinagar with lacerations to her abdomen and legs fourteen year old insha was in the family kitchen when a swarm of pellets pierced her face she has lost vision in both eyes in southern kashmir , four girls , aged between 13 and 18 , were shot in their faces last week the prognosis for the youngest of these , 13 year old ifra jan , is not good , a doctor said it is doubtful that these little girls posed a threat to the military force estimated at 700 , 000 soldiers and police stationed in kashmir as the showers of metal pellets were unleashed upon protesters , bystanders and homebound schoolchildren , hospitals in kashmir began to resemble scenes from the great wars of the 20th century rows of beds with blindfolded boys and girls on them , parents waiting anxiously , doctors and paramedics in attendance around the clock on occasion , police and spies also infiltrated the wards to compile profiles of the injured , in order to place them under surveillance after their release the wounded were brought in by the dozen , like birds in the hunting season all of this was incomprehensible , even to longtime observers of violence in kashmir one of the largest military forces on the planet could not be waging a war against seeing perhaps a few aberrations , a crowd control tactic gone woefully wrong one hoped so , but the numbers kept piling up , eye after mutilated eye popping up on the screens of phones and computers , as journalists began to publish their reports as none of the powerful men who run kashmir from delhi expressed qualms about the blinding of children , it became clear that in its hubris the indian state had decided that snatching vision from a few hundred young people was a fair price to pay for keeping kashmir in check perhaps itself blinded by a strain of arrogance peculiar to occupying powers , it continued to pummel a subject population into submission the phrase raqs e bismil , used in mystic persian poetry to denote the passion of the devoted , translates as the dance of the wounded in the slaughterhouse of the kashmir valley , even the grievously injured with pellet scarred eyes or broken limbs have remained defiant we have even got some patients whose guts are perforated and they are asking when they can go back and join the protests , one doctor reported two and a half decades of rebellion in kashmir have hardened the indifference of indias political and intellectual classes to the human cost of the countrys repressive tactics in the valley amid rising nationalist fervour , any sense of the basic rights of a suffering population has been eroded or vanished entirely the hostility now appears to be total , unbridgeable , and for those on the receiving end , unbearable powerful tv studios urge the state to be more aggressively macho , while actively suppressing or distorting news from kashmir one prominent newspaper ran an online poll about the continued use of the pellets that had wounded and blinded so many kashmiris a clear majority voted in support eminent columnists speak calmly of the need for harsh love toward civilian protesters to rationalise the states ruthless response and the twitter account for a government initiative , digital india , posted a poem calling for the army to murder kashmiris until they surrender as images from kashmir began to circulate on the internet despite frequent attempts to block communications , including at least one midnight raid on the offices of a local newspaper , and a blanket ban on one english daily , the kashmir reader pictures of the wounded emerged by the dozen , many of them looking as though they had ruptured fruits where their eyes should have been on the second day of the protests , more than 50 people were admitted to the main hospital in srinagar medics and parents were desperate to save vision in at least one eye for those who had been shot , attempting to extract the jagged and irregular pellets this only happens in a war like situation , a surgeon sent from delhi later said facebook twitter pinterest a kashmiri protester who was shot by indian security forces in srinagar , in july 2016 photograph tauseef mustafa afp getty imagesthe protocol for the use of these crowd control weapons is to aim at the legs to disperse demonstrators but it seems that the paramilitaries and the police have been deliberately firing into faces some may only have minor wounds , some will suffer limited loss of vision , some will lose one eye , some both , and some will be impaired for life , but the pitiless assault on protesting adolescents forces us to ask one question is the indian state happy to blind a generation \? it is inconceivable that policy mandarins in delhi or their advisers in kashmir could be unaware of the destructive power of non lethal weapons earlier this year , the international network of civil liberties organisations and physicians for human rights published a report titled lethal in disguise pellet rounds , it stated , cause an indiscriminate spray of ammunition that spreads widely and cannot be aimed they , therefore , are not only likely to be lethal at close range , but are likely to be inaccurate and indiscriminate at longer ranges , even those recommended by manufacturers for safety many countries have banned police from using ammunition meant for hunting animals the multidirectional spray of pellets was designed to catch prey in flight but many countries have continued to use them as a means of force to control civilian demonstrators in israel , security forces often deploy lethal and non lethal ammunition against palestinian protesters , and crowd control weapons have blinded at least five young palestinians in the last two years the use of rubber bullets by police was banned in the spanish region of catalonia in 2014 , after at least seven people were blinded by them on the streets of barcelona in 2011 , months after the uprising in tahrir square that toppled an egyptian dictator , a young police lieutenant , mohamed el shenawy , became infamous for firing pellets into the eyes of protesters against egypts military government his exemplary skill at blinding civilians earned him the nickname the eye sniper , and his notoriety as a symbol of ongoing state brutality eventually led to a three year jail sentence will india prosecute its own eye snipers \? or outlaw the use of these weapons \? in the countrys present hypernationalist mood , every kind of other is a suspicious figure , a ready made scapegoat for any failure that befalls the politicians determined to make india great again the secessionist kashmiri , the impure dalit , the traitorous beef eating muslim , the woman who speaks her mind , the anti national journalist , the dissenting writer any voices who might call for a ban on these non lethal guns are certain to be ignored to the contrary , ministers and police , and their demagogues and cheerleaders , have continued to advocate the use of both pellets and bullets against protesting crowds in kashmir unruly cattle must be reined in at any cost because kashmiris have become accustomed to the violence inflicted on them as they are to the indifference of the world when pellets were first sprayed at protesters in the heated summer of 2010 , most people processed this as nothing more than a new misfortune just another element of the war in kashmir if one were to draw a diagram of the assaults inflicted on kashmiri bodies over the decades , hardly a single part would remain unmarked in the 1990s , when the violence was at its worst , the eyes were spared now they seem to have become a favourite target the victims of such tactics , consciously and not , cultivate reserves of tolerance for pain , but also a capacity to remember i remember , too i grew up amid the darkness of the late 80s and early 90s i remember that most of us teenagers innately understood that being abused , slapped , or beaten with batons and rifle butts by an indian trooper was a bit of a joke when compared to the horrors that others endured in the dungeons of kashmir \( one of the most notorious torture centres , papa ii a colonial era building on the banks of dal lake in srinagar was refurbished and redecorated , and served as the stately residence of the late pro india politician mufti mohammad sayeed his daughter , as the current chief minister , now presides over the brutalisation of another generation of kashmiri youth \) i remember that the war in those years taught us to treat corpses and shrouds as reminders of passing time , which was measured for the young in massacres and assassinations i recall , too , the tragic rupture in the kashmiri body politic when an atmosphere of fear and loathing forced out the kashmiri pandits a hindu minority that had cohabited with muslim kashmiris for centuries in an almost overnight exodus , many of them targeted and killed by separatist militants sanjay tickoo , who runs an organisation for the welfare of kashmiri hindus , says over the past 20 years , we estimate that 650 pandits were killed in the valley i dont know what happened to sunil and rajesh , my childhood mates from the primary school we all attended near an idyllic river bend in verinag in south kashmir growing up , i experienced a brutal , bleak time , as indias response to the uprising included the grotesque policy of catch and kill , under which combatants and non combatants alike were dispatched in summary executions or tortured to death and yet , i dont remember such a vengeful assault on ordinary people as we are seeing now buoyed by a belligerent nationalist at the helm in delhi , the security forces on the ground perhaps feel emboldened to unleash a more widespread cruelty in 2013 , an affecting photo essay by journalist zahid rafiq in the new york times documented a few of the stories of those who had been blinded by pellets it remains a grim testament to the darkness in kashmir even though the blindings at that time , amid hundreds dead , did not attract too much notice at the time , hardly any indian civil society group or human rights organisation thought fit to speak up about such a wicked crime the wanton demonisation of the kashmiri muslim , a project that some media organisations in india take particular pleasure in , was perhaps fully realised even then it certainly is now , when thousands , fed on a daily diet of nationalist fury , take to social media to celebrate the killing , maiming , and blinding of young kashmiris that the government in kashmir a collection of local elites comprising career politicians , technocrats , and chancers loyal to india considers pellet guns a necessary evil , might make us feel grateful at least they acknowledge the evil part perhaps to address their own guilty consciences a few days into this summers uprising , the kashmir observer , a local english language daily , reported that the local government had deployed a fleet of brand new ambulances to securely ferry visiting vips to picnic spots in the valley this was while protesters were being killed , maimed and blinded and while the ambulances carrying them to hospitals were coming under fire from security forces facebook twitter pinterest victims of police shooting who have been blinded in one or both eyes in hospital in srinagar photograph yawar nazir getty imagesan ophthalmologist at the main hospital in kashmir told the indian express in july for the first time the foreign bodies are irregular edged , which causes more damage once it strikes the eye irregular , sharp edges \? i had assumed that the pellets fired at protesters like rubber or plastic bullets , were round discoid things it turns out that there exist different kinds of pellets , and in 2016 , some indian forces are using the jagged variety which inflict greater damage to flesh and eyes alike , and which doctors say is far more difficult to remove how did india get here \? how is it all right for a constitutionally democratic and secular , modern nation to blind scores of civilians in a region it controls \? not an authoritarian state , not a crackpot dictatorship , not a rogue nation or warlord outside of legal and ethical commitments to international statutes , but a democratic country , a member of the comity of nations how are indias leaders , thinkers and its thundering televised custodians of public and private morality , all untroubled by the sight of a child whose heart has been penetrated by metal pellets \? this is the kind of cruelty we expect from assads syria , not the worlds largest democracy historically , such an inhuman response to an uprising to mass dissent has been the province of empires and tyrants a modern democratic nation rarely unleashes such violence , except upon victims whom it does not regard as its own people it is quite clear that for india and its rulers , kashmiris have been subjects and not citizens for as long as kashmiris have refused indian rule you do not shower projectiles that target eyes and viscera on a people you consider your own in snatching away the vision of kashmiri children , the indian state has decisively announced that it has only one message with a hubris derived from its might and military dominion over kashmir , the state convinces itself that it has the power to inflict blindness in no time , then , it blinds itself too to the character of democracy that is its central founding principle the harsh repression of kashmiri protests , the nobel prize winning indian economist amartya sen declared in july , is the biggest blot on indias democracy it is hard not to see this mood of brutality connected , at the very least in its tenor , to the larger register of extreme violence , by both state and non state actors , that has come to be normalised over the last couple of decades there has been some dissent in india journalists , activists , even some politicians , have written elegiac columns and essays on the savage response to the rebellion in kashmir they have implored their government to cease the brutality , to be kind , and to talk to kashmiris but it appears that the indian government , clouded by a newfound chauvinism and a hunger for votes , is in no mood to listen to the nations voices of sanity in august , only a few days after indian forces in srinagar murdered a 21 year old cash machine watchman by firing 300 pellets into his body from close range , the indian prime minister used a speech on kashmir to taunt pakistan over its own atrocities against separatists in the province of balochistan , where the pakistani army has inflicted forced disappearances and summary executions on the baloch people pakistan forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter planes , he said but modi chose to forget that his own forces had , by then , killed scores of young kashmiris we need to interrogate the circumstances that have led to the deliberate blinding of hundreds of young people at the hands of armed forces in kashmir , before this too is forgotten as some of the wounded have begun to heal , some accounts have suggested that the damage may have been less severe than initially feared that perhaps many of those who underwent eye surgery will regain some vision in at least one eye this might make one feel better relieved that its not worse but there is something wrong with that kind of moral reckoning , akin to the indian security officials who continue to maintain that pellet guns must be used because the alternative would be worse one security official told an indian news website that pellet guns had actually saved lives it is unfortunate that there have been eye injuries but the pellets are less lethal than getting hit by bullets so we might ask what if the armed forces stationed in kashmir had fired live bullets instead \? but this doesnt compute in 2016 , the security forces have already killed nearly 100 civilians is that an acceptable number \? in a year or two , as india , and pakistan , continue to harp on their territorialist positions , there will arrive a season of surface calm a return to normalcy in kashmir people will shop , marry off their children , and celebrate an uncurfewed eid they will also welcome tourists in their blighted land but when this new generation of freedom seekers grows up into blinded , maimed , adulthood , they will carry our guilt ridden consciences for us they will remember more than they have seen they will certainly remember the country that did this to them follow the long read on twitter at gdnlongread , or sign up to the long read weekly email here topicsthe long readindiapakistanfeaturesshare

there has arguably not been a us presidential election with so much at stake for the rest of the world since the second world war one candidate stands largely for continuity , signalling she would do slightly more than her predecessor to shore up the existing liberal world order her opponent is vowing to turn that order on its head , jettisoning alliances and free trade agreements , while seeking to cut deals with the worlds authoritarian powers if donald trump is elected on tuesday , it is likely to trigger a foreign policy crisis inside washington , as the diplomatic and security establishments scramble to discover whether he meant what he said on the campaign trail those who believe that the election talk was all bluster and that trump will tack back to a more traditional republican foreign policy once elected are likely to be disappointed , according to thomas wright , an analyst at the brookings institution in washington us election trump and clinton in tight race on campaign 's final day live read more my view is he is a more ideological candidate than we often appreciate and while there is a lot of bluster and a lot of ignorance on a wide number of issues , there are certain things that he has been pretty consistent on , wright said i think he is opposed to us alliances and i think he would try to withdraw the us from security commitments around the world he is anti trade and he would veer towards a more mercantilist system , and he is pro russian he is pro authoritarian some believe that trump would be confronted with a series of resignations by diplomats and generals if he tried to turn these campaign platforms into administration policy if , on the other hand , hillary clinton wins the electoral college vote , she will face the opposite dilemma how to distinguish her foreign policy from barack obamas she has expressed an inclination toward a tougher stance in syria and in europe , for example , but the wiggle room for a change of policy has shrunk with every passing week as vladimir putin has sought to create new facts on the ground in the last stages of the obama era more weeks would go by while a new clinton administration dives into an inevitable policy review however , events around the globe may not wait that long whoever sits down at the desk in the oval office on 20 january next year may be forced to take some of the toughest decisions any us president has taken , much sooner than he or she would want us faces host of global threats during transition until next president read morenorth koreaus power and influence is being challenged around the world at an accelerating rate , and nowhere more so than on the korean peninsula the north korean leader , kim jong un , has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a missile , and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so yet , they will soon it is also widely anticipated that in the next few years , north korea will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us west coast former and current us administrations have taken the strategic decision that pyongyang should be prevented from reaching that point , by force if necessary but the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next president clintons foreign policy advisers have signalled that she would focus on the looming korean crisis early in her term in office , reassuring japan and south korea that the us will not abandon them , and seeking to put pressure on china to enforce un mandated trade sanctions more effectively that may well not succeed , leaving a clinton administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of dialogue with pyongyang and accepting its nuclear weapons status , as long as it restricts missile development if that were possible , it would alarm us allies who are already within north korean missile range american allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if trump reaches the oval office he has questioned the value of us alliances in the region , and he has floated the possibility that countries like japan or south korea should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the us strategic umbrella if he sticks to that policy in office , there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in north east asia and possibly beyond ultimately , a trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a north korean long range missile he has said he would put more pressure on china to get tough with its neighbour , and he has said he is willing to meet kim in the us , on the grounds theres a 10 or a 20 chance that i can talk him out of those damn nukes failing that , he has signalled he is quite willing to contemplate using the us nuclear arsenal if the weapons cannot be used , he asked then why are we making them \? why do we make them \? china china tantalized by us election mayhem and prospect of 'thug' trump as president read morewithin his or her first year in office , a new us president would also face a direct challenge to us power in the western pacific the chinese programme of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the south china sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives beijing potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world us influence is under further threat by the rise of rodrigo duterte in the philippines , who has threatened to eject us troops , casting doubt on his predecessors agreement to allow new permanent american presence clintons likely policy will be to continue obamas faltering pivot to asia , and to prioritise restoring the faith of us allies in the region that washington will help them resist chinese attempts to dominate the south china sea it is a policy that is held hostage to some extent by dutertes ultimate intentions , and it could lead to a rapid escalation of tension in the region trump has pointed to the chinese reef building programme as a reflection of us weakness but has not said what he would do about it he has focused more on the threat posed to the us by its trade relations with china in the transactional model of foreign relations trump favours , he could agree to turn a blind eye to creeping chinese takeover in the south china sea in exchange for a bilateral trade deal with beijing on better terms syria why clinton 's plans for no fly zones in syria could provoke us russia conflict read morea new us president will arrive in office at a time of significant military advances against islamic state in syria and neighbouring iraq , but diminishing options when it comes to helping shape the opposition battle against the assad regime and its russian and iranian backers it is possible that the rebel stand in aleppo will have fallen by then , giving the regime the upper hand and postponing yet again any hopes of a political transition in the presidential debates , clinton talked of establishing a no fly zone or a safe zone inside syria however , it is hard to see how that would be done without risking a direct clash with russia , with all the risks that entails the generals at the pentagon , who have long argued against the feasibility of establishing such a zone , would work hard to block such a scheme a clinton white house is also likely to explore ways of increasing the flow of arms to moderate opposition groups trump has indicated that he would seek to work with assad and putin in a combined fight against isis , and has not voiced criticism of the bombardment of rebel held areas such as eastern aleppo that policy would also have heavy costs the syrian opposition and the gulf states would see it as a betrayal , and the new administration would have to deal with the reality that neither the regime nor russia has much immediate interest in fighting isis russia and ukrainea clinton administration is expected to take a tougher line with moscow than the obama white house , all the more so because of the substantial evidence of the kremlins efforts to try to intervene in the us presidential election in her opponents favour clinton could well seek to take a leadership role in negotiations with moscow over ukraine and the stalled minsk peace process , which have hitherto been left to germany and france she could also opt to send lethal aid to ukraine as a way of increasing us leverage how the world views the us elections , from israel to north korea read moretrump is likely to take the opposite approach he avoided criticism of russia for its actions in ukraine , hinted he might accept the annexation of crimea , and ignored us intelligence findings that moscow was behind the hacking of democratic partys email a trump administration is unlikely to contest russian enforcement of its influence in eastern ukraine europe and natoclinton aides have signalled consistently that one of her priorities would be to show us willingness to shore up eu and nato cohesion , and will attend summits of both organisations in february trump has suggested , by contrast , that nato is obsolete and questioned whether its security commitments in europe are worth what the us is currently spending on them he said he would check whether us allies fulfilled their obligation to us before coming to their defence , calling into question the purpose of the defence pact later in the campaign , he changed tack , saying he would seek to strengthen the alliance , but a win for trump on tuesday would nonetheless deepen anxiety in eastern european countries , such as the baltic states , that a us led nato would come to their defence in the face of russian encroachment tradethe two major free trade projects of the obama administration , the transatlantic trade and investment partnership with europe \( ttip \) and the trans pacific partnership \( tpp \) with the countries on the pacific rim , will probably still be under negotiation when the new president comes into office , giving him or her the option of killing or completing them clinton first supported the tpp and then criticised it in the face of the primary challenge from bernie sanders her reservations may prolong the negotiations , but she is ultimately expected to pursue and seek completion of the ambitious multilateral trade deals trump built his campaign on opposition to all such deals , which he has characterised as inherently unfavourable to the us he has promised to seek bilateral trade deals on better terms and to punish other countries deemed to be trading unfairly with sanctions , ignoring the threat of retaliation climate changetrump has promised to withdraw the us from the paris climate accord , which comes into force on friday , and to stop all payments of us tax dollars to un global warming programs the republican presidential nominee has said hes not a believer in climate change , describing it as a chinese created hoax , and has castigated efforts to reduce greenhouse gases as a risk to american jobs the prospect of trump in the oval office poses a unique challenge to the paris deal , which was struck last year and ratified in speedy fashion in october a total of 94 nations have fully signed up to a commitment to keep global temperatures below a 2c increase on pre industrial times , in the hope of staving off catastrophic sea level rises , heatwaves and extreme weather the emissions cuts pledged by countries currently arent enough to avoid climate calamity , meaning that recalcitrance from the us , the worlds second largest emitter and the global leader in fighting climate change , according to barack obama , would risk ossifying a process that needs a further hefty shove american involvement in the paris deal which has the support of nearly 200 other countries is based upon the presidential scrawl of obama the accord wasnt presented to congress as a formal treaty , meaning that trump could undo it himself extricating the us from the deal , along with its financial support of countries particularly vulnerable to climate change , would take some time , however now the agreement is in force , any signatory nation faces a three year delay before it could opt out , with a further one year wait as the process plays out that means , said robert stavins , an expert at environmental law at harvard university , it would be impossible for a president trump to remove the united states during what would be his first term but the uncertainty would undoubtably spook countries that rushed to embrace the paris deal after the us and china , the worlds two greenhouse gas superpowers , jointly announced they were committed to the process last year some countries , aware of the dangers of climate change , may redouble their efforts to slash emissions but others may use it as a convenient excuse to slack off trumps antipathy to climate action is underscored by fierce support for fossil fuels , telling coal miners that he will put you back to work and that gas will be a beautiful thing in his administration its also likely that he would scrap obamas clean power plan , the centerpiece policy to curb emissions from power plants , and allow projects such as the controversial dakota access pipeline , in which he is indirectly invested us emissions , which have begun to level off in recent years , could start climbing again topicsus elections 2016hillary clintondonald trumpus foreign policyrussiasyrianewsshare

the supporters of an open , democratic internet , funded mainly by advertising , are facing some big questions about how their vision will unfold a freely accessible digital world , where websites and social networks are open to all , is the dream of many but critics wonder if this is desirable or even possible brands have shifted a huge proportion of their marketing budgets into online advertising in recent years , fuelling the growth of the internet and becoming the main source of funding for most websites and social networks but while many campaigns hit the spot , others can be irritating , intrusive and irrelevant how can advertisers and web publishers make sure ad campaigns are effective and entertaining enough to pay the internets bills , while ensuring online services dont disappear behind a series of privately accessed paywalls \? to discuss the future of online advertising , the guardian teamed up with advertising technology provider appnexus to run a roundtable discussion the discussion was conducted under the chatham house rule , where comments were made on condition that they were not attributed to the speakers , to encourage a free flowing discussion a key point of contention in the discussion was how the internet should be funded one participant was passionate about the ad funded model largely it should be free it is a wonderful tool for accessing information , for consuming information and for the distribution of brands but another thought that the quality of content on the internet inevitably suffers unless you have the resources to fund it there are fears that ad revenue is insufficient to pay for all the content that is needed for the web generally speaking , the ad funded model puts a downward pressure on the quality of content i have no problem with subscriptions , the speaker said , adding there is no reason why it should be free digital advertising faces some serious challenges if it is to keep the web free one of which is concerns over the ethics of tracking peoples online behaviour without their consent the success of online ad campaigns is determined by the data that brands can access about internet users how old are they \? what are their interests \? are they male or female , single or with children \? much of this data will be collected from cookies downloaded on to users computers cookie data allows web publishers to track users online journeys and observe the actions they take on different websites they can then use this data to helps them target campaigns to different groups the impact of data protection regulationbut the forthcoming european union general data protection regulation \( gdpr \) , to be implemented in 2018 , will tighten up data privacy and this , some speakers felt , could undermine the ad funded model of the internet the stringent new rules , which force companies to get unambiguous consent from online users to make use of their data , are expected to be adopted in the uk regardless of brexit some participants worried that the directives clampdown on using data could make it difficult for certain companies to operate on the internet or to run advertising campaigns some businesses may not survive , warned one speaker the participants also discussed whether website owners relying mainly on cookie data are at a disadvantage to websites and social networks where users log in and give their personal details facebook , for instance , has in depth login information about users their locations , names , likes , activities and friendship networks the social network offers this data to brands , facilitating highly targeted advertising campaigns one participant spoke of an ad campaign for the launch of a new product where a strong creative film was shown on facebook depending on how users reacted to the film whether they watched it the whole way through , or just with the sound off more messages were served to them and these were refined in stages according to each users reaction the speaker said this was highly effective , as it allowed the campaign to filter out those who were not interested and to deliver relevant messages to potential customers another speaker said facebook allows brands to constantly change their online advertising as they receive new data about peoples likes and dislikes i really feel it is only since facebook has come along that we have had this opportunity to assess data very quickly and then tweak that data but another pointed to a recent statement from household products manufacturer procter gamble \( p g \) , the worlds largest advertiser , that it had decided to stop using facebooks targeting tools they had assumed it would be efficient to target \( air freshener \) febreze to families with kids and dog owners , but it proved more efficient to go broad in the targeting p g said it was better to promote some products to everybody rather than paying for targeted audiences , as everyone uses laundry detergents or washing up liquid tightly targeted campaigns are more suitable for very specific , niche products some of the speakers were concerned that online advertising places too much emphasis on data and not enough on creativity and persuasion the use of data was criticised as the tail wagging the dog and there was a recognition that some advertising creatives believe data gets in the way of making good campaigns they feel the use of data depersonalises , said one speaker , who added the caveat that attitudes are changing i think people have got used to the fact it is not a case of either having data or creative it is about using both together there was a consensus that cookie and login data works best for hard sell campaigns , encouraging people to buy now , rather than for softer focus , persuasive brand advertising retargeting a waste \? and speakers accepted that retargeting campaigns whereby a user who has visited a website , perhaps to look at some shoes , then has ads for that website follow them around the internet for days , weeks or even months after are unpopular with users it is so frustrating as an advertiser that i am spending on retargeting , said one speaker i am very well aware that those advertising platforms arent good enough and that we are overly retargeting the problem of retargeting was seen as a failing of automated advertising called programmatic advertising where software dictates what ads people see based on the data but some thought that as programmatic technology evolves to become more sophisticated , it will overcome these drawbacks and will deliver a better experience for users and brands facebook twitter pinterest ogilvyones jo coombs gets her point across at the guardian roundtable event , supported by app nexus photograph sam friedrichone problem with automated online advertising is that the ads may appear on any website and next to inappropriate content , for instance an ad for an airline could be placed next to an article about an air crash but one speaker predicted that automated programmatic advertising will be able to answer this problem and help brands sift through data to find the most receptive audiences for their messages and identify the most appropriate places to run the ads programmatic is very helpful for understanding who those people could be , what their behaviour looks like and how you could go about finding them another compared the situation of programmatic advertising to email email is one of the best performing channels but it was tainted for a time because it was abused the discussion turned to the use of machine learning , where software analyses data to make judgements about what products , ads and content people should be offered one speaker said machine learning and robotics would revolutionise marketing what weve seen in programmatic advertising is one of the earliest areas where it has made inroads , but i think it will be right across the shop but another warned that widespread use of robotics and technology would lead to a depersonalised world people are just turning into a kind of jelly between lots of robots the discussion returned to the question of whether advertising will continue as the main source of funding for the web one speaker thought younger users would be reluctant to ever pay for online content but another disagreed we cannot assume that people between the ages of 12 and 21 are going to behave and operate like that for the rest of their lives we all go through generational change at the tablejasper jackson \( chair \) assistant media editor , the guardiansanjeevan bala head of data planning and analytics , channel 4romain bertrand managing director , eharmony uksteve chester director of data and industry programmes , iab ukchris clarke chief creative officer , international digitaslbijo coombs ceo ogilvyonenigel gilbert vice president , strategic development , emea , appnexusannabel kilner commercial director , made comsille opstrup head of digital , pernod ricard ukgiles pavey chief data scientist , dunnhumbydaniel spears programmatic director , the guardianbradley love professor of cognitive and decision sciences , uclsarah todd ceo , geometry globaljamie west deputy managing director , group director of advanced advertising , sky media uktopicsmedia tech networkappnexus roundtableadvertisingsponsored featuresshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

anyone who has seen the documentary weiner may not have been entirely surprised that it was former congressman anthony weiner who threw a late spanner in the works of hillary clintons campaign the film charts in excruciating detail the collapse of a political career and , ultimately , of a marriage weiners laptop is now reportedly under scrutiny by the fbi lest it contain emails pertinent to clintons private server but if there is a movie sequel to be made , it might be called podesta an avalanche of tens of thousands of other messages , hacked from clinton campaign chairman john podestas gmail account and released by wikileaks in regular bursts over the past month , has provided an unprecedented window on the inner workings of a presidential run there , laid bare with all the brutal candour of a fly on the wall documentary , are the office politics , the egos , the cliques , the evolving attempts to package a candidate who admits she is not a natural political performer like her husband or barack obama the hoard offers insights that would not normally see the light of day until memoirs published years or decades hence the clinton campaign has blamed the russian government for breaking into podestas account and passing on the material to wikileaks in an attempt to help donald trump win next weeks election it has generally declined to confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails , but podesta , a veteran of nearly half a century of us politics , says he has spoken to the fbi as a victim of hacking trump adviser reveals how assange ally warned him about leaked clinton emails read moreclintons handling of classified information as secretary of state which flared up again last week thanks to weiner has cast a shadow over her entire campaign and been a source of much angst at her headquarters when the issue first reached public attention in march last year , podesta wrote of three fellow clinton aides speaking of transparency , our friends david kendall , cheryl mills and philippe reines sure werent forthcoming on the facts here the message was sent to neera tanden , president of the center for american progress thinktank in washington , who has a regular cameo in the emails she wrote back this is a cheryl special know you love her , but this stuff is like her achilles heal sic or kryptonite why didnt they get this stuff out like 18 months ago \? so crazy podesta replied unbelievable tanden added i guess i know the answer they wanted to get away with it facebook twitter pinterest hillary clinton there is no case in fbi email investigation videoboth tanden and podesta are unswervingly loyal to clinton , but could be described as critical friends in another exchange in september 2015 , podesta warned that the campaign has taken on a lot of water that wont be easy to pump out of the boat most of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre campaign , but a lot has to do with her instincts shes nervous so prepping more and performing better got to do something to pump up excitement but not certain how to do that tanden assented almost no one knows better than me that her instincts can be terrible when the seemingly innocuous leftwing senator bernie sanders came out of nowhere to challenge clinton in the democratic primary , there were fears of a repeat of her shock defeat by obama in 2008 tanden warned podesta against attacking sanders too aggressively just game out what that does to hillary , she wrote in august last year when we went after obama , she got killed for it reaffirmed all her negatives , strengthened him we had no idea it was kryptonite for us to do that , but it was i dont know if it was obama or hillary \( i suspected hillary \) , but its really something to focus group beforehand in december , when tanden wrote in praise of the paris climate deal , podesta responded can you believe that doofus bernie attacked it \? then , in march this year , clinton strategist minyon moore opined i think sanders is a rule breaker and has no institutional loyalty to the democratic party we should expect him to ignore the rules and persist in his quest to flip superdelegates despite overwhelming evidence that reflects his considerable weaknesses with the democratic base and no doubt in the general tanden , meanwhile , pulled no punches when clintons campaign hesitated over whether to condemn democratic activist david brock for demanding sanders medical records she wrote hillary god her instincts are suboptimal a stout defender of clinton in public , in private tanden injects some bracing honesty that suggests the candidate is not surrounded by sycophants after the former first lady described herself as a moderate , tanden asked of podesta why did she call herself a moderate \? he wrote back i pushed her on this on sunday night she claims she didnt remember saying it not sure i believe her tanden replied i mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter i know shes actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues it worries me more that she doesnt seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment the daily dump of stolen emails has uncovered clintons lucrative wall street speeches , lists of 39 potential vice presidents and 84 potential campaign slogans , fresh questions over a conflict of interest with the clinton foundation and alleged advance warnings of debate questions but there have been few revelations likely to alter the course of the race for the white house in fact , just as wikileaks release of us embassy cables often showed diplomats judgment in a flattering light , so the podesta emails have illuminated a micromanaged campaign operation with a laser like focus and little by way of ill discipline or even foul language the nerve centre is , however , all too aware of its candidates weaknesses and sensitive to media criticism , and as prone as any other office to personality clashes , terse exchanges and mutual exasperation the email treasure trove also lifts the lid on the complications of celebrity endorsements in august 2015 , betsy jones , assistant to the hip hop star q tip , wrote to podesta to propose a meeting with clinton to discuss ways he can be used as bridge to the hip hop generation during the 2016 presidential campaign q tip even served as dj for chelsea clintons 25th birthday party in 2005 , she noted podesta forwarded the email to colleagues , one of whom was weiners wife huma abedin q tip \? seriously \? she wrote i am so old another , kristina schake , weighed in ive actually seen q tip in concert and if this meeting happens i would like to staff her she elaborated with both the beastie boys and the chemical brothers ! but then the conversation took a darker turn when another member of clinton staff , presumably responsible for background checks , raised concerns over q tip there are a couple of altercations he pleaded guilty to , but they were from a while back however , more recently shouted pigs at nypd officers while protesting the grand jury decision not to indict darren wilson it took a while , but the meeting did go ahead facebook twitter pinterest vote for someone who cares beyonc and jay z back clinton as woman for jobthen there are campaign surrogates who go rogue lanny davis , a lawyer and former special counsel to bill clinton during his presidency , put his foot in it when talking about clintons email server on tv later that day robby mook , now the campaign manager , emailed podesta we gotta zap lanny out of our universe cant believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on tv in may last year , podesta wrote of longtime clinton family friend sidney blumenthal it always amazes me that people like sid either completely lack self awareness or self respect maybe both will you promise to shoot me if i ever end up like that \? podesta , 67 , runs a tight ship and has an unenviable job countless people want to give him advice or meet him for dinner in september last year , columnist brent budowsky wrote a long , panicked email about visiting a university campus where sanders had a booth but clinton did not this is happening at every major campus in america , he warned darkly referring to a politico story about attacks on sanders by clinton surrogates , budowsky went on the way not to handle bernie is to telegraph how afraid the clinton campaign is of him , and then dispense covert talking points that cannot be put in writing that embody the oldest politics that will only infuriate many liberal democrats and give an already biased media a legitimate story line to push podesta gave a characterically brisk response that ended why do you think that story is not just a bunch of hyped up bs intended to have exactly the kind of reaction you are exhibiting \?

once upon a time , a long , long , long time ago , small children might get told off for being loud or unruly or , as we called it then , disruptive now \? not so much in 2016 , its cool to be disruptive its what every startup in silicon valley is straining to do its what airbnb has done disrupting the hotel industry as uber has disrupted taxis and amazon has disrupted bookshops and almost everything else two years ago i went to a conference in san francisco , techcrunch disrupt , and met many people claiming to disrupt many things , including , in one case , socks but what no one anticipated was that , though it may be convenient to summon a motor vehicle to ones home with a tap of a button or to buy things online while wearing pyjamas and possibly drunk , it might also lead to where we are now 6 november 2016 two days , potentially , before the world changes forever because donald trump is not just an over tanned reality tv star gone rogue he is not a weaponised version of lord sugar he is what happens when technology changes everything disruption , wrote clayton christensen , the professor at harvard business school who coined the idea , is the technology mudslide hypothesis its how some scrappy little upstart like microsoft overthrew the colossus that once was ibm its how some small new technological breakthrough can have huge , unexpected , world changing consequences its donald trump the living , breathing version of the scrappy little upstart that overturns an entire industry only this time its not an industry , its democracy we have fetishised disruption governments have stood by and watched it take down all industries in its path the market must do what the market must do only now , the wave is breaking on its shore because what the last week of this presidential campaign has shown us is that technology has disrupted , is disrupting , is threatening to upturn the democratic process itself the best , most stable , most equitable form of governance the world has yet come up with in many crucial ways , it doesnt even matter who wins on tuesday because perhaps the best thing you can say about trump is that if it hadnt been him it would have been someone else its the opposite of the great man theory of history a misogynistic ex reality tv star is not the game changer here , its technology two days ago , the same hackers who took down twitter and netflix and the and reddit and cnn last week in the biggest attack of its kind that the world has ever seen , started practising on a country computer malware had been used to infect inanimate objects in our homes the connected devices that comprise the so called internet of things and that , its been discovered , a bit late , are hopelessly insecure it has harnessed these to create a gigantic internet destroying machine , the so called mirai botnet , and its honing its power last week it took aim at an entire country liberia a huge attack was launched against the two companies that own the only fibre going into the west african country bringing its entire internet infrastructure to a halt the worst case scenario \? that the hackers behind it are practising for tuesday , when theyll aim their massed computing power against america this is everyday objects in our own homes , smart objects , intenet enabled toasters and refrigerators because this is where we are our toasters and refrigerators may be about to be used to subvert the democratic process of the greatest democracy on earth and if that reads like the most lunatic sentence youve ever read , you maybe havent been paying close enough attention to 2016 because this is possibly , finally , the year when it hits home that technology is not just some cool titanium coloured gadget in our pockets its the facilitator of the degraded news space that treats facts and lies the same that has enabled thousands of twitterbots algorithms to scrape the internet for stories about trump and then retweet them it was robot accounts that caused trumpwon to trend after each tv debate and allowed trump to claim victory its how a man who hasnt set foot on the street for four years , can , with just his laptop , create havoc in the critical last week of the campaign by leaking emails that potentially implicate hillary clinton , julian assange has inserted himself like computer malware into the heart of the american democratic process hes infected it he is , like donald trump , the law of unintended consequences writ large , in human form in 2010 , we didnt mind the fact that the data he leaked was stolen here in the liberal press , we championed it because it was stolen data that served to underscore our liberal sensibilities or , at least mine and now \? not so much but then technology is neutral there is no left or right there is only hackers and twitterbots and 16 year olds in macedonia who , buzzfeed reported last week , earn money via google adsense for writing made up stories about trump and making them go viral on facebook in a single macedonian town veles there are at least 140 websites about american politics run by macedonian kids who make money from fabricated stories teenagers can earn up to 5 , 000 a month by making up things about trump they dont care about trump or clinton or anyone else theyve just worked out what the us public wants to read and have found a way of serving it up to them whether its true or not the best way of making money via google is to write clickbait , and the best clickbait theyve discovered , the stories that are spread widest and furthest in facebook and twitter , are stories about trump more specifically , false stories about trump because in 2016 we read the news we want to read the so called filter bubble , the means by which google and facebook give us more of what we want , or what we already know our searches and our newsfeeds are programmed to reflect our previous searches and newsfeeds is becoming not so much a bubble as a ghetto walled in , closed off , airless its not just that search engines have been shown to influence election results the higher up a candidates name is listed in any search , the more likely they are to win its also that the less we know about how other people think , the less we know were increasingly living in an echo chamber , exposed only to views which chime with our own the impression this gives is that everyone is like us , thinks like us , wants to be like us yet most people are not like us maybe thats what 2016 has come to teach us that and the idea that google and facebook are out to make the world a better place is both absurd and irrelevant it doesnt matter what mark zuckerberg wants or what sergey brin intends the people who donated to wikileaks didnt intend to get the first potential female us president investigated by the fbi nobody wanted their fridge to bring down cnn google didnt intend to drive all newspapers out of business its just something that is happening along the way and this time , its the big one the great disruption with trump the great disruptor will democracy survive \? will nato \? is a free and fair election possible in a post truth world when every word any candidate has ever written can be stolen and exposed and distorted \? who knows \? its a crapshoot from here on in go tell that to your filter bubble because thats all you can do no one else is listening topicstechnologythe observersergey brinjulian assangedonald trumptechcrunchairbnbfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
picture a child entering the world , around the time that a new social networking venture known as thefacebook com is making its own entrance to the world it is 2004 , and the child is easy to picture her parents have photographed their daughters first breath , first smile , first spoonfuls and first steps when she reaches school age , she is snapped in uniform , probably outside the front door , and one parent , probably her mother , shares the image with friends the child learns to read , write her name she wins certificates , excels at sport when twitter , instagram and later vine arrive , her public identities multiply she starts secondary school in a few months , this child and her classmates will begin to turn 13 and , perhaps , create their own facebook accounts when they do , they will come face to face with their digital shadow they may step into it easily , or try to sever themselves from it , but it wont let go , this pre existent media identity , because it has logged their lives from the moment they left the womb some will recognise their digital shadow , but what of those whose online identity bears little relation to their sense of self , or to the public identity they want to share \? for years , parents have fretted about their childrens posting activities , while continuing to post as they wish about their offspring is it time they stopped or at least asked for permission first \? do parents overshare pictures of their children on social media \? read moretoday these questions are on the minds of the children at kingsford community school in beckton , east london , where the 13 , 14 and 15 year old members of the debate mate after school club are filing into a classroom on the first floor , slinging down school bags and glancing at the motion on the whiteboard this house would ban parents from posting about their children on social media , the debate leader writes its kind of weird your parents are still posting pictures of you on social media , someone says one boy , malachi , bows his head and writes a single word on his notepad reputation this is really about consent , his friend says do i want to be seen by a larger , broader range of people \? there is a loud hum of agreement and one girl raises her voice parents ! we dont want them invading our privacy because some of us , the only privacy we get is through social media these pupils often discuss social networking sites , their attractions and perils , but this is the first time they have turned their scrutiny on their own parents and yet parents are the object of an increasingly aggressive interrogation this spring a mother from shropshire called out her sons bullying on facebook , only for the post to go viral the criticism of her became so intense she removed it and changed her facebook page and phone number next came the 20 year old mother from balloch , scotland , whose photographs of her 11 month old daughter in tiny high fashion outfits attracted an instagram following that included khlo kardashian until critics claimed the woman was sexualising her baby she has since locked the account and gone to ground after her came the arizona father who nakedly cradled his naked , feverish baby in the shower , an image his wife snapped and shared , before facebook removed it as offensive excessive sharing about your children has long incited disapproval , but recently the disapproval has begun to acquire a proto legal tinge in march , french police warned parents against posting photos of their children on social media according to social media analyst eric delcroix , the children could soon be able to sue them for posting inappropriate pictures , under the countrys privacy laws the treasurer of the uks human rights lawyers association , leanne targett parker , echoes the idea that it is only a matter of time before children mount legal challenges against oversharing parents you cant imagine it not being something that starts to develop within the next five to 10 years , she says i cant see how there be attempts at suing people for putting up posts that theyre unhappy with one day my hair was all raggedy , sticking up all over my auntie put iton facebook i was so embarrassed icriedsome parents may shrug off the shaming stories and the professionalised sharing of family vloggers such as the shaytards , the brataleys , the ballingers as beyond the range of their own moderate social media activity but listen to the children in the kingsford classroom and it becomes clear how many degrees there are of shame to these teenagers , even small instances of sharing can be divisive when i ask if anyone has experienced being overshared themselves , hands shoot up , but the answers are a long way from the public shaming that normally grabs headlines they are exactly the sort of infringements that many parents will commit without a second thought i was eating a subway chicken teriyaki eating that and my mum just took the picture and posted it on facebook , one pupil says when i was little my parents took a picture of me being potty trained three weeks ago they posted it on facebook me on the toilet it was really embarrassing , another adds i was with my aunt in the park i was wearing my scarf but i didnt have a pin it flew off and my hair was all raggedy , sticking up all over the place my auntie put it on facebook i was so embarrassed i was crying i asked her to take it down but she said , no , it looks cute my uncle posted when his daughter had diarrhoea pray for her one girl , 14 , raises her hand parents love to post things about you , personal information that you might not like , she says which kind of affects your relationship with them now , when you want to speak to them about certain things , youre worried they might post it her classmate erin stands up her team supports the motion on the whiteboard that parents should be banned from posting and they have an idea we want to pass a law that requires open forms of social media to put a consent button on their pages , so a child can report whether their parents have posted about them without consent , she declares if parents refuse to cooperate , they will be fined the amount of 1 , 000 these suggestions may sound excessive and unfeasible in fact they lie squarely within the recommendations made by a number of adults campaigning in this field erins idea of a penalty , for instance , echoes the attempts by a democratic state representative in illinois , la shawn k ford , to make the shaming of children on social networking sites an offence offending parents should face a penalty , he has argued , which , just like erins , would be a fine paid directly to the child as for the apparently far fetched idea of a consent button , this sounds uncannily similar to the delete button proposed by 5rights , the campaign steered by the peer and film maker beeban kidron to protect and empower children online more generally , the debaters irritation chimes with research published in march by a team at the university of michigan after interviewing 249 parent children pairings across 40 us states , the researchers found that children were more than twice as likely as parents to say that adults should not post information online about them without permission would the kingsford children concur \? class e11 rings with shouts of , yes ! it aint going to happen , their teacher , miss alimi , says miss ! one of her students cries theres a thing called wishful thinking miss alimi is right children are unlikely to gain control over their parents posting habits but there is still scope for a conversation about what constitutes fair sharing , and each family will draw its lines differently consider the case of heather whitten , the arizona based photographer and teaching assistant who took the photograph of her husband and son in the shower that facebook didnt like whitten saw the moment , and the image , as the height of parental care their toddler , fox , had had a temperature for hours her husband , thomas , was trying to cool the childs fever for two years , whitten kept the image private , finally posting it in may after facebook removed other pictures she had shared of her children she wanted to take a stand , to show that its just innocent pictures that people are twisting and getting offended by she was unprepared for the response for the way in which facebook removed images from her page every time it received sufficient complaints , for the level of disapproval the image provoked , including claims that it was sexual or inappropriate but whittens stand had one other unexpected consequence as the interested and the outraged followed the link to her blog , some began to question the legality , as well as the sense , of showing children naked i just thought you were free to post what you wanted on the internet , whitten says now but then she discovered that in the state of arizona , you cant show any naked images of childrens pelvic area or butt , and i realised i was technically breaking a law she removed the blog took everything down but in the bigger , moral sense , i dont feel ive done anything wrong im not exploiting my children im not abusing my children im just sharing our lives exactly how they are she saw how many pictures there were of her and she didnt like it now any time you see lily , it is with her permissionwhittens experience shows just how nebulous and fraught the territory of sharing can be sure , her experience would never befall those for whom posting naked images of children is strictly out of bounds but the case of whitten is complicated she and her partner are raising their children to not be ashamed or embarrassed of their bodies they are living online within the offline boundaries they have set for themselves people dont show nudity a lot of times because they think it will have a negative impact on their child your footprint is for ever on the internet , whitten says for me , its absurd i just hope to combat that a little who knows how it will actually turn out , but i hope that my children wont ever look back and see pictures of themselves as children and feel embarrassed by other people seeing them as well because there is nothing to be embarrassed about fox , the toddler in the shower , is still too young to veto or cherish the photograph that caused such controversy , but his older sister lily , nine , loves it , according to her mother she couldnt really wrap her head around why people would think there was anything wrong with it and yet , while lily was comfortable with the image of her baby brother , she was deeply unhappy with other photographs her mother had uploaded the apparently harmless kind that many parents post one day at around the age of six , lily began to scroll through her mothers instagram she saw how many pictures there were of her and she didnt like it , whitten says for months , whenever lily saw whitten with the camera , she hid that really opened up a conversation about why i take pictures , why i share pictures , who i share pictures with now , whitten says , any time you see lily , it is with her permission alicia blum ross , a researcher at the london school of economics , believes we are entering a crucial moment we are starting to see kids who have grown up , whose parents have shared images , and who are beginning to say wait a minute im not sure im comfortable with that what families need , she thinks , is a coming of age conversation after all , it was lily whitten herself , at six , who instigated the dialogue with her mother that earned her the right to veto content does lily have advice for other children \? they should say , please dont take any pictures of me it makes me uncomfortable , she says and i might change my mind one day , but today i dont want to have to hide from your camera soon this digital rulebook chat might become as standard as the one about the birds and the bees blum ross sees nothing to fear both parties , she points out , are united by being the first generation of parents and children to negotiate this path it can be a really shared experience , she says enthusiastically the dilemmas are shared dilemmas , the pleasures are shared pleasures its a moment of overlap blum ross , who has three year old twins , says she is not a person who advises total protection i certainly wouldnt say , dont share things about your children online its important that parents are able to claim their own space about that its ok to say , i need this community whitten , too , has always seen her sharing in those terms i feel i share everything as my story this is my perspective on my life as a mother with these children im not trying to put words in their mouth , or tell the story from their perspective it is one of the oldest questions of storytelling who does the story belong to \? blum ross , whitten and countless others believe they are telling their own stories , and sharing posts about their children where they fit that perspective but its complicated i never had a filter before , says whitten , sounding forlorn i love the idea of having connections with other mothers and people but i cant share the way i used to after the facebook furore , she is still fathoming whether to photograph differently or simply stop sharing photograph getty imagesfor other parents , such as the author amy webb , who has written about her commitment to post nothing about her daughter online , the same process of consideration deters them from sharing altogether they have the big conversation with themselves , each other , sometimes their children and decide the best answer is silence when the guardian asked readers about their experiences , apricot , who is 30 and lives in the north of england , wrote when i started to facebook my own childs pictures , i began to feel intensely uncomfortable how could i instil in her a principle of privacy when i had essentially devalued hers from the beginning \? she stopped posting what we post is facets of ourselves , said tamasine preece , a teacher in bridgend , whose phd includes a chapter on oversharing i think there is a morality to using children to explore parts of ourselves my children are not me they are separate kidron , who says she has never interacted with her children on social networking sites \( they are now 19 and 21 \) , thinks that her behaviour reflects the idea that oversharing is inappropriate when the whole point of the journey to adulthood is to self define to work out who you are , what your values are , how youre going to fit in i think we have not thought hard enough about what that process might be like , if so much is shared and so much is public there are three issues here , she says one is the right to a certain sort of privacy the second is the need of young people to transgress and bump into their edges , and for that to be somewhat safe the third is the need to break away from the model of your parents my own facebook posts dried up as i researched this article of course , i can ask my children for consent , but i am not sure they are ready for a responsibility with permanent consequences if an eight year old consents to a post , is it fair to act upon that consent , or should a parent second guess how those feelings might evolve \? after all , posts are eternal and a child cannot speak for his or her future self in any case , a childs consent can be capricious , even within one given day my daughter , at eight , would prefer her photo not to appear on facebook , but would be more than happy to see a video of herself playing swingball on youtube my six year old , meanwhile , says he is sad that google doesnt know me even the teenagers at kingsford are conflicted in the end , they vote against erins suggestion of a fine for parents who share without their childrens consent , but they squirm in their seats , clawing the air for a turn to speak when i ask what rules they would lay down for their parents dont say embarrassing jokes cos thats too much as far as the world is concerned , were not related post pictures of me when i look amazing dont post baby pictures unless im happy and fully clothed dont ever comment on my pictures dont stalk my profile waiting for me to load pictures dont follow dont add me or my friends dont tell dad jokes dont take pictures of me eating food , cos my friends take it out of context dont try and use internet slang on our wall on your friends profiles you can embarrass yourselves all you want , but when its on our profiles it looks like weve taught you to say that and it makes us look really bad stay behind the times of course , every family is different in a quiet cul de sac in newton abbot , devon , with sunlight pouring into the lounge , molly povey and her 11 year old son roman are sitting on the sofa discussing their experience of going viral in april 2015 , with roman desperately unhappy at school , molly posted a plea on her facebook page for his classmates parents to send her beautiful son birthday cards roman doesnt have any friends and often cries himself to sleep , the post began it was shared around the world maybe 40 , 000 times , molly says \( interestingly , her post breaks only the second of the kingsford rules , by disclosing that molly and roman are related \) neither molly nor roman , nor his two brothers , nor his dad ian , who says he hates social media , were prepared for what happened next thousands of people left birthday greetings online at the office of a friend whose address was hastily borrowed to protect romans privacy cards and gifts began to arrive molly formalised the chaos into a cards for roman facebook page friendships were made , and some of them have lasted to the extent that in april , a year after his mothers plea for help , roman celebrated his 12th birthday with 150 friends , strangers and facebook friends at a nandos in exeter and at a second party in london they have even met up with well wishers in germany facebook twitter pinterest molly povey , whose post about her sons loneliness went viral , with some of the birthday cards he was sent by strangers all over the world photograph rebecca rees for the guardianwhile molly tells this story , talking quickly because there is a lot to fit in , roman scurries to and fro with his gifts a star wars chess set from someone in the netherlands , pictures from brazilian schoolchildren \( molly says he is very big in brazil \) , wicker baskets of cards but sometimes molly worries a bit i think , what happens in years to come if he googles himself and finds lonely boy with no friends \? last year the local paper ran a front page headline saying just that i thought , oh my god , what have i done \? roman was with her , and comforted her but it is true , he said i am really lonely for the povey family , the benefits of mollys post are visible each day his tearfulness has declined the whole household is happier molly herself has found , in the facebook page , a community that makes her feel supported and which , in turn , needs her and now youve got a responsibility , ian says its a strange thing he himself has never read the initial post , usually declines to appear in photographs , and thinks that when it comes to sharing , its best to err on the side of caution occasionally , molly tells her community that roman is having a bad day , or that she is she doesnt want to pretend to people who know loneliness that loneliness doesnt happen and yet , as ian says , its difficult to know sometimes what roman really thinks about it molly leads the way up to romans bedroom , to show more of the gifts people sent there is james bond notepaper from the actor andrew scott , who played the baddie in spectre , and a crew t shirt from star wars episode iii i wonder if roman minds thousands of strangers knowing hes sad do you mind \? molly asks him do you mind that people know you get really lonely \? maybe , roman replies i dont know ill go yes i dont like it you dont like it \? molly repeats , incredulous no what , that people around the world know you are lonely \? yeah you dont like it now \? she asks again no oh , molly says she sounds deflated it just feels weird , it does , roman tells her although molly has publicly revealed aspects of her sons emotional life that other parents might hesitate to share , she is not incautious for months she withheld romans full name and has only recently felt comfortable disclosing that he is autistic before her heartfelt post , she deleted baby pictures of romans older brother because he was about to start secondary school surely the kingsford debaters would approve like alicia blum ross and heather whitten , molly has rules think about whether its appropriate if in a year or five years your child would be embarrassed by anything youve done and just why are you actually doing it \? is it a positive thing , or is it to give you a social boost as opposed to the children \? molly might appear to be at the opposite end of the spectrum from tamasine preece , who never posts , but the morals that underpin their behaviour are remarkably alike and while molly thinks you shouldnt be posting pictures of kids in the bath , in some ways her posts are as exposing as whittens later that evening molly emails to say that the conversation with roman had troubled her after id left the house , she offered to take down the page , she says , but roman said not to turns out he was confused in his room and was talking about not liking being lonely , and not his page or maybe roman , in that moment , wished no one knew he was lonely then , later , when his mother checked , he minded less or maybe he understands that the community his mother has created has benefited him and his family but these are only guesses it is impossible to know he is young , and the world changes many times a day his parents have his best interests at heart , but like any who share news of their children , every time they post , they cross a line between privacy and publicity where each parent sees the line is an unsteady , unsettleable question for roman , and others like him , the truth may be something they are still working out , or simply prefer not to share ive gone online after a few glasses of wine and said things i shouldnt have parents and children talk social media facebook twitter pinterest her posts can be really personal sadie star with her mum , elaine photograph jonathan browning for the guardianelaine star , 47 , a pa and poet , and her youngest daughter sadie , 17 , a student , live in brighton elaine ive had a facebook account for about 10 years , so sadie was probably seven when i first joined i use it to keep in touch with different groups of people old friends , my poetry group , the puppet show i work with im also friends with a lot of my kids friends , because its often the best way of locating where mine are i dont think it bothers them all their friends are happy to come to the house and sit around my kitchen table and chat , so i dont think its odd i dont post on their friends pages maybe just a happy birthday message but im really impressed by the sorts of things they share about science , politics theyre very funny and insightful i have definitely made mistakes online ive gone on after a few glasses of wine and said things i shouldnt have there have been some angry messages about the state my kids and their friends have left the house in and they have all asked me to take down various photos i get it im sensitive to the fact that theyre trying to be cool or whatever i think im past the stage of worrying too much about embarrassing my kids i write poems that are very personal , and i share them on facebook but thats how i express myself the kids have occasionally said , stop living your life on facebook but im an open person theyre all fairly streetwise we have a very open dialogue in our house they have occasionally posted things that i think are a bit questionable showing off a bit about drinking with their friends , that sort of thing i might have said , hmm , you might want to think about that but ive never said , take that down im glad facebook wasnt around to record my teenage years , though id hate it sadie my siblings and i all use facebook in different ways stevie posts a lot of pictures maisie likes to talk about stuff me and joe post a lot of news stories , and i like posting videos or songs i dont like to put up personal pictures , or get too emotional on facebook my mums posts can be really personal at the beginning , i didnt really want to be friends with her on facebook i didnt really want her seeing pictures of me that my friends had posted they werent anything bad they just felt like a bit of my life that was separate from her now i dont mind as much im more open shes also friends with a lot of my friends on there thats not a problem , except that shes quite free with what she writes something would happen between us , and shed put it in a poem , and post it to facebook , and i wondered whether my friends would see her in a different way i think maybe i felt protective of her but no one has ever said anything she has a lot of photos of us when we were little when i was a bit younger , i hated seeing some of them online i remember there was one where i was holding my pet hamster and i just thought i looked greasy and rough and once my room was really messy and my mum said , ill take pictures and put it on facebook i would have hated it if shed actually done it now im a bit older , ive learned to let go of it all a bit more i think im ok with whats out there about me facebook twitter pinterest i dont feel like the same person i was when i was little nell redelsperger talbotwith her mother , juliet photograph lewis khan for the guardianjuliet redelsperger talbot , 43 , a marketing and events manager , and nell , 13 , live in eye , suffolk , with nells father and her brother lawrence , 10 nell ive been cyberbullied before one of my followers on instagram , someone i knew , turned on me , then a couple of others who id thought were friendly were making comments on my posts it wasnt nice , and i wasnt sure how to handle it in school they give you lessons about what to do if it happens to you , but when it comes to it , the reality is very different but the school did deal with it after that , i became a lot more careful about who i accept as friends , and what people can see now i have one account for my photography and a separate one for my closest friends i have looked briefly at mums facebook account , but i dont have a clue about how facebook works i dont think i mind that there are photos of me if you know the people that can see those photos , then thats ok if its not private , im not so sure about that but i dont find it embarrassing maybe its because i dont feel like the same person i was when i was little it doesnt feel as if those pictures are of me juliet the cyberbullying was a harrowing time for nell , but what was good was that some of her friends were supportive and took screenshots of the comments as proof of what was happening nell was worried i would be angry , so she didnt come to me until after it was over it was awful , but in a way , i think it helped her understand what youre exposed to online nell is a great photographer , and she sends me pictures , but i check that she is happy before i post anything on facebook your children have every right to veto what you put online , although they have to be a certain age before they understand what it means neither of mine have ever had an issue with something ive posted , but then theyre the generation that are used to having photos of themselves everywhere i think it meant something different for my generation it took so long to get photos developed that seeing yourself was so much more important the children were very little when i first signed up i dont remember thinking much about privacy then it wasnt until i read in the paper how posts about your children might be seen by complete strangers that i changed my settings as time went by , i began to feel uncomfortable about posting it felt like everything online was becoming more about look how wonderful i am and it made me feel quite down so i left for a while

how do i become an agony aunt \? ive tried using social media but it hasnt workedas you are something of an agony uncle , i am seeking your advice on how to become an agony aunt all my life i have helped others with their problems i have tried hard to find out how i can do this publicly i have started my own facebook and twitter pages , but have been unsuccessful so far any tips or advice you could offer would be gratefully received jeremy saysid like to know in what way your facebook and twitter pages have been unsuccessful theres nearly always something constructive to be learned from failure but you have more than failure to guide you you say that all your life you have helped others with their problems , so you must have some fairly clear ideas about the kind of advice that has been most useful adapting this experience to your online presence makes obvious sense , but i imagine youve done this already as for the advice itself , a surprising number of peoples problems stem from their failure to see things through the eyes of others they are genuinely baffled , and often upset , because a friend , partner , boss or colleague doesnt see things in the same way empathy comes naturally to some , but others have to work at it however , it can solve or ease a great many differences of opinion as a solver of other peoples problems yourself , some degree of empathy is probably your most valuable talent readers say as someone who has worked in a counselling type role my whole life , i would say , dont in my experience the people who would actually be the best at this type of thing dont do it , for a host of rational reasons , or cant do it , because theyre not journalists or famous journalism is probably the more reliable route , because becoming famous is more by happenstance than design being a professional counsellor , psychologist , or psychotherapist etc may help you see the issues better , but you simply wont have enough information to provide anything truly helpful momenta consider volunteering with an organisation such as the samaritans , which provides training and support it responds to people who are struggling , lonely , ill , poor , in jail or at school anyone who wants to talk being an agony aunt is a niche role and one that is often as much \( if not more \) about the adviser than the person asking for help id ask why its that route in particular that appeals pumpkindoge it is about having an appropriate background in publishing , a reputation for having a clear thinking , balanced approach to issues , and a substantial amount of luck starterforten train to be a counsellor or , better , a psychotherapist itll take years and money but , most of all , you will be forced to question whether what you do is of any help onalongsabbatical write to yourself for advice if its good advice you will reach your goal if its bad advice , maybe choose another path iamtherobotmanhow can i help my daughter to choose a career after she finishes sitting her a levels \? my daughter is bright but doesnt know what degree to take as she has no clear career plan we have discussed this time and again , but she still cant decide she is studying for a levels in biology , history and psychology , and completed as levels in english and law she enjoys writing and has considered journalism , but she is particularly interested in endangered species and greenpeace any ideas on how , as her mum , i can gently and diplomatically try and set her on an interesting path \? jeremy saysyour concern for her future is understandable and laudable you just have to be heroically patient its not unusual for those of your daughters age and stage of education to be indecisive about what to do next as the sense of pressure mounts , often compounded by would be helpful teachers and parents , wrong decisions can be made perhaps the most useful discussion should start with the sort of career she might consider there are some for which a degree in mathematics , for example , is essential but from the sound of it her interests mean the precise choice of degree course is less crucial her interests in journalism , the environment and greenpeace suggest there is no essential degree subject the a levels she is taking are usefully broad , and will provide her with valuable qualifications without being restrictive by all means continue to discuss her emerging interests , but only if she welcomes such discussions if she shows curiosity about an occupation , consider buying her books on the subject , but take care she knows they are not intended as a covert form of encouragement even if she appeals to you to tell her what you think she should do , resist its important she senses what she wants to do with her life and she will the urgency to do so is not quite as great as it seems readers say her college library should have a wide range of resources on choosing a degree course and careers information she could also take a look at websites such as prospects ac uk , which suggests career paths and gives job profiles her mix of a levels could take her in different directions id5279121 she sounds like the ideal candidate for a gap year not a jaunt to thailand or botswana , but time out to try out a fewdifferent jobs , possibly to join greenpeace and see what grabs her inpractice for most people the day to day realities of a job affect our enjoyment far more than the title or industry how much will you need to interact with the public \? how do you feel about eight hours a day in front of a computer \? how much does money or status matter \? these are best learned in practice , and she can use her experiences to guide her choice id0191535 the pace of technological change is so rapid , and the global environment so unstable , that its hard to begin to imagine what work will look like even in 10 years time your daughter should choose a course that she finds interesting and which suits her abilities regordane what would she like to spend three years studying in depth \? worry about the job in three years time life will probably look and feel a lot different to her then your main role should be subtly guiding her away from decisions of the but media studies sounds really interesting , and so what if the university comes bottom of all the charts , and anyway thats where jack is going and i love him ! variety calleydo you need advice on a work issue \?

there are only days to go before the us presidential election on 8 november what are the latest polls saying \? for an election that is generating more passion on both sides than any in recent memory , pollsters and pundits are offering scant comfort to those seeking clarity about tuesdays result most outlets continue to predict victory for hillary clinton , but various models differ greatly in the certainty they award that outcome , and various polling averages disagree on the margin nate silvers fivethirtyeight model gives clinton a 65 chance of winning to donald trumps 35 , while the new york times sticks its neck out with an 86 chance of a clinton presidency to 14 for trump realclearpolitics polling average has clinton ahead by 1 7 percentage points , while huffpost pollsters average gives her a 5 5 percentage point lead how have these indicators changed since james comey announced the fbi was looking into clintons emails again \? amid this dense electoral fog , what is clear is that comeys bombshell last friday that the fbi is in a sense reviving its probe into clintons use of a private email server when she was us secretary of state has had a profound impact on the race it allowed trump , until then mired in his own controversy over his attitudes towards women , to swing the spotlight back onto his rivals perceived untrustworthiness probably as a result , the republican nominees plummeting poll ratings have rallied , bringing them within the margin of error both on a national measure and in key states such as florida , and even propelling him into the lead in the bellwether state of ohio whats happening now about the fbi investigation \? is there a timeframe \? fbi agents are racing through 650 , 000 emails reported to have been found on a laptop shared between huma abedin , vice chair of clintons campaign , and her estranged husband anthony weiner \( he of the sexting scandals \) it is not known how many of those emails came to or from abedin , nor how many might have related to clinton or might already have been examined by the bureau if there are any new clinton emails , it will take time to work out whether they contain classified material so the search is unlikely to be completed by tuesday , leaving this sword of damocles dangling over the democratic presidential candidate as americans go to the polls how is early voting looking \? more than 34 million americans have already voted , surpassing the 32 million who cast their ballots early four years ago will this benefit clinton or trump \? theres no easy answer to that question , given variations both by state and electoral group but there are clues the good news for clinton is that latino turnout among early voters has increased dramatically over 2012 , suggesting that the sleeping giant of the hispanic vote might actually have been awoken this year by trumps anti immigrant rhetoric the bad news is that the african american turnout , such a vital element in the coalition built by barack obama in his two successful presidential runs , is relatively sluggish this time as is turnout for young voters the fall in black turnout could be especially perilous for clinton in swing states such as north carolina , which has been identified by both candidates as a key target can early voters change their minds , as trump has urged , and have they been \? trump is trying to use the furor over the fbis renewed interest in clintons emails to persuade those early voters feeling buyers remorse to switch their preference now that you see that hillary was a big mistake , change your vote , he said on twitter , making the same appeal at a campaign stop this week in wisconsin , one of six states that do actually allow early voters to change their minds \( three times , in wisconsins case \) the others are connecticut , michigan , minnesota , mississippi , new york and pennsylvania some early voters have made use of this facility , though probably not in numbers large enough to make a difference whats the latest from florida , and why is the sunshine state so crucial \? florida accounts for 29 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win , which puts it on a par with new york and means it has fewer than only california and texas combine that with the states history of squeakily close presidential elections obama won here in 2012 by just 74 , 000 out of more than 8m votes and you have the mother of all swing states all modeling suggests trump must win florida or kiss goodbye to the white house , although for clinton it may not be quite so crucial true to form , the race in florida is looking too close to call clinton is counting on a large turnout of democratic leaning puerto ricans in central florida , while trump is bashing the theme of the fbis investigation into clintons emails in the hope of riling floridians into backing him facebook twitter pinterest how does the us electoral college work \? how are voters reacting to trumps holding back of his tax returns \? trump is the first presidential nominee of either main party since watergate in 1972 to withhold his or her tax returns his only return to have been made public , courtesy of a new york times leak , suggests he may have avoided paying federal income tax for two decades his reluctance is deeply unpopular , with polls showing that voters overwhelmingly think he should publish the records , as do two thirds of republican voters and almost half of trumps own supporters but whether that translates into actual votes remains a moot point what about trumps other difficulty , with female voters \? it seems that trumps crude comments captured on a hot mic about making uninvited sexual advances to women might not have dissuaded many staunch conservative women voters from supporters him but it has hurt him among white women voters generally who will play an important role in determining the outcome of the election ten recent polls show clinton with an historically high 17 point advantage among women voters what last minute plans are there for this weekend \?

in a workshop in west virginias appalachian mountains there is an unlikely source of common ground for donald trump and hillary clinton from this humble setting , high end cabinets are crafted for the luxury market by the employees of christopher peacock , a briton who moved to the us in 1987 the eponymous carpentry firm has supplied cabinets for 13 rooms of the clintons private residence in chappaqua , new york state , while the company has also worked with trump on a penthouse project in new york city the clintons were very engaged in the process and enjoyed it tremendously the experience with trump was not quite the same , says peacock diplomatically following the brexit vote , the british government will be keen to grease the wheels for a bilateral trade deal with whoever wins the us presidency on 8 november the department for international trade has already revealed plans to open three new trade offices in the us for those seeking to take advantage of its opportunities britain and the us already have one of the strongest trade and investment relationships in the world estimated to be worth more than 1tn every year while any bilateral trade agreement between the us and uk could be politically charged if it resembles the controversial transatlantic trade and investment partnership \( ttip \) , proponents of the scheme claimed it would provide a boost to small business in particular by loosening regulations a ttip agreement between the us and the eu , on the other hand , may now never see the light of day due to concerns over provisions such as the investor state dispute settlement , which would allow companies to sue foreign governments for compensation claiming unfair treatment if they lose a government contract eu and us trade negotiators seek to get ttip talks back on track read morejeffries briginshaw , chief executive at britishamerican business , expects to see an increase in trade between the uk and us if a new and imaginative bilateral economic agreement is struck with the majority of smes in both countries not currently trading internationally , this is a huge untapped market providing massive scope to strengthen and deepen trade ties , says briginshaw the uk and us enjoy a strong trading relationship however , there are still many barriers to trade that affect smes disproportionately when compared to larger companies briginshaw argues that removing these prohibitive barriers would greatly assist smes looking to expand overseas on the whole , peacock has found us local government to be amenable to doing whatever it can to make his business succeed west virginia itself has its own small business department in order to foster entrepreneurialism in the state he says the state has been proactive in making his business a success ever since he approached it in the 1990s for funding to take over the appalachian wood making facility that was threatened with closure for us the conversation flows freely throughout between each department and they are small enough to be approachable and not get stuck in the mud with bureaucracy , says peacock the states are pretty autonomous in terms of being able to do their own trade without federal approval , says earl ray tomblin , governor of west virginia , who was recently in the uk on a trade delegation we as a state can do business with basically any country that is not at war with the united states tomblin foresees that trade between local us businesses and the uk would continue post brexit , but that multinationals might be affected we have a lot of small businesses in west virginia that export to the uk and i think those relationships will probably not see any long term effect from brexit they will still be trading , buying and selling maybe with some multinationals who are shipping through the uk to the continent there may be some different relationships there but i can see where leaving the single market will be a detriment to the uk simply because there are going to be certain tariffs that raise the price on british products , he adds brexit trade deals the gruelling challenge of taking back control read morerobin bingeman is managing director at uk based email archiving firm cryoserver , which exports servers around the world and derives a fifth of its turnover from north america he suspects there will still be opportunities to trade with the us , regardless of the time it takes to hash out a trade deal america is a good neighbour of ours and they do like british technology , he says i think from the way we are trading with north american organisations \( mainly it departments \) , they probably dont really care about regulations or trade agreements they are just interested in meeting a clients requirement bingeman has not experienced repercussions from us partners after the british referendum but says he has noticed a difference with european firms i feel that orders i may have expected to receive might have been delayed because there is some uncertainty i have found this with a number of different territories throughout europe peacock says he is excited by brexit and believes it could ultimately be beneficial for the uk i think it is going to be tough and painful for a while , he adds there will be a natural shake up of things which may be daunting for everybody because it is the unknown , but change is good and small firms can metamorphose into what we need to be to take advantage of the moment for those with the wherewithal , briginshaw says , the opportunities are there our trading relationship will largely depend on the shape and scope of a future trade deal and the latent ambition of uk entrepreneurs , he says those uk entrepreneurs that untap their potential could find themselves emulating peacock by counting the future president of the us among their clients sign up to become a member of the guardian small business network here for more advice , insight and

voice plans now allow for unlimited talk , but my brief answer has never changed hes the best person i have ever met closing out her address in raleigh , north carolina , democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said that the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the hatred and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in history i believe americas best days are still ahead of us if we do what were supposed to do , clinton concluded every social movement , every economic advance , has only come about because people going to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the affect of adversity it wasnt easy to get the vote for women it wasnt easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the civil rights act was enforced it wasnt easy , because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down , clinton continued it is now our turn , our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back ! we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise , clinton urged the crowd you can make the difference not only in who you elect , but in the agenda that those people then get to work i want you to hold me accountable i want you to be my partners everything ive done started by listening to people listening to hear your stories

! we are not going to allow trump or anyone to divide us up ! vermont senator bernie sanders lauded hillary clintons stance on the environment , and drew contrasts with , well , differences with donald trumps platform there is one difference that is very , very profound , sanders said secretary clinton believes in science and i know , i know i put her in a difficult position in 2016 , to believe in science is a little bit dangerous , but what the heck the debate is over climate change is real , climate change is caused by human activity , and climate change is already , today , causing devastating problems in this country and around the world trump , meanwhile , has concluded that climate change is a hoax emanating from china now , why he chose china and not mexico or some muslim country , i dont know , but thats the way it is this is not a funny issue ive got seven grandchildren , sanders continued our job as custodians of this planet is to make sure that we leave our children and grandchildren a planet that is healthy and habitable and that means that we have to have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry and tell them that their short term profits are not

pyotr aven aven worked with vladimir putin in city government in st petersburg in the early 1990s the slate story , quoting a range of cybersecurity experts , said the communication between the servers suggested it was human rather than robotic , and that it was intended to be secret and exclusive in a statement , fireeye said it had been presented with a log of the communication between the servers over a period of 90 days , listing the separate contacts the information presented is inconclusive and is not evidence of substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between alfa bank and the trump campaign or organization , the statement said the list presented does not contain enough information to show that there has been any actual activity opposed to simple dns lookups , which can come from a variety of sources including anti spam and other security software the statement continued as part of the ongoing investigation , alfa bank has opened its it systems to mandiant , which has investigated both remotely and on the ground in moscow we are continuing our investigation nothing we have or have found alters our view as described above that there isnt evidence of substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between alfa bank and the trump campaign or organization cybersecurity firm fails to find links between donald trump and russian bank read more

bush told the associated press potentially but hard to speculate from donald trumps press pool donald trump finished his speech at 6 54 cdt , pausing near the end as his audience erupted in a chant of president trump ! president trump ! pool left at 6 59 in the van , joining mr trumps motorcade for a ride to the airport and a 3 hour flight to miami , fl tonights speech was steady , and lacking in the off the cuff departures that tend to characterize his rallies in your poolers humble opinion , trump has not stayed this on message in any other public rally since the republican national convention your pooler would bet an expensive lunch that he diverted very little from his prepared remarks wisconsin senator ron johnson , who is expected to cruise to reelection victory in next weeks election despite fellow republican donald trumps underwater polling numbers in the state , told the beloit daily news that hillary clintons use of private email servers are impeachable offenses she purposefully circumvented the law , this was willful concealment and destruction , johnson said im not a lawyer , but this is clearly written i would say yes , high crime or misdemeanor , i believe she is in violation of both laws johnson referred to two laws regarding the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to the national defense , the punishment for which includes fines and the forfeiture of holding elected office johnson dismissed the conclusion by the fbi that clinton did not break the law that was a corrupt conclusion , johnson said every election is a binary choice , but she has disqualified herself , johnson said of clinton i would love to be voting for ronald reagan , and im sure the democrats would rather be voting for harry truman , but the reality is that is not our choice hundreds of the worlds most respected economists , including eight nobel laureates , have signed and published a letter urging us voters not to support republican presidential nominee donald trump , calling trump a dangerous , destructive choice who would doom the country to recession , or worse donald trump is a dangerous , destructive choice for the country , the letter asserts , after listing off more than a dozen reasons for voters to support a different candidate he misinforms the electorate , degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories , and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality if elected , he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions , and to the prosperity of the country for these reasons , we strongly recommend that you do not vote for donald trump the letters 370 signatories , which include oliver hart of harvard university , one of the two nobel winners in economics this year , and paul romer , the chief economist at the world bank , accuse trump of , in order degrading trust in vital public institutions that collect and disseminate information about the economy , including the bureau of labor statistics misleading voters by asserting that the renegotiation of nafta or the imposition of tariffs on china would substantially increase employment in manufacturing trump has diverted the policy discussion to options that ignore both the reality of technological progress and the benefits of international trade he has misled the public by asserting that us manufacturing has declined falsely suggesting that the toughness of negotiators primarily drives trade deficits misleading american voters with false statements about trade agreements eroding national income and wealth lowering the seriousness of public discussions of the national debt and deficits by suggesting that eliminating the environmental protection agency or the department of education would significantly reduce the fiscal deficit he claims he will eliminate the fiscal deficit , but has proposed a plan that would decrease tax revenue by 2 6 to 5 9 trillion over the next decade according to the non partisan tax foundation proposing a reduction in public saving that is likely to increase the us trade deficit using immigration as a red herring to mislead voters about issues of economic importance misleading the electorate by declaring that the us is one of the most heavily taxed countries his statements reveal a deep ignorance of economics and an inability to listen to credible experts , the letters signatories conclude he repeats fake and misleading economic statistics , and pushes fallacies about the vat and trade competitiveness he promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options polls are often conducted over multiple days , so were only just starting to measure the effect of the fbis decision to release new details of its investigation into hillary clintons private email server to lawmakers on friday according to the abc washington post tracking poll published on tuesday \( conducted october 27 30 \) , the democratic candidate has now slipped behind donald trump , on 45 to her republican opponents 46 the polling average calculated by realclearpolitics , a much better indication of national sentiment , shows clinton is now leading by just 2 percentage points , down from 5 percentage points a week ago those numbers are interesting but not necessarily indicative polling wont neatly translate to votes far more important will be the turnout especially since the two leading presidential candidates are so close in terms of unpopularity and the candidates know it a senior adviser to donald trump reportedly revealed last week that we have three major voter suppression operations under way intended to reduce votes for clinton among african americans , white liberals and young women even though election day is still a week away , we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups because more than 25m ballots have already been cast under the us early voting system approximately 125 million to 145 million americans are predicted to vote in the 2016 election , so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected total higher turnout than at this time in 2012of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots , north carolina , california and nine other states report more early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election ohio , nevada , colorado and iowa showed a decline in early voting , and those declines were small early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young votersthe early results offer mixed news for clinton early votes suggest that young voters who are much more likely than older voters to lean democratic might be staying at home in 12 states , fewer americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012 this could be especially problematic for clinton if this group is indicative of a broader bernie or bust sentiment in which supporters of the former democratic candidate bernie sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for clinton young voters arent the only demographic group that appears put off early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states especially in north carolina , a state that yields 15 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests clinton is in a close contest if trumps strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote , that makes a lot of sense those voters could be crucial for clinton to secure the white house election polls tighten but turnout is the real key to clinton v trump read more speaking in eau claire , wisconsin , donald trump predicted an unprecedented constitutional crisis if hillary clinton were to be elected president the work of government would come to an unbelievably unglorious halt , trump said , and she is likely to be investigated for years , likely to be concluded with a very large scale criminal trial the audience chanted lock her up ! in response this is a message for any democratic voter who have already cast their ballot for hillary clinton and have a severe case of buyers remorse , trump said , referring to a few states wisconsin included where early ballots can be reversed before election day a lot of stuff has come out since youve voted you can change your vote to donald trump well make america great again , okay \? she will never make america great speaking in eau claire , wisconsin , republican presidential nominee donald trump greeted the audience by declaring that in one week , we are going to win the great state of wisconsin lauding the states governor , scott walker , as one tough cookie , trump moved swiftly past local flavor for a casual listing of polls \( valid or otherwise \) that show him surging in battleground states were on the cusp of something incredible historic change that transfers power from a failed political establishment , trump said watch it live here
whats the problem with hillary clintons emails \? clinton used a private email server , situated in her new york home , while she was secretary of state , from 2009 to 2013 she has admitted that this was a mistake in july , the fbi concluded that clinton and her aides had been extremely careless in their handling of classified information but should not face criminal charges the issue has dogged the democrats campaign for the presidency , with supporters of republican rival donald trump regularly chanting lock her up ! clinton emails fbi gets warrant as comey told he may have broken law read morewhat just happened \? on friday , fbi director james comey alerted members of congress to the existence of a new batch of emails he said could be pertinent to the investigation as many as 650 , 000 messages were reportedly found on a laptop seized during an unrelated investigation of anthony weiner , a former new york congressman who is the estranged husband of longtime clinton aide huma abedin abedin and weiner separated after weiner was caught in 2011 , 2013 and again in 2016 sending women sexually explicit text messages and pictures of himself undressed federal authorities in new york and north carolina are investigating online communications between weiner and a 15 year old girl senior officials at the department of justice expressed concern that comeys decision to inform congress would be inconsistent with protocols designed to avoid the appearance of interference in an election but the fbi director went ahead what is in the emails \? we dont know comey himself admitted the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant those mails with a connection to clintons server could merely be duplicates of emails already analysed or they could contain a smoking gun that compromises clinton even after the election on sunday , the fbi obtained a warrant to begin reviewing the newly discovered emails the process will not be finished before election day what was the reaction to comeys announcement \? the timing , less than two weeks before a presidential election , drew harsh criticism from democrats and even some republicans at an organising event in daytona beach , clinton called comeys actions unprecedented and deeply troubling her campaign launched an all out war on comey chairman john podesta said by providing selective information , hes allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because comey has not been forthcoming with the facts the wider democratic establishment also weighed in four senators demanded a briefing from comey and nearly 100 former department of justice officials and prosecutors , both republican and democratic and led by the former obama attorney general eric holder , signed a letter criticising comeys decision the trump campaign , meanwhile , was elated we never thought we were going to say thank you to anthony weiner , the republican presidential nominee told a rally in nevada did comey abuse his power \? the nearly 100 former officials criticised his actions in their open letter , which was released by the clinton campaign director comeys letter is inconsistent with prevailing department policy , and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections , they said in another scathing letter to comey , the democratic senate minority leader , harry reid of nevada , accused him of clear intent to aid one party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act , which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election , reid wrote through your partisan actions , you may have broken the law richard painter , chief white house ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 , said he had filed a complaint against the fbi for a possible violation of the hatch act what is the hatch act \? passed in 1939 , it forbids anyone in the executive branch \( apart from the president or vice president \) from using his or her official position to engage in political activity carolyn lerner , head of the us office of special counsel , wrote in the new york times five years ago at its best , the act prevents people in political power from abusing their positions it prohibits coercion by a government supervisor such as pressuring employees to volunteer for or contribute to a campaign and shields the civil service and the federal workplace from politicking in july , the housing secretary , julian castro , was found to have violated the hatch act when he expressed support for clinton comeys action , however , is less blatantly partisan and a case against him would be tough to prove in court the republican congressman trey gowdy told fox news on monday it is laughable that jim comey committed a violation of the hatch act i actually know what the hatch act is demonstrating a selective reading of the act , he continued if the president of the united states actively campaigning on company time for another candidate to be president of the united states is not a violation of the hatch act , then how is jim comey supplementing the record and telling the truth to congress a violation of the hatch act \? harry reid knows that this is not a violation so why did comey do it \? will hillary clinton lose the us election because of the fbi email investigation \? read morehe told fbi colleagues in a memo on friday he was aware his letter was at risk of being misunderstood , but felt obliged to notify congress about the new emails after having told lawmakers that the matter was closed there have been reports that some members of the fbi were in revolt over comeys earlier decision not to recommend charges against clinton , and that he feared word of the new email investigation would leak to the media , leading to accusations of a cover up , especially if it happened after 8 november he therefore regarded going public now as the least worst option will these events affect the election result \? possible but not probable more than 23 million people have already voted and there is little evidence of movement so far clinton still has a three point lead over trump , according to a politico morning consult poll conducted after comeys intervention and a cbs yougov survey of likely voters across 13 battleground states showed that only 1 of clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her after the announcement her campaign said its own volunteers had been fired up and this would kill any danger of complacency nevertheless , trump believes he has some fresh momentum from a saga he has described as bigger than watergate whichever candidate is dominating the headlines tends to find their poll ratings going down clinton probably has enough of a cushion but the bombshell might yet affect tight races for the house and senate this article was amended on 1 november 2016 an earlier version described harry reid as the house minority leader he is leader of the democrats in the senate topicshillary clintonus elections 2016us politicsfbidemocratsnewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

and cooperative a five byline new york times story reports that republican presidential nominee donald trump availed himself of a tax avoidance method in the early 1990s so legally hazy that trumps own lawyers warned him that the internal revenue service \( irs \) would deem it improper under audit the maneuver , the new york times reports , helped trump avoid reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in cancelled debt resulting from the failure of one of trumps casino businesses as taxable income the irs views cancelled debt in the same light as taxable income which would normally mean that after the floundering of trumps atlantic city casino business and the subsequent cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt , trump would have to pay taxes on that cancelled debt as income the strategy known among tax practitioners as a stock for debt swap relies on mathematical sleight of hand say a company can repay only 60 million of a 100 million bank loan if the bank forgives the remaining 40 million , the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled 40 million debt as taxable income clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience the company would simply swap stock for the 40 million in debt it could not repay this way , it would look as if the entire 100 million loan had been repaid , and presto there would be no tax bill due for 40 million in canceled debt the trump campaign dismissed the times allegations , which are based on documents uncovered during a search of casino bankruptcy filings from the 1990s your e mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law , trump campaign press secretary hope hicks told the new york times your thesis is a criticism , not just of mr trump , but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe mr trump does not think that taxpayers should file returns that resolve all doubt in favor of the irs and any tax experts that you have consulted are engaged in pure speculation there is no news here congress banned the use of stock for debt swaps in 1993
the white house on monday highlighted concerns over the fbi directors decision to announce that the bureau is examining whether newly discovered emails may be relevant to its investigation of hillary clintons use of a private email server fbi director james comey may be under investigation for hatch act violation read morepress secretary josh earnest was careful to say fbi director james comey is regarded by barack obama as a man of integrity and principle but he also noted the importance of longstanding tradition and practice and norms and warned of the risk of communicating with congress earnest said one senior republican official already had suggested that his party was considering impeaching a future president clinton comey has faced a fierce backlash for going public with the new fbi investigation just 11 days before a presidential election , reportedly against the advice and guidelines of attorney general loretta lynch and other senior figures at the department of justice on sunday the fbi obtained a search warrant to begin reviewing the emails , reportedly numbering 650 , 000 and found on the laptop of anthony weiner , estranged husband of clinton aide huma abedin on monday , a spokesman for the office of special counsel indicated that the independent federal agency may be investigating comey over an alleged violation of the hatch act , which guards against federal officials seeking to influence an election at a white house press briefing , earnest said much that could be interpreted as critical of comey , though he declined to do so explicitly the president believes that our democracy has been very well served for more than two centuries by officials at the department of justice and the fbi observing longstanding traditions that limit public discussion of investigations , whether an election is around the corner or not , he said it is clear what director comey has done whats not clear is what led to the decision nobody at the white house has insight into the decision that director comey made im not aware of any of the factors that went into director comeys decision to send this letter to congress on friday asked if the incident could affect the election outcome , earnest replied we certainly have already seen some of secretary clintons harshest critics capitalise on this letter , distort its contents to provoke controversy comeys letter to congress , stating that the fbi is examining newly discovered information that might be pertinent to clintons use of a private email server as secretary of state , has placed a widely respected fbi director in extraordinary political jeopardy earnest dismissed any notion that congress could be seen as an impartial oversight body weve already seen just in the last 72 hours the kind of risk thats associated with communicating to them sensitive information , he said theres one senior republican official , who had previously endorsed the republican nominee for president , whos let it slip that his party was considering impeaching president clinton even before shes been elected , if shes elected facebook twitter pinterest trump whod have thought wed be thanking weiner \? that i think is a pretty clear indication that congress is not at all impartial and thats why many of these norms that apply even when were not talking about someone famous and even when were not talking about an election a week and a half away , should apply the president believes these norms are important and worth upholding the press secretary was at pains to defend comey as an individual , if not his actions in this case the presidents assessment of his integrity and character has not changed , he said for example , the president doesnt believe that director comey is intentionally trying to influence the outcome of an election the president doesnt believe that hes secretly strategising to benefit one candidate or one political party huma abedin has hillary clinton 's closest ally become her biggest liability \? read morehes in a tough spot and hes the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts , including individuals who served in senior department of justice positions and administrations that were led by presidents in both parties but im just not going to be in a position to frankly defend or criticise the decisions that hes made with regard to what to communicate in public an emboldened donald trump has described the revelation as bigger than watergate , but there is little initial evidence the news has upended the presidential race a morning consult politico poll carried out after the announcement put clinton three points ahead , while a cbs yougov survey of likely voters in 13 battleground states showed that only 1 of clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her as a consequence trump claimed on monday that the fbi had stumbled across a digital mother lode and predicted they would discover missing work related emails that had been deleted from clintons computers 650 , 000 emails \? i think you are going to find the 33 , 000 that are missing , he told supporters in michigan i think we hit the mother lode , as they say in the mining industry trump urged comey to resist political pressure hes gotta hang tough because a lot of people think he did the wrong thing , but he did the right thing , he told the grand rapids rally i was not his fan but what he did he brought back his reputation it took guts for director comey to do what he did , he added , to chants of lock her up from the crowd trump has seized on signs of momentum to push into once safe democratic territory in the industrial mid west he was also due to speak in warren in michigan on monday before appearing with running mate mike pence in eau claire , wisconsin , on tuesday until his polling gap began to narrow again last week , trump had been forced back to a dwindling number of swing states , while clinton eyed republican territory in utah , arizona and georgia renewed optimism among republicans has created an unusually vast national battleground , particularly as trumps economic populism scrambles traditional demographic dividing lines michigan and wisconsin have both been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs and were the scene of surprise defeats for clinton in the democratic primary , when large numbers of blue collar workers favoured bernie sanders signs of democratic nervousness in wisconsin became apparent last week when the clinton campaign suddenly announced an advertising blitz sanders has been dispatched to help campaign for clinton in the state on wednesday the impact of early voting may also be forcing trump to look further afield states such as a north carolina have seen heavy early turnout among democrats and may be relatively immune from any late swing away from clinton if he cannot win north carolina but picks up florida and ohio , trumps best hope of pulling off a shock victory will rely on either rustbelt states like michigan and wisconsin or , in the north east , new hampshire , pennsylvania and maine clinton is redoubling her efforts two stops on monday in ohio were to be followed by three in florida on tuesday and another swing to north carolina later in the week most people have decided quite a long time ago what they think about all this , she told a rally in ohio on monday now what people are focused upon is choosing the next president and commander in chief there was less direct criticism of the fbi than over the weekend i am sure a lot of you may be asking what this email business is about and why in the world the fbi would decide to jump into an election without any evidence and its a good a question , she said , to boos from a young crowd at kent state university by all mean they should look at the emails and i am sure they will reach the same conclusion as when they looked at my emails there is no case facebook twitter pinterest hillary clinton reacts to new fbi investigation into her emails the office of special counsel \( osc \) declined to confirm to the guardian whether it is investigating comey for violating the hatch act but on saturday , richard painter , a former ethics lawyer in george w bushs white house , filed an official complaint against comey with the office spokesman nick schwellenbach said in general , osc opens a case after receiving a complaint such investigations can take anywhere from days to months should the osc find comey to have violated the hatch act , and should clinton win the presidency , she may find herself in a position to determine appropriate action for an fbi director slated to serve until 2023 the senates top democrat , harry reid , has openly accused comey of breaking the law to help elect trump the likely investigation adds to a swarm of headaches for comey , who awoke on monday to repudiation from former allies hillary clinton 's email controversy explained what we know so far read moreeric holder , the former attorney general who worked beside comey , wrote a public rebuke in the washington post , warning that comey has jeopardized public trust in both the justice department and the fbi it is incumbent upon him or the leadership of the department to dispel the uncertainty he has created before election day , holder wrote holder also joined nearly 100 former federal prosecutors in blasting comey for inviting considerable , uninformed public speculation about the clinton case , before establishing , by the fbi directors admission , investigative relevance the letter , circulated by the clinton campaign , refrained from characterizing comeys motivations but said he had compromised the non partisan traditions of the department and the fbi meanwhile , clinton suffered another blow from a separate source the ongoing wikileaks release of emails from her campaign chairman , john podesta the latest

three days ago , james comey was one of donald trumps symbols of washington corruption and a law enforcer of the highest integrity to hillary clintons campaign on sunday , the fbi director was the most controversial figure in the capital , heroic to trump , irresponsible to clinton and puzzling to nearly everyone comey has a long history of trying to walk political tightropes , to varying success , dating to the earliest days of his career clinton and trump camps duel over fbi director 's late email revelation read morecomey , a career prosecutor who grew up in new jersey and studied religion and chemistry , had his first brush with a high profile investigation came in 1996 , after a stint with the us attorney for new york that year , he joined a senate investigation into bill and hillary clintons real estate investments , named whitewater after a failed venture they joined he remained in the background of an investigation that ultimately petered out , but comey soon joined two prestigious prosecutors offices , in eastern virginia and manhattan , where he pursued high profile cases against identity thieves , a top credit suisse banker and martha stewart in 2003 , he was named deputy attorney general in the administration of george w bush , becoming a dissenting voice against surveillance programs of the national security agency revealed in 2005 by the new york times comey later testified to congress that one night in march 2004 , with attorney general john ashcroft hospitalized for an emergency procedure , he raced to the sickbed to prevent the renewal of warrantless wiretapping programs which the justice department had determined were illegal comey arrived just before bushs top lawyer and chief of staff , and ashcroft did not sign the renewal i was angry , comey told the senate in 2007 i thought i just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man , who did not have the powers of the attorney general because they had been transferred to me that night was probably the most difficult night of my professional life the next day , bush modified the wiretapping program in those hearings , about possible misconduct by the white house chief counsel and , ironically , missing emails from the republican national committee , comey told congress he felt it imperative that the justice department stand outside partisan politics the department of justice , in my view , is run by political appointees of the president , he testified but once they take those jobs and run this institution , its very important in my view for that institution to be an other in american life my people had to stand up before juries of all stripes , talk to sheriffs of all stripes , judges of all stripes they had to be seen as the good guys , and not as either this administration or that administration comey left the justice department in 2005 for lockheed martin , the largest military contractor in the us , and eventually an investment firm and columbia law school in 2013 , barack obama nominated the registered republican to lead the fbi , joking that the 6ft 8in prosecutor was a man who stands very tall for justice and the rule of law he was confirmed as the agencys seventh director in a 93 1 vote only kentucky senator rand paul voted against him , over domestic drone surveillance and quickly took on a series of controversial cases will hillary clinton lose the election because of the fbi 's email investigation \? read morethough he opposed the nsas warrantless wiretapping , comey has emerged as a steady advocate of us security agencies since the guardian revealed a host of programs in 2013 , a system that gave the fbi access to a trove of data comey has repeatedly argued that security agencies should be given tools to bypass private encryption , and took the fbi to court against apple over unlocking the phone of one of the san bernardino terrorists were asking apple to take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock , he told congress in march its not their job to watch out for public safety thats our job the logic of encryption will bring us to a place in the not too distant future where all of our conversations and all our papers and effects are entirely private the legal battle ended in anticlimax , as the fbi found another way into the iphone it has since said that the hack it used does not work on newer phone models comey has walked a careful line on race and police killings last year he said it was unacceptable that the guardian and washington post had better data on police shootings than the federal government , but also dipped into controversy by suggesting a ferguson effect named after sometimes violent protests in ferguson , missouri , over the police shooting of an unarmed black teen may cause police officers to step back from their responsibilities comey conceded he lacked evidence for that claim , which led him into an unusually public disagreement with the president , who warned last year what we cant do is cherry pick data or use anecdotal evidence to drive policy or to feed political agendas since then , tentative research by the justice department and a st louis criminologist has suggested the ferguson effect is plausible as an explanation for a single year spike in violent crime the director rose to national prominence in july , when he announced the fbis findings in its investigation into whether clinton and her staff had acted criminally in their use of a private email server he concluded there was no evidence of intentional wrongdoing comey used a press conference itself a break from tradition and his original sin , in one former officials words to lay out the facts at the time , correct several false claims by clinton , and castigate her and her staff for their extremely careless email practices he was then called to congress to defend his decision , which ended months of expensive and inconclusive republican investigations facebook twitter pinterest clinton email investigation five key revelations from the fbiyou know what would be a double standard \? if she were prosecuted for gross negligence , comey told the house no reasonable prosecutor would bring the second case in 100 years based on gross negligence its not fair to prosecute someone on these facts , he insisted , calling the procedure celebrity hunting and adding one of the things i have learned in this case is that the secretary may not have been as sophisticated as people would assume asked about his voter registration , comey said he no longer belonged to any party kellyanne conway trump fan chanting jew s a behaved in deplorable way read morethe short letter comey wrote to congressional leaders on friday admits that he does not know whether new emails found on a computer belonging to the estranged husband of a clinton staffer have any significance that lack of information has turned attention to the director himself , who reportedly broke with not only precedent but advice from top justice department officials by going public an internal memo comey sent to staff , leaked to several news organizations , suggests the director felt he had no choice but to act , given his testimony to congress i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record , he wrote at the same time , however , given that we dont know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails , i dont want to create a misleading impression in trying to strike that balance , in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season , there is significant risk of being misunderstood , but i wanted you to hear directly from me about it topicsjames comeyfbihillary clintonus elections 2016us politicsus justice systemnewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

the latest furore over hillary clintons alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in 2009 2013 has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater confusion , with little more than a week to go before voting day the fbis unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into clintons conduct may not be politically motivated , but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged , principally by the unscrupulous republican candidate , donald trump despite this new firestorm , stoked by republicans and rightwing media , it remains likely that american voters will deliver a clear , possibly resounding , rejection of trump on 8 november although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign climaxes , clinton is ahead almost everywhere that matters and she is the sane and reasonable , if uninspiring , choice a trump defeat will be richly deserved as we have noted previously , he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the white house his behaviour during a long , raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign made that abundantly plain yet consigning the donald to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of trumpism this is likely to take a lot longer trumps platform was based not on thought through policies and careful analysis but on prejudice , grievance , ignorance and fear , spiced with opportunism his unexpected success in winning the nomination , despite the republican establishments hostility , reflected his close identification with mainly white , working class and lower middle class voters who , like him , feel angry , undervalued and alienated while public figures such as barack obama , trumps failed republican rival jeb bush and clinton appear to this constituency to be remote , out of touch and uncaring , trumpism peddles the delusion that the candidate is on their side again and again , in ohio , florida and elsewhere , disaffected voters claimed that only trump could be trusted to tell the truth , only trump would keep his promises , only trump could make america great again oblivious to paradox , irony , history or facts , trumpism projects a distorted vision of american greatness the trump doctrine decrees that a nation built by immigrants , that became the most powerful on earth is so scared of migrant and refugee hordes that it must build a 2 , 000 mile wall with mexico trumpism holds that a great nation that incorporated religious tolerance into its groundbreaking constitution and bill of rights must now shatter its own principles and deliberately discriminate against muslims to keep itself safe as general concepts , trumpism makes an enemy of the other , equates nationality with homogeneity , calls honest critics liars and seeks to threaten , jail or harm opponents it says individualism outweighs state authority , as in the unfettered right to bear firearms , but not , perversely , in the case of a womans right to choose abortion trumpism distrusts and fears foreigners it believes free trade , international treaties and economic globalisation in general are loaded dice intended to rip off americans paranoid trumpism holds that long term allies such as germany and japan get a free security ride at americas expense trumpism admires the domestic authoritarianism and international bullying of dictatorships in russia and china vladimir putin is a strong leader standing up for his people , national beliefs and way of life any inconvenient truth that contradicts this or other trumpist narratives is inherently mendacious , part of a web of lies and falsehoods spun by the treacherous mass media conspiring with the establishment to dupe honest citizens and dont forget trumpism cannot be fairly defeated if it loses , it was cheated for sure trumpism appeals to the worst in people , cynically exploiting and fanning the anger , grievances and prejudices of the economically disadvantaged , the embittered , uneducated and plain ignorant it appeals to base instincts , to lowest common denominators its is political dumbing down writ large it is underpinned by a pervasive and comprehensible insecurity , engendered across the west by post 2008 economic injustice and social division , the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent , unfeeling or corrupt governance fear is the common enemy , but fear is trumpisms friend this phenomenon is not confined to america european countries , including britain , experience variations on the theme in germany and france , concern about rising immigration has boosted hardline nationalists whose appeal and disturbing ideology extend far beyond the cathartic issue of syria in greece , poland , austria and hungary , rightwing extremists evil , dehumanising ideas about refugees , migrants and foreigners in general have become a commonplace of political discussion in britain , ukip , provides a noisy echo chamber for some of trumpisms most divisive , chauvinistic and discriminatory refrains if trumpism is indeed a transnational pestilence , it would be wise to look for a common remedy but first , the symptoms must be accurately diagnosed and its long term effects should not be exaggerated much of the political turbulence and iconoclasm witnessed of late in america and europe is the direct result of continuing , negative economic fallout from the 2008 financial crash hard times , austerity cuts , high unemployment and low wages are the manure in which political aberration takes root but as history shows , they sometimes , yet rarely , lead to disaster when economies improve , generally speaking , so too does the quality of political discourse ensuring all people benefit equally from such an improvement is the one certain antidote to extreme politics while protest movements share characteristics and aims , it is also evident that they are not all the same as each other trumpism is an infection others can catch , yet it is also unique to america before panicking about the advance of the far right and far left in europe , commentators in britain and elsewhere should remember that , when all is said and done , mainstream politicians such as angela merkel , alain jupp , mariano rajoy and yes , hillary clinton do , on the whole , get elected or re elected notwithstanding greeces epic upheavals , the centre does mostly hold more than anything else , trumpism will fade and fail because , ultimately , it is a minority pastime , pandering to bigotry , which runs against the grain and spirit of the times , brexit notwithstanding trumpism decries the impact of globalisation , yet globalisation , for all the dislocation and often unwelcome change it brings , is the inescapable way ahead for a more integrated , more connected and more mutually responsible and caring world for good or bad , this clock cannot be turned back closed borders and closed minds , crude nationalism , trade barriers , xenophobia , religious , racial and sexual discrimination these are old mistakes and old hatreds that , while still in evidence everywhere , belong to times past the world is moving forward , not back in the end , trumpism and all its ghastly incarnations , dwelling in fear and darkness , will , like trump himself , be exorcised topicsdonald trumpopinionus elections 2016hillary clintonus

by declining to put up an official candidate to fight the richmond park byelection , the conservative party has shown itself to be cynical , cowardly and rational it took the decision knowing that it is not a great look for the governing party to absent itself from the contest it calculated that it would be an even more dreadful look to field someone in the colours of mrs may and see them slaughtered which is what would have happened the chances of an official tory candidate winning in this leafy patch of southwest london would have been somewhat lower than a flying saucer piloted by elvis and lord lucan landing on the head of the loch ness monster there is no constituency in the country with a more intense concentration of rage about heathrow expansion and the government has just declared that it wants to multiply the number of planes flying over its rooftops the constituency voted heavily to remain within the european union and the government is embarked on a trajectory towards one of the harder versions of brexit a candidate in the name of the tory party would have split the conservative vote , enhancing the chances of the lib dems taking the seat so cowardice and cynicism combined with logic yet this does not mean that the absence of an official competitor for the tory party is an unalloyed blessing for zac goldsmith , the former conservative mp who is recontesting the seat in the guise of an independent once upon a time , when he had a reputation as someone who was not enslaved to his partys line , he might have been convincing in that role not now only a few months ago , he was the conservative candidate for mayor of london moreover , he made the disastrous decision not to run on his own terms , but to be the frontman for a racially charged campaign designed by the tory machine both nasty and ineffective , even his sister , jemima khan , was moved to publicly deplore that campaign only very occasionally in british politics have we seen genuine independents in parliament one such was martin bell , the former bbc correspondent famed for his white suit , who ran and won as the anti sleaze candidate against neil hamilton in tatton at the 1997 election zac goldsmith is no martin bell to see how truly independent he is , we only have to visit the website of the local tory party when i checked there on saturday , the banner at the top of the home page still featured his mugshot alongside the tory logo the strapline read supporting zac goldsmith in the richmond park constituency the video content is a stream of images of the man who is supposedly no longer a member of their party a statement by the chairman says that the association and its resources will not play a part in this byelection , before declaring that individuals who are members of the association may well wish to support zacs campaign and they are at liberty to do so it then provides an email address for joining his campaign statements from the tory party nationally have conveyed their warmest wishes for his re election should he be returned as an mp , it is widely suspected , and he has not denied it , that he will only sit as an independent for a while before , after an interval he judges to be decent , rejoining the tory party if words in politics retain any meaning , zac goldsmith is no independent if he is re elected , it will be a message to mrs may to carry on as you are it is a big challenge to run as a genuine independent because they cant usually compete with the money , logistical capacity and activist base at the disposal of organised parties i guess the money is no obstacle in this case the trustafarian mr goldsmith has exceedingly deep pockets there is an issue over how much support overt or clandestine he is going to get from the conservative party will the tory machine feed him with voter data \? this is a highly valuable commodity , especially at a byelection when turnout is often pivotal to the outcome it seems to be a legal grey area whether the tory party can gift him resources without it counting against the byelection spending limit or whether he should be expected to pay a commercial rate and count that as a campaign expense he starts with some significant advantages he has a well known name , enjoys the benefits of incumbency and won a chunky majority of more than 20 , 000 in 2015 the first opinion poll for what its worth has him comfortably ahead in an age that expects politicians to betray their pledges when they become inconvenient , he may earn credit with some voters for keeping his promise to resign and recontest the seat if his party went ahead with heathrow expansion here , though , is a paradox this byelection may have been triggered by the runway decision , but it is essentially irrelevant to the contest his lib dem rivals are just as opposed to the expansion of heathrow and , unlike mr goldsmiths party , they have always been united in their conviction that it is a terrible idea the lib dems , who came second in the seat in 2015 and held it until 2010 , ache for the boost in media attention and party morale that they would receive from a victory vince cable suggested that he might be up for attempting a comeback there , but in the end he did not apply to be the candidate it concerns some lib dems that their flagbearer , sarah olney , lacks the name recognition and the experience of her opponent , but that has not prevented them from pulling off byelection sensations before tim farrons party seeks to cast the contest as a referendum on the tory government and particularly its trajectory towards a hard brexit this makes sense if they are to see a national revival from their near death experience at the last general election , a good hunting ground for the lib dems is among remain voters alienated from both a brexiteering tory government and corbyn labour on europe , labour is split and scared about how to deal with the division between its london stronghold , which voted heavily for in , and its midland , northern and welsh heartlands , where there was hefty support for out that prevents labour from being a clear voice for the 48 the lib dems dont have that difficulty they can be unequivocal opponents of hard brexit they believe that helped them to do well at the recent witney byelection where they leapfrogged from fourth place to second , with a swing of 19 the swing to them from the tories would only have to be a smidge higher for the lib dems to take richmond park mr goldsmith is at odds with most of his constituents , who voted by more than two to one to remain within the european union it is probably not to his advantage that he is so to the liking of nigel farage that ukip has stood aside from the contest and endorsed him in such an anti brexit constituency , it is of dubious benefit to be the lightly camouflaged candidate of the tory party and the explicit candidate of ukip some hoped that richmond park might be a testing ground for the idea of a progressive alliance between parties on the other side of the spectrum three relatively senior labour figures , clive lewis , lisa nandy and jonathan reynolds , last week jointly suggested that their party should stand aside to maximise the chances of a lib dem victory , on the grounds that in this parliament progressives will need every vote that they can get this was an interesting intervention and the more so because the trio hail from different wings of the party their initiative might even deserve to be called quite brave , for committing the heresy against tribal gods of suggesting that sometimes people should support a party other than their first choice the idea has got nowhere because it received a predictably icy response from the party leadership jeremy corbyn and his deputy , tom watson , dont agree on much on opposing this idea they are as one caroline lucas , the greens only mp , is one of the more eloquent advocates of deeper co operation between non tory parties she visited the richmond greens to see if they might be persuaded to stand aside and found them unwilling she concluded the old politics dies hard sure does this episode is a lesson to the advocates of a progressive alliance about just how hard it will be to turn the concept into something meaningful so there will be labour and green candidates contesting richmond park , even though they dont stand a hope of winning this may not ultimately matter if the lib dems can get one of their bandwagons rolling , they will put a hard squeeze on support for the also rans the british electorate has a lot of experience of byelections they understand the dynamics and act accordingly richmond park has the highest proportion of university graduates in the country they shouldnt have much problem grasping the concept of tactical voting nor should they have much difficulty spotting the difference between a genuine independent and a fake topicszac

as a fractious and often sordid presidential campaign reaches its denouement , hillary clinton may be reflecting upon the grim irony that it is anthony weiner who has provided what could be the final , miserable twist hillary clinton demands fbi give details on latest email inquiry 'immediately' read moreweiners predilection for sending sexually laden text messages derailed his career in congress and his chances of becoming mayor of new york city , but his soap opera style re emergence in the 11th hour of the presidential race may yet trigger the greatest political carnage of all his appearance comes in an election already defined by allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by clintons husband , former president bill clinton , and by the republican nominee , donald trump on friday , clinton called on the fbi to immediately explain its announcement that it was reviewing a new batch of emails relating to her , after a review of her use of a private email server was closed in july then , the fbi director , james comey , said clinton had been extremely careless in her use of a private server while secretary of state , but said there were no grounds for a criminal investigation on friday , he said in a letter to members of congress that the bureau would analyze newly discovered emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation republicans were quick to characterise the move as a reopening of the investigation into clintons server , a description democrats rejected it was later reported that the new emails came from an ipad , cellphone and laptop seized by the fbi and previously shared by weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin , a top clinton aide clintons campaign and the obama administration have been left bewildered by the latest fbi intervention , less than two weeks before the election , with weiners involvement rubbing salt into the wound john podesta , clintons campaign chairman , said director comeys letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case , but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant well , oh god , anthony weiner i should not comment im not a big fan i wasnt before he got in troublejoe bidenit is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election vice president joe biden was more direct , telling cnns michael smerconish in an interview broadcast on saturday well , oh god , anthony weiner i should not comment on anthony weiner im not a big fan i wasnt before he got in trouble weiner is being investigated by the fbi and police in north carolina over text messages sent to a 15 year old girl in the wake of the latest allegations against him , abedin , who has herself been a target for criticism from republicans for some time , separated from weiner she has continued in her role as clintons closest ally on the campaign trail once seen as a rising democratic star , weiner was forced to resign from congress in 2011 after he sent a picture of his penis , clad in his boxer shorts , to a 21 year old student via twitter after he initially denied involvement in the messages , further pictures sent by weiner emerged and he stepped down , at the urging of barack obama a redemptive quest to become mayor of his hometown , new york city , gained traction in 2013 , with several polls showing he had a decent chance of beating the longtime clinton ally bill de blasio , the man who would eventually get the democratic nomination and win the election in a landslide however , weiners campaign was wounded after he admitted that a self taken picture of his penis , which appeared on the internet , was in fact his weiner had sent the picture to a 22 year old woman he made contact with after leaving congress , using the now infamous alias carlos danger in his interactions with her in a statement at the time , weiner said i said that other texts and photos were likely to come out , and today they have these things that i did were wrong and hurtful to my wife and caused us to go through challenges in our marriage that extended past my resignation from congress this behavior is behind me ive apologized to huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness abedin initially spoke in defense of weiner but the former congressmans election hopes were further tarnished after he admitted sending sexually explicit messages to several other women another low point arrived when weiner was continually asked what is wrong with you \? during an excruciating live interview with the msnbc host lawrence odonnell as shown in an eponymous fly on the wall documentary released earlier this year , weiner refused to bow out of the race despite the anguish of his staff and abedin , who often looked on in silence as her husband attempted to extricate himself from the scandal weiner was subjected to taunts from the public and became embroiled in a two minute argument with a jewish voter who had criticized his marriage to an arab weiner retorted youre my judge \? what rabbi taught you that \? weiners campaign ended in high farce the candidate was crushed with just 4 9 of the vote and was forced to dodge sydney leathers , a woman who said she had received sexual messages from him , while giving his concession speech the weiner documentary showed the candidate scrambling through a mcdonalds restaurant to enter the adjoining building for his speech in order to avoid leathers , who was waiting outside as part of a media stunt facebook twitter pinterest trump gleefully responds to new fbi probe into clinton emailsabedin , who has become an increasingly public figure in her own right as clintons top aide , announced her separation from weiner in august after long and painful consideration and work on my marriage weiner and abedin have a young son the split was expected to mark the end of the saga but , in what clinton will view as a cruel irony , weiners communications have become an issue again at the worst possible time for the former secretary of state weiner review mayoral motormouth makes for painfully compelling viewing read morewhile there is no evidence the emails involve clinton as a sender or recipient , the new investigation has allowed donald trump to pounce last year , the republican nominee said weiner was a perv and a security risk due to his proximity to clinton , through abedin on friday , a gleeful trump told a rally that the welcomed the new fbi investigation and that the system might not be as rigged as i thought the developments have helped bolster trump at a time of plummeting poll numbers that have provoked wild , unproven claims by the real estate tycoon that the election is being fraudulently taken from him the 2016 election now faces the prospect of being defined by the sexual behaviour of three men trump , weiner and bill clinton trump , who has appeared with women who accuse former president clinton of inappropriate sexual behaviour , has been accused by several women of making unwanted advances and has boasted on tape and on camera of grabbing women by the genitals and getting away with it , due to his wealth and fame topicsanthony weinerthe observerhillary clintondemocratsus elections 2016us politicsfbianalysisshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
you know i still make bangladesh favourites theyve got a decent lead very quickly and , despite mahmadullahs brain fade , batting to come that has plenty of potential runs in it im off tobed do more work , but do join me again at about 3am gmt tomorrow morning for what promises to be a cracker of a fourth day cheers for reading and apologies for any tweets and emails i couldnt use bye ! ben stokes and zafar ansari help england hang on against bangladesh read more 31st over bangladesh 152 3 \( imrul 59 \) alastair cook is told he cant bowl finn in this light , so zafar returns i guess this will be the penultimate over , although the way hes taking his time could well make it the last imrul comes forward to the second ball and looks to defend , but is nutmegged outside leg stump by the low bounce theres a sense of panic when he turns back and heads towards his crease , but hes fine cook brings in the men from long on and long off to catching positions and the pressure tells ! the very last ball of the day brings the wicket england wanted and theyll be buoyed going into tomorrow bangladesh lead by 128 with seven wickets in hand utterly idiotic from mahmadullah he goes for the huge slog sweep and ruins all his hard work by missing a straight one down go the stumps on the last ball of the day 30th over bangladesh 150 2 \( mahmadullah 46 , imrul 58 \) on sky , mike atherton is talking about playing with his dog , which makes me want to be mates with mike atherton all the more mahmadullah is playing a fine innings himself here , scurrying and busy , and moving to 46 from 54 balls with a clip to midwicket for a well run two and a push to mid on for one the 150 comes up and we can start thinking about what kind of total bangladesh will want to defend another 120 runs and itd be a corker of a fourth innings 29th over bangladesh 147 2 \( mahmadullah 43 , imrul 58 \) another overthrow after a pointless shy at the stumps by , i think , ballance it looks like hes been exiled to the deep for that one a googly out the rough takes imrul by surprise and takes the shoulder of the bat , but theres no catcher in place twice the batsman sweeps and the second time it works , beating the sweeper duckett and skidding away for imruls eighth boundary 28th over bangladesh 138 2 \( mahmadullah 40 , imrul 52 \) into the last over then , which moeen will bowl imrul misses a big sweep and is very careful to keep his back foot planted in the crease with bairstow lurking ominously behind moeen needs to take a wicket to prevent this from being bangladeshs day , despite that 99 run ninth wicket stand for england er it looks like were carrying on of course weve had the minimum overs for the day its looking dark out there too 27th over bangladesh 135 2 \( mahmadullah 38 , imrul 51 \) john starbuck writes dan , tms are reminding us that , as the clocks go back tonight , their official start time will be 03 45 gmt , so why bother going to bed \? those crazy , irresponsible tms guys , eh \? im opening up the obo tomorrow , so ive just spent rashids over swearing loudly while barry glendenning and gregg bakowski laugh at me imrul moves to a fine 50 with a reverse sweep that goes fine and down to third man this has been an excellent innings from the man whom some thought of as a jumped up odi player before this series 26th over bangladesh 127 2 \( mahmadullah 36 , imrul 46 \) woakes is off , moeen is on with just three overs left bairstow , who is getting increasingly irritating behind the stumps , screams his head off for lbw against imrul , who dug a full ball out with his bat about a foot away from his boot cook , unlike mushfiqur this morning , is not impressed enough to call for a review theres a better shout a couple of balls later when mahmadullah is hit on the pad from round the wicket , but moeen turns away without appealing himself 25th over bangladesh 124 2 \( mahmadullah 33 , imrul 45 \) another call for a catch from behind the stumps , but rashids leg break just looped up off the pad with daylight between bat and ball two singles from the over drop the run rate below five , which is a victory of sorts for england the lead is 100 24th over bangladesh 122 2 \( mahmadullah 32 , imrul 44 \) two more boundaries woakes strays on to the ankles , mahmadullah steps back and across and whips it fine for four to bring up the 50 partnership from 61 balls fine stuff that from the hosts , whose run rate is incredibly still around five an over root , incidentally , is off the field with an upset stomach then four balls later woakes puts a half volley in the slot and imrul reaches into the coaching manual and pulls out the cover drive sara torvalds \( saraxcricket \) oi , danlucas86 , england needs a wicket ! what are you planning to do about that \? howzat \? ! banvengoctober 29 , 2016run out bowling \? 23rd over bangladesh 113 2 \( mahmadullah 27 , imrul 40 \) nice shot from mahmadullah , going back in his crease and punching against the spin to mid on for just one you kinda feel he deserved more imrul then brings out the reverse sweep and zafar comes round to save a couple with a good slide the bangladesh batsmen play that shot well , getting across and right on top of the ball to smother the spin a leading edge along the ground and through gully , off the googly , brings two more then a clip off the pads lands a foot or so short of buttler at midwicket you are kidding me \? says a grumpy rashid and his mood wont be helped by imrul thwacking the final ball on the pull , through midwicket for four 22nd over bangladesh 104 2 \( mahmadullah 26 , imrul 32 \) belatedly , chris woakes is introduced to the attack and mahmadullahs single takes bangladesh to 100 with minimal fanfare imrul reaches for a full , wide one and bairstow appeals for a catch behind , but im not convinced he even believes that one himself given his grin he cashes in with a glorious pull shot , from a waist high short ball and crashed through midwicket with a lovely woody sound for four simon mcmahon updates us arrived in glasgow apparently joe and casper are here too yeah , me neither theyre youtubers apparently but at least mrs mcmahon kept me up to date with the cricket on the way through , asking at one point so , do both teams get a go at batting and bowling every day \? its been that kind of test , hasnt it \? sometimes i think i should be a youtuber theyve all got loads of money and i see their grinning , shiny faces and nice teeth and bad hair everywhere when i get dragged to bookshops by the other half \( buy a kindle , luddites \) but i have a voice like a constipated tom waits , apparently 21st over bangladesh 99 2 \( mahmadullah 25 , imrul 28 \) change of bowling as zafar , who looked increasingly confident , takes a break and is replaced by adil rashid the leggie played a fine innings with the bat earlier and he turns one square out of the rough , albeit well outside leg stump and almost worth calling a wide once again imrul top edges an attempted slog sweep and again it lands safe , this time around backward square they take two 20th over bangladesh 96 2 \( mahmadullah 24 , imrul 26 \) id haul stokes off now , given he looks knackered and could well be englands most effective bowler when the ball gets properly old the covers are being readied , while on the field a pair of singles push bangladeshs lead to 72 the final ball induces an inside edge that thuds into pads when it could so easily have been stumps such are the fine margins etc 19th over bangladesh 94 2 \( mahmadullah 23 , imrul 25 \) its raining , so not sure how much longer this will last id be surprised if we get the 10 remaining over in imrul lives dangerously , top edging a booming slog sweep but the ball falls wide of moeen at midwicket it would have been hard for him to watch that one in the air although theres little excusing the fielding sloppiness that allows a couple of overthrows a few balls later 18th over bangladesh 90 2 \( mahmadullah 20 , imrul 24 \) stokes continues after drinks and it looks like the clouds have given way a bit its certainly brighter there imrul drives and it comes off the thick outside edge , going through point and slightly in the air rather than booming through cover as he intended the ball before that , stokes got a bouncer all wrong and it was called a wide on height the final ball is on the openers pads and whipped hard , square , aerially and safe for two king of the wicketkeeper chat was surely paul mad as a badger nixon , says phil russell his most celebrated comments have had plenty of airings previously , but my favourite remains the one where he innocently asks the batsman do you hold you breath when you play your shots \? which as a subtle way of getting into a batsman head is so much better than the usual come on lads , this lot are a bunch of redacteds nonsense that seems to proliforate these days that is actually pretty good shameless self promotionheres some actual journalism i did london welsh still hopeful of financial saviour amid uncertainty over future read more its drinks 17th over bangladesh 85 2 \( mahmadullah 19 , imrul 21 \) despite those two wickets , mahmadullah reckons attack is still the way to go against zafar and he waits for the full ball on middle , then clumps it nicely back over the bowlers head for the 14th boundary of the innings imrul hasnt scored a run since the 12th over apparently zafar ansari also plays the piano any excuse for this 16th over bangladesh 81 2 \( mahmadullah 15 , imrul 21 \) there are ostensibly 12 overs left today after this one but it is very dark now and rain is forecast for around about now a maiden 15th over bangladesh 81 2 \( mahmadullah 15 , imrul 21 \) zafar continues and is looking better with every over that wicket might have given bangladesh second thoughts about trying to dismissively swat him from the attack a lovely drifting ball turns and beats mahmadullah , who eventually gets four with a very lovely sweep from outside off from the last ball good bowling and good batting in that over tim de lisle \( timdelisle \) danlucas86 zafar ansari becomes the first person ever to deliver 40 , 000 words on civil rights and take a test wicket in the same yearoctober 29 , 2016 14th over bangladesh 75 2 \( mahmadullah 9 , imrul 21 \) the new new man mahmadullah \( not a typo \) is off the mark in style after stokes takes a wicket with the first ball a swivel pull dismisses a short ball to fine leg for four , then a lovely crisp cover drive doubles it the clouds are coming over hi dan hi , derek walmsley im not really feeling bairstows lyrical flow behind the stumps bit blood and thunder for my liking i wonder if you had any favourite wicket keeper cheerleaders \? matt prior was a bit more bright and up tempo , and i remember the odd engagingly hysterical laugh from gilchrist im not a fan of any wicketkeeper chat theyre the cricketing equivalent of scrum halfs and need shutting up promptly and theres a dent in mominuls test average a good line , just back of a length from stokes and he cant resist a little prod cook goes to his left and clings on 13th over bangladesh 66 1 \( mominul 1 , imrul 21 \) zafar ansaris first test wicket quietens the crowd and brings the 53 mominul haque to the crease hes a fine player , with a test average of 53 and three hundreds , including ones against new zealand and sri lanka id imagine bangladesh will slow things down and just look to accumulate now shows what i know tamim plays a rare tentative shot and pays the price prodding forward it goes from inside edge , to pad , to cook at leg slip 12th over bangladesh 65 0 \( tamim 40 , imrul 21 \) the batsmen are , understandably , watchful against stokes his third ball is short , wide rubbish angled across imrul but hes not tempted he does pull hard at a straighter bouncer but doesnt get hold of it , the ball tumbling to midwicket for just a single with his final ball he knocks the stumps with his bowling hand , a no ball , and looks to have hurt it a bit indeed at the end of the over he runs off andy potts responds to the 10th over the way bangladesh are scoring the ball will be roughed up in no time finn has never really shined as a bowler for england whats happened to stuart broad \?

10th over bangladesh 56 0 \( tamim 33 , imrul 20 \) the boundaries are flowing and bangladesh are scoring at an odi rate imrul drops his hands and edges wide of the slips and down to the rope at third man to bring up the 50 for bangladesh a single , then tamim plays an absolutely brilliant lofted cover drive , hard and over the close field for four more this is cracking stuff andy potts writes i would have had stokes open the bowling with his figures in the first innings to keep it tight and to keep the pressure on , then ali at the other end to make things happen mo yes , but i think its wise to keep stokes back and let the spinners rough up the ball so he can get it reversing i dont see stokes as a new ball kind of bowler 9th over bangladesh 46 0 \( tamim 28 , imrul 15 \) down the leg side from zafir and imrul sweeps hard , but he can only get one as theres a sweeper coming round tamim likes the sweep too and , when zafir tosses one on off stump he reverses it beautifully to pick up four more hes 28 from 28 balls now 8th over bangladesh 41 0 \( tamim 24 , imrul 14 \) catch ! is the cry as imrul sweeps hard and in the air out towards square leg it goes too fast for stokes out in the deep to pick it up and away the ball goes for four it was a big ask for the durham man to get to that at what point do we have to ask whether finn will ever realise his clear potential \? asks elliot wilson its during sessions like these , where finn really needs to find lightning in a bottle , that he tends to go missing its a fair question finn is 27 now and should really be at his peak im more worried about buttler hes one of the biggest talents england have had in a generation and they cant waste him as well as finn i dont think the bowler is going to make it , going on gut feeling 7th over bangladesh 35 0 \( tamim 23 , imrul 9 \) finn is off but its zafir ansari rather than woakes ansari is another one im not sure about yes he was the next cab off the rank , but that was a year ago and weve had an entire county season between the pakistan series in the uae and now , during which he was easily outbowled by ollie rayner he overpitches to tamim and again that bottom hand comes into play , drilling it through extra cover for four two balls later he flicks one just short of cook at leg slip the camera angle on the replay doesnt show us whether or not it carried but my suspicion is that it didnt 6th over bangladesh 29 0 \( tamim 18 , imrul 8 \) now imrul gets in on the boundary game , sweeping very nicely from outside off and behind square for his first four and the first off of moeen bangladesh lead in what is now essentially a one innings match speaking of mo , heres a good question from neil delaney moeen was opening the batting last year the bowling now there cant be too many others to do this sobers \? i dont think kallis ever opened the batting did he \? 5th over bangladesh 24 0 \( tamim 18 , imrul 3 \) personally id have woakes on for finn in fact id probably have opened with woakes in fact i probably wouldnt have picked finn , whose first innings effort can kindly be described as anodyne he twices asks for lbw against tamim but with curbed enthusiasm , as the ball was twice going well down the leg side tamim gets his third boundary , using his bottom hand and excellent timing to shovel a full ball through extra cover that levels the scores in no time at all your guitar hero is bieber \? asks patrick harvey for shame ! try this instead my guitar hero is david gilmour just look at this 4th over bangladesh 18 0 \( tamim 13 , imrul 3 \) a thick outside edge from the first ball goes to slip , but it was played with soft hands by imrul and dribbled along the ground after a leg bye , tamim plays a nice cut off a wide ball but can only get a single to point when hes in this kind of nick , tamim is a lovely player to watch benedict bermange \( benedict b \) mehedi just the third bowler to take a six wicket haul in each of his first two tests after alec bedser and narendra hirwanioctober 29 , 2016 3rd over bangladesh 16 0 \( tamim 12 , imrul 3 \) finn gives round the wicket a brief go to imrul kayes and to little avail after a single he goes too full to tamim , whose first innings hundred is looking increasingly outstanding he looks good here , too , leaning into that ball and clipping it off his ankles with gorgeous timing and through to the midwicket boundary another overpitched ball is knocked in front of square leg for two more the lead is down to eight 2nd over bangladesh 9 0 \( tamim 6 , imrul 2 \) its moeen from the other end , with two slips in place for the left handers mushfiqur didnt use his spinners especially well as englands ninth wicket eroded bangladeshs lead , so itll be interesting to see how cook does theres a big shout for lbw when tamim prods forward but he was hit outside the line , as both moeen and bairstow point out so cook doesnt review jim procter blain writes just thought id point out that justin bieber is not a talented musician if he was , then all those girls wouldnt have been screaming to get out at his concert arf 1st over bangladesh 7 0 \( tamim 5 , imrul 1 \) steven finn is opening the bowling for england and , after a couple of singles , he gets an inside edge from tamim with a ball that rises sharply and clumps via bat into pad in comes short leg tamim gets his first boundary off a short , wide ball that he murders through point with a mighty cut a leg bye concludes the over theyve actually taken it early , which i didnt realise , and now ive missed my chance to go to tescos vending machine for crisps it it john ryan is angry john ryan didnt get up early for this kinda crap john ryan has not been watching tests for too long bangladeshs only hope of ever being a competitive test team is if theres a rule change that allows them to have a new ball at the beginning of every over , he writes one of the most shambolic few hours of cricket ive ever seen bangladesh will have a mini session to negotiate before tea in the meantime , simon mcmahon writes morning dan i dont know much about belgian folk music , but i am going to glasgow to see justin bieber tonight \( escorting teenage daughters , thats all , ive not got a ticket myself , you understand \) apparently he wants to be a musician well , justin , i want to play cricket like ben stokes and write songs like neil hannon , but it aint gonna happen anyway , cocktails on me if this test is tied i hate to say it but biebs is a talented guy i even quite like a couple of his songs though i couldnt name any i got a new guitar yesterday \( early birthday present , thanks liz ! \) and cant do this 82nd over england 244 \( rashid 44 \) taijul continues and beats finn , before ending englands resistance a couple of balls later england have a slim lead but its in the balance thats it the new ball turns and bounces away from finns bat he follows it and gets the finest edge , which mushfiqur takes well new ball taken81st over england 243 9 \( finn 0 , rashid 43 \) to no great surprise , and as you can see from that big chunky text above , bangladesh take the new ball straight away their reviews have been topped up too , like a number of lives when you get 100 gold coins in the original super mario mehedi , over the wicket , has the new ball as well as a slip , short leg , leg slip and shortish midwicket , and its the second of those who snares him with an excellent catch , diving to his left mehedi has six and englands fine ninth wicket stand comes to an end on 99 woakess fine stand comes to an end he likes the look of an off break , on his pads , and flicks it round the corner , straight into the hands of leg slip
im mid 40s and have stalled but how do i compete for jobs with younger people \? i am in my 40s and have worked all my life in several sectors but ive come to a standstill in my career where im working for the nhs as a doctors receptionist dragons , wannabe doctors , as everyone calls us this , of course , is not true , but why bother to explain , it will make no difference i want a change , but feel like im an old person in a new , just out of school and willing to learn make a difference world how do i prove that i can be the right person for the job with my expansive work history over all these teens \? jeremy saysdoctors receptionists form a human buffer zone between two groups of distracted people the doctors , doing their best to diagnose and treat multiple patients every day , usually in 10 minute segments , and trying and often failing to keep to an impossible timetable and their patients , often anxious parents , with health concerns that make them more than normally self centred i can sense from your letter that the daily experience of being held responsible for circumstances wholly outside of your control has taken its toll that is all too understandable , but you must try very hard not to let your sense of grievance show one of the most unattractive characteristics you can reveal in an interview is world weariness , bordering on bitterness and cynicism no one wants to import such an attitude into their workplace and it will count heavily against you sometimes its not a prejudice againstolder people , as such , that works against them in stark contrast with the bright eyed optimism of the young , its the way they can exude a sense of cynicism and hopelessness you want a change , but the chances are that your best bet of finding something satisfying to do will have some connection , even if slight , with some part of your previous expansive work history think systematically of all the jobs youve done , and all the different situations youve encountered , and pick a couple youd like to return to and then , just as systematically , list not what youd want from such positions but what you with all your experience could contribute to them thats what any application you make must positively project enthusiasm , real understanding of the specific task concerned , and with an emphasis on what you believe you could bring to it you cant prove that you would be the right person for a job , nobody can but you can , entirely legitimately , present yourself as a very attractive prospect readers say if being an administrator has been your primary experience over the past 20 years then there are a great many senior administrator positions that you could apply for , highlighting your extensive experience including customer facing work and the associated managing of unexpected events under pressure etc but you sound frustrated , so take some time to work on your mind set fatherlarryduff consider a larger employer , as you will have access to internal vacancies , secondment opportunities and staff development be proactive about your skills gaps and focus on redirecting your career with energy , determination and positivity therunninggirl i am 40 , and my closest colleague at work , on the same management level as i am , is 25 and has many skills i dont have and recognises that i have some skills he doesnt yet have either we learn from each other id say treat your colleagues with respect , do the job to the best of your ability , and show rather than tell those around you your abilities if you have talent and are assertive you should be able to shine , but dont belittle those who are different from you tacitanontacit wait until you reach your 50s stevenhope1964i want to help people and work in recruitment , but am always told that im too nicei have worked in the relentless business of employment advice so long that i have become disillusioned about what transferable skills i have ive dealt with customers who have been unemployed for decades , and helped those with severe disabilities or that are suicidal and in need of mental health assessments i first thought that i could go into recruitment , but after about six interviews i got told by every company that i am either not hungry enough or am too nice for recruitment my current job is not giving me the hours i would like and i am looking over my shoulder every day waiting for the boss to say , well this is your last day , they pulled the plug i have all the experience in the world but not one qualification to my name i have been promised qualifications left right and centre but when i have asked about them the answer is usually something about them trying to get the funding where else do i fit , what else can i do \? i love helping people but recruitment thinks im not evil enough jeremy saysa bit like the reader before , you show signs of allowing your disillusionment to colour your entire approach to finding agreeable work again , thats completely understandable but if it becomes apparent in your manner it can only harm your prospects i doubt if your lack of qualifications is holding you back in feedback , recruiters often cite an absence of qualifications as an objective reason for rejecting an applicant , when in truth the reason was more subjective where the right job is concerned , your extensive experience should more than compensate for the absence of more formal training i would strongly encourage you not to abandon recruitment as a prime goal the fact youve been called for interview six times is encouraging not all companies share the same hard edged attitude to recruitment and staff management that youve so far encountered you have long experience of working with the long term unemployed , the severely disabled and those with mental health problems and still you love helping people please hang on to that central truth whatever you do , dont even think of pretending to be less nice or more evil you wouldnt convince anyone and youd feel a fraud with optimistic perseverance , and employing some of the tips ive suggested to the reader above , you have every chance of finding what youre looking for readers say it sounds like youve been applying to recruitment agencies where the role is essentially a sales role one option is to look at in house recruiters where the roles are much more about assessment and selection , which sound like they would use your skills much better you could also look at applying for entry level recruitment and or hr roles often these come with the ability to do day release to gain a professional qualification with the cipd elizaben you work at the pointy end of human problems , which few people can do this makes you a relatively rare commodity would it help to approach yourself as if you were one of your own clients , and make the case for yourself that you would for them \?

were going close our rolling coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign , with a few hours and 10 days before election day you can read a summary of the days events here , about hillary clintons subsequent remarks on the new fbi review here , and about a falsehood strewn speech by donald trump in iowa here hillary clinton reacts to new fbi investigation into her emailshillary clinton demands fbi explain review of new batch of emails read more were a divided nation but we are fighting to bring us all together , like here tonight theres love here theres love , trump says we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again god bless you with that trump closes out his rally we have the highest murder in this country in 45 years , trump says , very falsely trump is distorting an fbi statistic into a false claim in september the agency reported that murders and non negligent manslaughter rose in the us by 10 8 in 2015 , the largest single year increase since 1971 that is not the same as saying there are more murders in the us than at any point since 1971 15 , 696 murders were reported in 2015 , down from 1991 and 1993 highs of 24 , 703 and 24 , 526 there were more murders in 1971 \( 17 , 780 \) than in 2015 the murder rate declined 42 from 1993 to 2014 , even though the population increased by a quarter during this weeks debate trump almost cited the statistic accurately , saying we have an increase in murder within our cities , the biggest in 45 years the fbi figure is a national one , not restricted to cities you dont hear that from these people , he adds , gesturing toward the press they dont want to talk about it you can read our report on it , from the day of the release and before trump remarked on it , through the link below murders up 10 8 in biggest percentage increase since 1971 , fbi data shows read more when i am elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists out of this country , trump says , without details and yes , we will build the wall and yes , mexico will pay for the wall 100 100 the cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what were talking about , trump says nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would cost at least 25bn the us goods trade deficit with mexico is about 58bn , which is offset by the us surplus in services of 9 2bn if not for the open border policies of this administration , trump says , countless americans would be alive today the us does not have open borders , and barack obama has deported more than 2 5 million people , a record as trump himself noted at hte final presidential debate hillary has pledged open borders , trump says , and supports sanctuary cities clinton does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the us , and she supports obamas executive actions to shield some migrants , such as people who were brought to the us as children like obama , she supports deportation for people with criminal records we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan this is only true if youre in the wealthiest bracket of american earners half of trumps tax cuts would go to the top 1 of earners , according to the tax policy center , and most families below the top 20 of earners would have income gains of less than 1 trump doesnt linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of drain the swamp , his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in washington forty five percent of african american children under the age of six are in poverty , trump says inaccurately , citing outdated data per politifact the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great recession , but they have since eased , to somewhere between 20 percent and 37 percent , depending on which income threshold you use still , the rates for african american children are disproportionately high , so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on balance , we rate the statement half true another two million hispanic americans have fallen into poverty under the obama administration , he says , also falsely per the guardians own fact check trumps use of two million is misleading on two points he starts counting from 2008 , when george w bush was still in office and from right before the financial crisis peak and he ignores that the hispanic population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost 1 4 million hispanic people fell below the poverty line between 2008 and 2009 , census poverty numbers show , but the number of hispanic people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in 2015 it fell to 21 4 , down from 25 2 in 2009 it will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your heirs , he says , alluding to the so called death tax on inheritance , though the estate tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of americans trump then moves on to saying that hes really moving in the polls , and that hes leading in many of them this is not true , as election models and poll averages show i dont know whats going to happen now , trump continues so much is at stake in this election when we win in november we are going to have honest government once again hillary clinton destroyed 33 , 000 emails destroyed 13 iphones he then says , without evidence , that clinton put her office up for sale to corporations and foreign donors hacked emails show concerns within the campaign that clintons husband , bill , was too close with various donors , but no one has found evidence of a favor returned in exchange for donations to the clintons charitable foundation trump moves on to reminiscing about how , last june , he came down an elevator with his wife to announce his presidential campaign he abruptly segues into saying how were going to be the smart country once again , and saying we never win anymore abroad he correctly says that the white house has admitted healthcare premiums will increase by as much as 25 next year , but then misleadingly says that the true number is twice that premiums will increase by varying amounts according to each state some will be quite high , as trump warns , others will be far lower trump then correctly notes that obama misled americans about whether they could keep their doctor under the affordable care act repealing and replacing obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on november 8 , trump says donald trump appears on stage in cedar rapids , iowa he thanks everybody as youve heard , earlier today , the fbi after discovering new emails the crowd cheers is reopening their investigation into hillary clinton this is not technically correct comey said the emails are part of a new review pertaining to the prior investigation lock her up , the crowd chants the investigation is the biggest political scandal since watergate , and its everybodys hope that justice at last can be delivered in the very brief remarks tonight hillary clinton tonight tried to politicize this investigation , trump continues , by attacking and falsely accusing the fbi director of only sending the letter to republicans another clinton lie as it turns out it was sent to both republican and democratic leaders trump says that the fbi would never have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious criminal offense i give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong justice will prevail trump has suggested for months that the fbi has acted politically to hide alleged corruption someone is back at the podium after more than 45 minutes of waiting its not donald trump , but he praises the candidate , who is reportedly en route hes put his finger on a deeply underappreciated body of people , the man at the podium says he is going to be the next president of the united states of america then the man leaves the stage lets get the next president up here as of 6 45pm pt , trump has an 18 5 chance of winning the election and hillary clinton has a 81 5 chance , according to fivethirtyeights election model far from the podium in cedar rapids , vice president joe biden was asked by cnn about the new fbi review and the role that disgraced congressman anthony weiner plays in it kevin liptak \( kevinliptakcnn \) biden to cnn on new emails biden oh god anthony weiner i should not comment on anthony weiner im not a big fan october 29 , 2016meanwhile , the republican candidate has at last landed in the correct state donald j trump \( realdonaldtrump \) just landed in iowa speaking soon ! october 29 , 2016 trump is now an hour and 15 minutes late to his own rally , but reporting continues to trickle out from washington on fbi director james comeys decision to announce a review into emails of unknown significance officials speaking on condition of anonymity have told the washington post that he sent a cryptic letter today because of politics within the agency and with congress fbi director james b comey decided to inform congress that he would look again into hillary clintons handling of emails during her time as secretary of state for two main reasons a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup the rationale , described by officials close to comeys decision making on the condition of anonymity , prompted the fbi director to release his brief letter to congress on friday and upset a presidential race less than two weeks before election day it placed comey again at the center of a highly partisan argument over whether the nations top law enforcement agency was unfairly influencing the campaign in a memo explaining his decision to fbi employees soon after he sent his letter to congress , comey said he felt an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed of course , we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations , but here i feel i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record , comey wrote to his employees greg sargent \( theplumlinegs \) important new reporting from sarihorwitz suggests comey sent letter because he felt pressure from inside https t co wwjrqgcqjh pic twitter com 0twuxnqapqoctober 29 , 2016 blum talks about john boehner , the former speaker of the house blum brags that he voted against boehner , a veteran republican leader , for that position i

belly of the beast for two years we are staring into the abyss i need your help will you help me \? he says he needs the audience to tell them about blum he begins talking about how his father fought in the second world war with a 10th grade education trump is nearly an hour late a mustachioed man named jeff addresses the crowd before trump , who is approximately 40 minutes late to the cedar rapids rally the man is shouting , and praising various republican candidates he says that voters are going to terrify democrats make them shiver and shake , cause theres a change a coming , and i can feel it in the air ! what hillary clinton did with those emails , i know its politically advantageous , but you know what folks , we had a secretary of state put our national security , thats your children , thats your grandchildren at stake folks , im a history professor , im going to tell you right now the history of our country , the history of our country , we dont have a precedent for whats going on jeff doesnt actually say anything about fbi agents july conclusions that clinton was extremely careless , or that they found no evidence that her server had been hacked , though they thought it at risk goetz returns im glad jeff got that out of his system a congressman , rod blum , appears on stage hello o o o , deplorables ! he says he represents iowans in washington dc , which he then says is infested and a swamp we are fed up with the lying , we are fed up with the corruption , we are fed up with people who go there to serve themselves , he says still waiting for donald trump , tana goetz , a former apprentice contestant , comes out onto the stage to pep up the crowd by dismissing hillary clinton just across the river then someone holds a moment of prayer for donald trump and mike pence then goetz introduces a man to lead the crowd in the pledge of allegiance a cedar rapids music teacher takes the lead for the national anthem goetz says that trump took a chance on me , a woman , an iowan , and an entrepreneur what he showed me was enough to put my successful careers on hold , she says , to campaign for trump hes got a huge heart , she says i know this mans heart and it is good and he genuinely loves people you cant live in new york city and not love people this last statement is not true but goetz goes on to say that she knows how much this man loves this country he doesnt need this job donald trumps gonna win this thing in a landslide and its gonna happen i predicted it and its gonna happen she then says the fbi is re opening the case , alluding to the new review into a new batch of emails related to hillary clinton , and the crowd chants lock her up as we wait for trump to speak in iowa , the state has reported its third suspected case of attempted voter fraud in a donald trump supporter , according to the des moines register terri lynn rote , 55 , was booked into the polk county jail about 3 40pm thursday on a first degree election misconduct charge , which is a class d felony rote , a registered republican , reportedly cast an early voting ballot at the polk county election office , 120 second ave , and another ballot at a county satellite voting location in des moines , according to a des moines police report its the first time in 12 years that polk county auditor jamie fitzgerald can remember ever having to report potential voter fraud , he said thursday morning the other two suspects are accused of casting mail in ballots and also voting in person , according to police reports as of friday morning , neither of those suspects had been arrested the case is under investigation by des moines police i think it shows that our voting system works in iowa , that were able to catch it , fitzgerald said tensions are running high on both sides as election day approaches , the county auditor said , but the cases of double voting could also have been simple mistakes thats not for me to decide , he said rote was held in jail on a 5 , 000 bond , but she had been released as of friday afternoon her next court appearance was scheduled for nov 7 , court records show trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that voter fraud is rampant throughout the electorate , and especially in largely black precincts of philadelphia and chicago it is not the businessman has also suggested that he would not mind voter fraud perpetrated in his favor , saying at a rally last week , well , if theyre gonna vote for me , well think about it , right \? voter intimidation fears follow trump 's call for 'volunteer election

a melbourne cinema has cancelled a screening of a documentary on mens rights activism for fear it could be potentially damaging to our credibility following online uproar the red pill , a documentary by film maker cassie jaye , was due to screen at palace cinemas kino cinema on sunday 6 november , at an event organised by mens rights melbourne the film professes to take a balanced approach to the mens rights movement , documenting jayes life altering journey where she would never see the world the same way again but it has faced backlash from members of the feminist community and has been criticised as unbalanced and in favour of mens rights groups the australian premiere was cancelled on wednesday , after an online petition calling on the cinema to abandon the misogynistic propaganda film eclipsed 2 , 000 signatures susie smith , who founded the petition on change org , said the film gave a platform to views similar to those of daryush roosh v valizadeh , a self described neo masculinist whose planned visit to australia caused a stir with immigration in february this is the kind of disgusting , violent message that is totally out of line with australian values and law , smith wrote daryush 'roosh v' valizadeh cancels neo masculinist meetings over safety read moreplease do not associate your cinema with the kind of people who teach men how to violate women physically and emotionally please stand with the women everywhere , and do not promote misogynistic hate the petition was directly referenced by kino cinema in its email to notify david williams , the event organiser and a spokesman for mens rights melbourne , that the screening had been cancelled guardian australia has contacted williams for comment williams pasted the email above a rival petition on change org , set up to stop extremists censoring what australians are allowed to see at time of writing it had more than 5 , 000 signatures in the email , the representative of kino cinema told williams that much of the feedback to the screening of the red pill assumed that it was a curatorial decision which is potentially damaging to our credibility as we are yet to see the film so cannot stand by its contents in the face of the criticism we are receiving a spokeswoman for palace cinemas confirmed that the email pasted by williams was sent by staff at kino cinema benjamin zeccola , chief executive of palace cinemas , told guardian australia on thursday that the decision to cancel the screening was made in the absence of any judgement of the film , filmmakers or attendees however , what was initially booked as a closed , private screening was being publicised widely and this in turn upset a significant proportion of our customers , who communicated their feelings to us directly upon receiving such direct feedback we realised that irrespective of the content , its presence in one of our cinemas was offensive to a large section of our core audience and movie club members therefore we took the decision to cancel the screening aware that regardless of the decision we took , a significant number of people would be disgruntled so we took the decision that we think was best for our customer base at that time jaye rallied against the decision on social media , and called for one melbourne movie theatre to defend free speech and host the screening the numbers are on our side , people want to see the red pill , so why arent any australian movie theatres wiling to stand up to censorship \? she wrote williams told the herald sun he was determined to find a new venue to screen her film cassie jaye \( cassie jaye \) it 's confirmed palace cinemas has pulled the red pill , a film they have not even seen ! read their letter here https t co ukarlj7s2xoctober 25 , 2016cassie jaye \( cassie jaye \) 2 , 370 uninformed protestors bullied a melbourne theater into censoring redpillmovie , but 4 , 700 have signed wanting to save the red pill ! october 26 , 2016cassie jaye \( cassie jaye \) just need one melbourne theater to defend free speech and screen redpillmovie , but they 're all saying they do n't want to invite controversyoctober 26 , 2016jaye told guardian australia she was very disappointed that a petition filled with lies raised the response it did , and that kino cinema had decided to cave to these bullies demands rather than stand up for whats right im still hopeful that the red pill will find a courageous australian cinema to support a screening of the documentary , and if that happens i believe that theatre will receive a lot of praise and support from the general public for standing up for free speech pointing to her portfolio of work , she said she was a supporter of womens rights and gay rights i am not a mens rights activist , even after making the red pill , but i do believe in having an open dialogue about gender equality and thats what my film is about , she said she told the website breitbart last year that she had struggled to find executive producers who were prepared to work on a balanced film about the mens rights movement we found people who wanted to make a feminist film though the film eventually raised more than us 211 , 000 on kickstarter , its release has been plagued with controversy , much centring around one of its central subjects paul elam , the founder of the mens rights website a voice for men , which has published some deliberately inflammatory articles on domestic violence , feminism and rape you see , i find you , as a feminist , to be a loathsome , vile piece of human garbage , reads one of his posts on the site i find you so pernicious and repugnant that the idea of fucking your shit up gives me an erection alan scherstuhl referenced elams writings in his review of the documentary for the village voice the red pill , he noted , was screened in theatres mostly so that outlets like this one get tricked into running reviews that , even if negative , confer some kind of legitimacy i apologise for taking the bait , he added david futrelle , a chicago blogger who tracks and mocks the mens rights movement on his website we hunted the mammoth , on tuesday updated his scathing open letter to cassie jaye published last year , to ask readers not to campaign against screenings of the red pill its just free publicity for them , he said jaye has has accused futrelle of sending her bullying emails , and told guardian australia he was a radical feminist troll blogger who has been discredited a countless number of times but futrelle wrote on tuesday that petitions against the red pill gave jaye and mens rights activists the opportunity to play the part of free speech martyrs its exactly what they want , he wrote so please dont petitions against the red pill , dont petitions against the red pill dont petitions against the red pill let it sink into the obscurity it deserves on its own guardian australia also apologises for taking the bait topicsmoviesdocumentarynewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

no , never mind , theres nobody on base to move up in any case , he strikes out badly on a unchecked swing on a 2 2 count not so smooth right \? right \? okay im getting a tad loopy here cubs 0 3 indians , bottom 8thwell the good news for chicago is that millers probably not going to be available to for for more than an inning in game 2 thats not nothing it feels like francona might have leaned too heavily on his best pitcher , but he knows the old teams that win game 1 of the world series factoid cubs 0 3 indians , top 8thschwarber gets ahead 2 1 millers next pitch schwarber swings for the fences and comes up empty 2 2 and on the very next pitchschwarber strikes out ! miller leaves the mound to a huge ovation cubs 0 3 indians , top 8thzobrist with a sharp single , bryant is at third the tying run is up to the plate once again chicago hasnt stopped fighting , you have to admire that cubs 0 3 indians , top 8thrizzo is up miller gets ahead of him 1 2 the crowd starts to get loud again every two strike count with miller is an event millers next pitch is a ball 2 2 rizzo fouls off the next pitch still 2 2 millers next pitch , a slider just off the plate , gets called for a ball the crowd doesnt like it , but it did break rizzo swings at the next pitch but he doesnt quite get a good swing at it and it ends up just being a wind wavering flyout that davis eventually tracks down millers thrown 38 pitches already cubs 0 3 indians , top 8thbryant works a full count against miller , getting him to throw as many pitches as possible might be the best long term strategy for the cubs at this point and he takes ball four cubs 0 3 indians , top 8thmiller is back out , for his last inning one would assume cody allen is up in the cleveland bullpen he gets fowler to line out andrew m to len dnobody is feeling good about a team called the indians winning in 2016 , hopefully their own fans are even a little bit guiltytheres definitely a conversation to be had about the indians name , one that i imagine will only be amplified over the course of the serious it should be had , in my opinion cubs 0 3 indians , bottom 7thmaddon keeps grimm in the game to face napoli grimm falls behind 2 0 before getting a strike call on a nifty curveball 2 1 he throws another curve and gets napoli to ground out cubs 0 3 indians , bottom 7thif joe maddon were the producer of bewitched there would have been 300 darrens on that show right now we have justin grimm , who i remember as sucking pretty bad lindor confirms my memory by hitting a rocketing double off of him cubs 0 3 indians , bottom 7thlhp travis wood is in to face kipnis with one out and nobody on he induces a groundout and heres maddon once again what did i tell you \? email from len d after the top of the 7th header my feelings as a cub fanbody of message well shit cubs 0 3 indians , bottom 7thand the maddening maddoning has begun strop gets davis to pop out to second and maddon brings out a new reliever were going to somehow see the entire cubs bullpen over the next 2 innings oh and contreras is doing the catching now and albert almora jr is in right andrew miller might be the only player who was both with the yankees and the red sox that fans of both teams still like equally cubs 0 3 indians , top 7thdavid ross is up with a chance for a storybook moment and he gets a 3 1 count with the bases loaded he takes the next pitch and thats a 3 2 count now this is the biggest pitch of the game right here ross attempts to check his swing on strike three and he cant ! thats two straight strikeouts from miller \( what did i tell you \? \) and the cubs load the bases with nobody out and cant push a run home that feels like the game \( but please keep reading \) cubs 0 3 indians , top 7thrussell strikes out on three pitches the cubs cant score on an out now cubs 0 3 indians , top 7thwilson contreras is up , pinch hitting for coghlan he flies out but its not enough to score the runner from third thats one out miller is two strikeouts or one double play away of getting out of the jam \( the first option is more likely with miller \) cubs 0 3 indians , top 7thbaez is up next with two hitters on and nobody out he immediately falls behind 0 2 baez swings and fouls off the next pitch it really looks like hes lunging and youd think miller would be able to exploit that and put him away here rather easily instead baez lines a single and the bases are loaded and nobody out wow did this games dynamic just change dramatically in the span of a few batters cubs 0 3 indians , top 7thlefthander andrew miller , who has been frighteningly unhittable throughout this postseason , is up to face schwarber what a welcome back to the major leagues this has to be , from kluber to miller schwarber actually works a full count here , which should be as good as a solid base hit and in fact , he takes a walk on ball four the tying run is now at the plate den s has immediately transported me into a marx brothers routine with this email and i honestly am completely down with it what is difficult about saying pedro strop is the first reliever to play in this world series \? cubs 0 3 indians , top 7themail from andrew m do you really think kluber will play 3 times this series \? try and do a madbum and make a long relief outing \? if so do you think hell be as effectiveits possible , honestly part of the reason miller is warming up here is that francona would like to use kluber on short rest for a potential game 4 but he is back to start the top of the 7th where he immediately allows zobrist to hit a a single and thats the end of klubers night here comes andrew miller cubs 0 3 indians , bottom 6thits pedro strop time in cleveland , the rhp ends up being the first reliever used in this world series , which is something not everybody can say hes going to be facing perez who he strikes out gotta say he did the job cubs 0 3 indians , bottom 6thchisenhall flies out to left and that will do it for lesters inning maddon is taking him out were into the bullpens , everybody cubs 0 3 indians , bottom 6this guyer going to be bunting with a runner on second with nobody out \? he might not get a chance , he takes two balls meanwhile there is stirring in the chicago bullpen lester might not be long here it might depend on this at bat lester throws a strike 2 1 guyer swings away at the next pitch 2 2 this at bat has taken a turn dont think hes bunting now guyer takes a pitch on the corner for a strike cubs 0 3 indians , bottom 6thlesters back up he hasnt been terrible , its really just that first inning where he came close to unraveling why do i keep saying things like that ramirez hits a leadoff double off of him the second i finish that sentence dan haren \( ithrow88 \) two years ago i beat corey kluber 1 0 today , i walked my 2 pugs while wearing a pug life t shirt life comes at you fast october 26 , 2016 cubs 0 3 indians , top 6thrizzo is up , to see if he can do anything on 1 1 he swings wildly at a pitch like hes not even sure it occupies the same dimension as he does on 1 2 kluber doesnt get the call 2 2 , rizzo pops up and thats it for kluber this inning and maybe for this game \? miller has been throwing with purpose it would be unorthodox to pull kluber the way hes been pitching but , well , franconas been unorthodox with his bullpen use all postseason long cubs 0 3 indians , top 6thheres bryant who falls behind 0 2 hes a real good hitter too , it feels necessary to point that out kluber throws a ball and then gets bryant to swing on a breaking ball that he just pops up thats out two

president , bashar al assad , to step down , playing down a long held goal of us policy trump questioned how his democratic opponent would negotiate with russias president vladimir putin after having demonized him blamed barack obama for a downturn in us relations with the philippines under its new president , rodrigo duterte bemoaned a lack of republican unity behind his candidacy and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders supported him if we had party unity , we couldnt lose this election to hillary clinton , trump said as they go to the polls in a historic

argument tonight over lingering questions regarding donald trumps treatment of women and how it might affect him in the coming presidential election , with gingrich accusing kelly of bias against trump and kelly urging gingrich to take your anger issues and spend some time working on them im sick and tired of people like you using language thats inflammatory thats not true ! gingrich shouted i think that is exactly the bias that people are upset by ! i think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes , sir , kelly deadpanned what i said is , if donald trump is a sexual predator , then its a big story what we saw on that tape was trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will , kelly continued , referring to a 2005 tape that showed trump bragging about being able to sexually assault women with impunity because of his fame then we saw ten women come forward after he actually denied doing it at a debate , to say that was untrue , he did it to me he did it to me he did it to me we saw it with reporters , people who had worked with him , people from apprentice , and so on and so forth he denies it it all , which is his right we dont know what the truth is my point to you is , as a media story , we dont get to say the ten women are lying , kelly continued we have to cover that story , sir gingrich dismissed kellys assertion , and decried the amount of focus paid on trumps sexual assault accusations you are fascinated with sex , and you dont care about public policy ! gingrich responded and thats what i get out of watching you tonight im not fascinated by sex , but i am fascinated by protection of women and understanding what were getting in the oval office , kelly retorted its not about me its about the women and men of america , and the poll numbers show us that the women of america , in particular , are very concerned about these allegations the former speaker of the house of representatives responded by daring kelly to call former president bill clinton a sexual predator , which kelly ignored were gonna have to leave it at that , and you can take your anger issues and spend some time
