in the run up to the presidential election new york city was hardly trump territory and every time michael ricatto put another display of trump campaign signs up on the lawn of his sizable white house on abingdon road in kew gardens queens last summer they were stolen or knocked down actions that would later set off a series of events as unpredictable as the election itself infuriated by the thefts as well as an obscenity about donald j trump that had been spray painted on the public mailbox in front of his house mr ricatto installed a security camera it captured a grainy image of a sign stealer mr ricatto and a real estate investor then printed fliers bearing the image and a reward offer for information leading to the arrest of the sign thief he hired some local teenagers to post the signs around the neighborhood with tape when the tape ran out he said the teenagers used a stapler to post the fliers to trees on the streets the hubbub made the news and the stapling method was mentioned in the weeks that followed a team of enforcement officers from the parks department arrived at mr ricattos house he said and issued him summonses with fines totaling and citing unauthorized posting and minor tree damage to trees to mr ricatto his real transgression was supporting mr trump a republican which he claims annoyed democratic city officials lets call it staple gate said mr ricatto who calls himself a conservative a proud gun owner and a fan of ronald reagan and john wayne a supporter of mr trumps democratic opponent hillary clinton would never have been cited in this situation he fumed and said that official parks department signs are often affixed to trees with similar staples people in new york city dont like conservatives he said they wanted to teach me a lesson about being outspoken and about who i believe in so they found something to hang their hat on mr ricatto said he paid the summonses because i didnt want the headache of fighting them nor the expense of hiring a lawyer instead of backing down he splurged on a larger trump banner to hang in front of his house and he called the prominent civil rights lawyer ron kuby to see if he had any grounds to sue the city for damages claiming political bias in an interview mr kuby said that he thought the summons was a wild overreaction by the city but that a suit by mr ricatto claiming selective enforcement based on his trump leanings would be difficult case to make a parks department spokesman dismissed the claim that the summonses were political and called them a routine penalty for damage to the trees the fine had nothing to do with the content of the signs mr ricatto posted and everything to do with the fact that staples can damage and even kill trees the spokesman sam biederman said in a statement he added that the fine was determined by the citys administrative court and not based on the amount of damage or the cost associated but rather on the rule broken the order to cite mr ricatto set off something of a parallel episode within the parks department an enforcement supervisor ordered a sergeant to write the tickets but the sergeant joe oro refused arguing that it was improper to write summonses weeks after the signs had been removed with no witnesses to the violations they were bogus summonses said sergeant oro a veteran with years on the job i might as well hit every dog owner who puts up a lost puppy sign he said he also consulted a superior officer and he told me stay out of it its too political a rookie officer wound up writing the summons said sergeant oro who has had previous run ins with the agency as an outspoken member of his union local of dc the locals president joe puleo characterized department officials as using the officers as pawns for their political favoritism in this case sergeant oro said he was included in an email conversation about possibly forcing mr ricatto to pay in damage for the staple holes a proposition that an agency lawyer replied to incredulously in the email chain as for mr ricatto president elect trumps victory is a bit of revenge last week he bought and hung a new larger banner i told you so the banner reads trump trump trump trump
an email i received from a reader some time ago has begun to haunt me the readers sister was dying of cancer how she asked me would i respond to the word grace in the context of a cancer death my correspondent did not gloss over the miseries of her sisters terminal state she outlined a series of horrific tests that led doctors to withhold food she described fevers infections and the weeping legs caused by edema but then she testified to her sisters uncanny ability to brighten any room with her smiles had i received this query while i was undergoing my first treatments it would have triggered irritation bordering on apoplexy why should a cancer patient be expected to lift her own spirits or anyone elses isnt it hard enough dealing with such dire circumstances without having to become a booster for oneself and for caregivers one scholar of american cancer culture samantha king decries a tyranny of cheerfulness that gets too many patients down making us feel guilty about expressing understandable anguish during the intervening years however i have interacted with friends as they confronted an irreversible condition and i too have witnessed a kind of grace that i found inspiring while coping with cancer these people contested it and sometimes the medical protocols upon which they had to rely yet when bodily functions shut down few of them dug in and battled a condition pronounced terminal indeed their sense of tranquillity seemed to be founded on acceptance of their impending mortality what might have contributed to their patent and patient grace and given my own impatience with circumstances beyond my control could i possibly tap such sources catholic and protestant authorities agree on the mysterious nature of grace which they see as a free and undeserved or gratuitous favor not a reward a disposition that works to perfect the soul grace cannot be known or acquired through words beliefs or deeds in the jewish tradition the hebrew word chen for grace appears in the benediction may the lord be gracious to you though the word baruch for blessed is used more frequently to denote an unmerited gift for believers who seek this benefit from god as for nonbelievers who seek it elsewhere grace remains a highly elusive but highly desirable state especially in troubled times people with cancer explore all the activities that people without cancer use to make themselves receptive to a sense of beneficence or loving kindness religious liturgies private prayer meditation breathing and body exercises verse or mantra recitations making or looking at pictures listening to or making music walking in nature communing with friends and alcohol or marijuana those engaged daily in one or more of these practices testify to their efficacy a zillion self help books offer instructions but the trick must consist in finding ones own eccentric way my correspondent had glimpsed grace in her sisters smiles shed also found it in an obituary that a massachusetts mother beth orourke had composed for herself while she was dying of cancer and she included a link to it the self obituarys eerie opening i died thursday april prefaces a description of ms orourkes life and then her conclusion that in the end grace and love win not cancer it reminded me of the first self obituary i had read after a recurrence of endometrial cancer the seattle based author and editor jane catherine lotter posted an essay in which she recalled the high points of her education and career because she wanted to be joyful about having a full life rather than sad about having to die she closed with thanks for her family and ended with beautiful day happy to have been here might the introspection and retrospection of writing serve as one source of grace that transforms it from a gift received to a gift conferred after my friend pep died of metastatic colon cancer his self obit in the local paper brought tears to my eyes it was as if i heard his jokey self deprecating voice from beyond the grave the act of composition must have composed him providing an opportunity to reflect on his life to express appreciation of his family and friends and to make peace with the posthumous presence he would become in common parlance the word grace means elegance ease of comportment a style that charms those who observe it a scholar of many languages pep would have known that it derives from the latin gratus which mean pleasing or thankful and that it gave rise to the italian grazie and the spanish gracias by virtue of his gracious words pep bestowed a gift of grace on his family and friends i cannot imagine attaining a durable state of grace throughout the ordeals that will surely arrive in the future instead i consider practicing a series of hesitant brief grace notes the musical notation of these short notes is printed in smaller type to indicate an ornament and with a slur mark linking them to the note they precede a fleeting sound before a longer lasting duration that immediately follows to me they look buoyant like a tiny bounce or skip forward there must be as many ways to play grace notes as there are people in the world what might they be i wonder in this season i give thanks for the time that remains to resist animosity and fear i want to devote it to becoming proficient at all sorts of grace notes before the chords of closure resound into silence
in his early years as a prosecutor robert m morgenthau was once asked about the most effective way to fight organized crime at the time mr morgenthau had made a name for himself as a united states attorney by indicting more than mafia figures mr morgenthau raised a novel strategy maybe we ought to declare a moratorium on the prosecution of organized crime for five to years he told victor s navasky for a new york times magazine article in and let them become so rich that they will give up their predatory instincts and theyll be much more concerned about getting their children into college law school medical school and so forth and theyll have lost their desire he never did declare that moratorium his years of doing battle with crime in all forms were just beginning mr morgenthau now and still working five days a week was the district attorney for manhattan from until he retired at age in during which time crime in new york was completely transformed and the city with it there were murders in manhattan the year he took office when he left there were it was the kind of transformation no one at the time could have imagined rapes assaults robberies and property crimes similarly fell sharply streets parks and whole neighborhoods were reinvented people who were dedicated to killing one another found other ways to settle their disputes on a recent lunch hour in his office at the firm wachtell lipton rosen katz mr morgenthau was at a loss to explain just how it had all happened my theory was prompt and certain arrest prosecution and punishment he said if you commit a crime the chances of you being arrested were pretty good and youd be prosecuted promptly i didnt believe in long sentences crime came down all over but it came down much more in manhattan than any other place in the city or state we went from being the no borough for murders to no i never claimed credit for the drop in crime because i thought if crime goes back up they can blame me so i never stuck my neck out his office in midtown manhattan where he has worked since faintly echoed the clutter of his former workplace with stacks of papers covering the desk and shelves and no computer in sight the lunch was no nonsense sandwiches and salads he recalled a night from his first months on the job when he sat in a surveillance van on the lower east side of manhattan and watched dealers sell drugs openly as a uniformed patrolman stood idly by people were getting away with it he said and the police department wasnt really looking at any murders north of street that was where it was walled off a severed head was found on edgecombe avenue in the nobody was investigating to see who it was or what happened it wasnt news it wasnt important the numbers from his tenure are staggering mr morgenthau a democrat oversaw by his count million cases and he won nine elections and served under five mayors beame koch dinkins giuliani bloomberg he hired assistant district attorneys andrew m cuomo sonia sotomayor eliot spitzer john f kennedy jr cyrus r vance jr more than of his prosecutors went on to be judges for better or worse mr morgenthau said he brought cases against international drug cartels money launderers the murderer of john lennon the preppy killer robert chambers and the son who swindled millions from brooke astor he was the boss in a cardigan sweater with a gruff mouth and sometimes mismatched socks his prosecutors won hundreds of millions in settlements and judgments against white collar criminals including l dennis kozlowski the former chief executive of tyco international whose ill gotten luxuries included a shower curtain they also wrongfully prosecuted five young african american and latino men for the rape and beating of a jogger in central park he was remarkably tenacious said jeremy travis president of john jay college of criminal justice who was also a mayoral adviser and deputy commissioner of legal matters for the police department during parts of mr morgenthaus tenure he had a reputation for integrity making tough calls and putting his name and reputation on the line in most elections he ran uncontested mr morgenthau became the model for the first district attorney on law order played by steven hill who the real district attorney thought was pretty good i was mad at him mr morgenthau said because he came down to see me and i had lunch with him and i told him if you ever decide to retire let me know in advance cause the report was he was getting an episode i was half serious anyway he resigned without telling me when mr morgenthau in turn left office he told reporters he did not know what he would do next but he was not ready to hang it up i got an email from my older brother who said this is a bad time to be looking for a job he said robert morris morgenthau was born in into a family that rose to great public influence through public service his grandfather henry morgenthau was president woodrow wilsons ambassador to turkey where he unsuccessfully urged the united states to intervene in the turkish slaughter of armenians his father henry morgenthau jr was treasury secretary under his friend president franklin d roosevelt and persuaded the reluctant administration to intercede belatedly in the nazi slaughter of europes jews robert the second of three children grew up on the upper west side of manhattan and in upstate new york among the kennedys and the roosevelts i used to cook for mrs roosevelt he said volunteering a story he has told before we have some pictures of me cooking hot dogs for the queen but the most exciting thing for me was when f d r brought churchill down
after months of wrangling with reporters and in court over the disclosure of emails the administration of mayor bill de blasio on wednesday released a third batch of its correspondence with outside advisers that it has designated as agents of the city the emails released in response to a freedom of information law request totaled more than pages and date to the first days of mr de blasios tenure in early through april they reveal a city hall in regular contact with public relations firms over the minutia of press strategy whether to remove a fence to make a better backdrop for an event in harlem a lengthy discussion of how to discredit rival cities in a bid to host the democratic national convention in brooklyn whether to solicit a politician to speak with a reporter a little worried that he will unintentionally go off message jonathan rosen a principal at the public relations firm berlinrosen said in a february email of sheldon silver the democratic speaker of the new york state assembly at the time he is somewhat constitutionally unable not to screw up that kind of thing but not present except in brief snippets is the voice of mr de blasio a democrat his emails often marked simply as b are largely redacted so too are some from his closest outside advisers who city lawyers have said are city agents a group that includes mr rosen bill hyers and nicholas baldick of hilltop public solutions a political consulting firm john del cecato a speechwriter at akpd message and media and patrick gaspard the united states ambassador to south africa and a longtime friend of mr de blasio the city argues in court and in its response to freedom of information requests that the designation also applies to dozens of others who work for their firms correspondence is at the heart of a fight between reporters and the de blasio administration which maintains that the emails with outside advisers are in effect the same as those within a city agency and are therefore exempt from public disclosure under the states freedom of information law a court case begun by the new york post and seeking to unveil those emails is pending government watchdog groups have raised concerns that the advisers act as a shadow government and present concerns about conflicts of interest because they also represent companies that do business with the city the release on wednesday was the third disclosure by city hall in connection with the emails previous releases have contained emails to city officials from the advisers on behalf of their clients weve carefully re reviewed all of the documents and have expanded our disclosure to make sure that we havent missed anything eric f phillips the mayors press secretary said in an email mr phillips said that the redactions were determined by the citys law department and covered only those portions of the emails containing private information like cellphone numbers or email addresses or inter intra agency deliberative content a category that includes deliberative commentary on news articles while the emails do not provide new information related to the state and federal investigations into mr de blasios fund raising they shed light on the details of assembling favorable commentary from those who are aligned with the mayors causes or have donated money to him one email contained a list of hundreds of official validators people who could be counted on for a good quote heres who i am shooting for ross offinger a fund raiser for the mayor wrote on january about providing a list of prominent real estate and business leaders the list included donors and bundlers for mr de blasio whom the mayor was going to contact in connection with the his universal prekindergarten program the email went to the first deputy mayor anthony e shorris two top aides and mr rosen can we take this off official thread please one of the aides peter ragone replied mr ragone mr rosen and mr del cecato declined to comment on the emails other advisers could not immediately be reached for comment on wednesday night

if youre in the retail business in the united states you probably really care about these two things millennials and black friday but more and more these two big drivers of the industry dont mix inside stores a dynamic that is reshaping one of the countrys biggest shopping days young people of all kinds a coveted group for retailers because of their free spending ways are increasingly turning to their computers and phones to do their holiday shopping spreading out more widely the days they open their wallets crowds on friday the unofficial kickoff of the holiday shopping season will tilt older than a few years ago and also it appears more cautious with their money as a result the mix of retailers with high expectations for the day is changing quickly skewing more toward dollar stores and discount retailers and toward essential products like food and cookware and it is also making the day itself less and less important for the industry over all as big as the event or the weekend has become its substantially muted for the fact that all of the people are buying online said mark a cohen director of retail studies at columbia business school a decade ago the day after thanksgiving accounted for percent of all shopping for the holiday season according to craig johnson the president of customer growth partners a research firm this year he expects shoppers to spend billion on black friday but that will account for only percent of the spending this season over all people are expected to spend billion this holiday season up from billion last year the company estimates but for the first time more than half that growth will come from online shopping mr johnson said at the same time there is a distinct division in who is shopping online more than half of baby boomers surveyed said they would do none of their holiday shopping online according to a study by civicscience a market research company nearly percent of those age to the group known as millennials will do most or all of their shopping on the web and another percent said they would shop both online and in store that shift to online shopping has put more pressure on stores to offer deals good enough to bring people out into the cold less than a quarter of americans plan to shop in stores on black friday down from percent two years ago according to a survey by bankrate com a website that tracks savings products televisions headphones and electronics as always are expected to be a big draw at big box stores like walmart and target department stores that offer big discounts like macys will remain a top destination during the weekend too macys website is blanketed with its black friday promotions with ads for everything from coats to apple watches to blenders black friday starts now declares a big banner at the top but discount and dollar stores which generally havent been big draws on black friday are also expecting strong sales over all dollar stores will experience one of the biggest rises in turnout this year over last year according to a survey of more than adults by the data company nielsen phillip dengler the co owner of the website bestblackfriday com which monitors the annual sales said he had seen more of a push from low budget stores this year he pointed to the discount chain dollar general as an example the company has extended its hours and mr dengler said the chain had made more of an effort to get its black friday circulars online and in front of customers when you think about black friday you dont think about dollar general you think about walmart and target and amazon mr dengler said theyre trying a little bit more discounters like dollar stores and so called off price stores like t j maxx and ross also are different in another way from rival retailers they have little to no e commerce presence that has made them somewhat immune to certain industry pressures and could give them greater incentive to entice people into stores i think e commerce has allowed for black friday to start whenever amazon wants it to start said simeon siegel an analyst with nomura for the last few years amazon has offered prime day its own annual one day shopping bonanza that doesnt exist for t j and ross another trend working in favor of discount and dollar stores is the rising popularity of food and kitchen items like mixers and cookware as holiday gifts thats in part because of new fads like friendsgiving and friendsmas when you guessed it friends rather than family get together for a holiday meal as a result food is going to be more central to the holidays than ever before said jordan rost vice president for consumer insights at nielsen in an email walmart for example said it would offer some specials on kitchen appliances for under as well as deals on nonstick cooking sets and griddles for the foodies interested in opening their wallets a little more there are also plenty of pricier options both online and in the stores harry david the maker of gift baskets is offering black friday deals on its arrangements of cheeses and fruits neiman marcuss notoriously opulent holiday offerings included collard greens for before they sold out more generally though stores at the higher end of the income spectrum like neiman marcus and bloomingdales for instance have continued to more quietly promote their black friday sales i think the low end consumer is still looking for the best deal but i think the higher end consumers are looking for the best products and the best services said liz dunn the founder and chief executive of talmage advisors a consumer and retailing consulting firm i think its been a consistent theme for many many years she said that these high end stores dont necessarily
donald j trump sat down on tuesday with reporters editors and columnists of the new york times for an exclusive interview times reporters have annotated portions of the interview the full transcript is available here the personal interactions between president obama and mr trump have so far been pleasant but its not clear that the kumbaya moment will last mr obama has already indicated that he may weigh in against mr trump once the new administration takes over especially if the new president attacks mr obamas legacy achievements here is our story on the cordial minute meeting between mr trump and mr obama in the oval office mr trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming office starting with this meeting at what he branded the failing new york times during his presidential campaign but he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and the times in particular here is more about mr trumps relationships with the news media and the times mr trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business empire he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance but he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it this story has more about mr trumps business ties mr trump is correct that federal law for the most part exempts the president from conflict of interest rules meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings but in modern times most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts mr trump has said he does not intend to take such a step instead will turn his companies over to his children read this story for more on mr trumps potential conflicts of interest the wall street journal editorial board among others has suggested that the only solution to mr trumps potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his assets and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds mr trump suggests that this is not practical mr trumps crowds at rallies frequently targeted hillary clinton chanting lock her up and referring to her as a criminal in july mr trump himself encouraged a crowd in colorado telling them im starting to agree with you as they chanted lock her up in addition despite mr trumps remarks here the f b i and the justice department which have investigated mrs clintons email server and the clinton foundation conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the white house a president attempting to intervene in those kinds of inquiries in any direction would be a major scandal here is our full story about mr trumps reversal on prosecuting mrs clinton mr trump has been criticized for not specifically denouncing bigotry and groups that spread bigoted views his statements about such conduct tend to be vague including here when he says i disavow the group that nonspecific language has been comforting to leaders of the alt right a rebranded white nationalist movement including richard b spencer who led a gathering at a federal building near the white house last weekend that included some audience members offering a nazi salute mr trump here acknowledges perhaps for the first time that being president will perhaps help enrich his family he also concedes that the arrangement might fairly be called a conflict of interest back in february when he was still a candidate mr trump said definitively that torture was effective dont tell me it doesnt work torture works he told an audience in south carolina o k folks torture you know half these guys torture doesnt work believe me it works o k so mr trumps answer on tuesday offered a revealing insight into his willingness to shift or rethink a position especially after talking with someone he respects gen james n mattis may well be mr trumps secretary of defense and his rejection of torture clearly had an effect on the president elect the reality is more complicated the number of factories and the number of americans who work in factories both have declined sharply in recent decades but the nations manufacturing output is at the highest level in history the labor intensive production of low value goods like socks has been replaced by the largely automated production of high value goods like circuits in president ronald reagan signed a landmark law that prohibited the hiring of illegal immigrants provided new resources for enforcement along the mexican border and offered legal status to several million illegal immigrants experts say the law did little to slow migration to the united states but made crossing the border more difficult and dangerous premiums for many health plans under the affordable care act are increasing percent to percent or more but increases of percent are extremely rare deductibles for many plans are high but not for a family plan in the maximum out of pocket cost including the deductible is mr trumps comments about his fellow republicans had a sharp edge and an implicit message they owe their congressional majority to him and he expects to be treated accordingly whether this is true and to what extent will be one of the pivotal stories of the new trump administration and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done he needs congress to achieve many of the campaign promises he made including the deep tax cut and large infrastructure spending package not to mention and it is an open question how in love with his policies republicans will prove to be read these stories for background on mr trumps relationships with republican leaders in congress and the never trump stalwarts who are pondering the future of the conservative movement mr trump suggests here that he may name jared kushner his son
for thanksgiving this year many americans are anticipating turkey mashed potatoes pumpkin pie and postelection combat with relatives every election provokes some level of stress among voters but mental health professionals say that the polarization of this years presidential race appeared to have amplified the tension it was a very significant stressor for people this year said dr vaile wright director of research and special projects at the american psychological association on tuesday we asked readers to tell us whether they expected their thanksgiving gatherings to provide a stage for potential blowups as seldom seen relatives congregate for the first time since election day several people wrote to say they planned to adhere to a no political talk rule others said they were taking a more extreme approach avoiding thanksgiving get togethers altogether for those disappointed by the presidential outcome much of the anxiety stemmed from concerns that relatives who supported donald j trump might gloat about his victory vince garcia said he heard rumblings that two relatives were planning to wear trump gear at their thanksgiving gathering quite honestly im not looking forward to it at all he wrote in an email martin johnson a retired engineer in san clemente said he and his wife worried that sparks could fly during their gathering of family members about half are loyal democrats he said and half dedicated trump supporters if things get out of hand mr johnson said he planned to tell his guests just put all that stuff in a shoe box and put it on a shelf lets just not get into that topic dr wright said avoiding politics was sometimes the right approach if the election outcome is weighing heavily on your mind thanksgiving can be a time to talk about it she said but if reconnecting with family is whats most important it could be wise to just postpone the political talk for another time kathy winter a reader in san diego wrote in with a reminder that thanksgiving is intended to be a moment to count blessings and connect with family but she added if we are all mature adults we should be able to talk politics the salinas valley known as the salad

san francisco to suggest a dish that takes advantage of the fall season she offered this one from a book she wrote with nicolaus balla bar tartine techniques recipes winner of a james beard award potato and green bean soup this is a soup to make in late summer or autumn when the days get shorter and the green beans grow big and tough it is ideal for those end of season beans which are much better cooked well past the bright green and crisp stage that culinary professionals prize in this soup the beans are cooked grandmother style until they are quite tender and develop a deep earthy

if you think back to this years presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning hillary clintons email troubles and donald j trumps various controversies you wouldnt be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about jobs the economy and taxes thats because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is strong but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate personality campaign strategy and assessments of whos winning instead of on policies and ideas but this year the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific topics candidate traits or characteristics and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the candidates fitness for office than they did the nations economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson hexagon i categorized the campaign news coverage of media outlets this consisted of four broadcast networks three cable news networks national public radio and hugh hewitt on the radio two online news sites and newspapers i specifically searched for news about mrs clintons campaign and her email server or her campaign and wikileaks and several controversies connected to mr trumps campaign i also looked for news about the candidates campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list isnt exhaustive but it gives a sense of the trade off between coverage of these controversies and the economy the candidates controversies received more coverage on average than their views on the economy from june until election day percent of the stories mentioned mr trumps various missteps and percent mentioned mrs clintons email only percent mentioned mr trump and jobs or the economy and only percent cited mrs clintons campaign and the economy closer to the election from oct on the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the access hollywood video and a few weeks before f b i director james b comeys letter to congress from this point percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss mrs clintons email while only percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for mr trump percent mention his entanglements while percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the candidates character is striking as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video release between oct and election day roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned mrs clintons emails and only a quarter discussed mr trump and his imbroglios a mere percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned mrs clinton and the economy these choices have consequences according to the gallup organization americans reports of what they heard or read about mrs clinton between june and september were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in contrast mentions of mr trump changed week by week tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news media its important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse accurately then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the candidates choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the case i used data from kantar media cmag on all the candidates campaign ads aired between june and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television mrs clinton made more ads than mr trump and she vastly out advertised him running nearly three times as many ads as he did all told over half a million ads were run in during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other persons character in fact the losing candidates ads did little else more than three quarters of the appeals in mrs clintons advertisements were about traits characteristics or dispositions only percent of mrs clintons appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by contrast percent of mr trumps appeals focused on the economy jobs taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on average traits typically garner about percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about percent of the appeals theres usually much more balance of course this was an unusual election year with two very unpopular candidates so the candidates flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the reason the criterion of fitness for office dominated the clinton campaigns messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as well and the news media covered it

in early october yurie adachi a member of the japanese womens national hockey team was preparing for a late night practice in tokyo when she met a visitor from new york adachi who does not speak much english smiled and offered a one word greeting riveters since junior high school adachi has played with nana fujimoto the japanese goaltender who competed in the inaugural season of the national womens hockey league in adachi kept track of fujimoto with the riveters the leagues new york area franchise that now plays its home games in newark canada united states are wonderful environments for hockey adachi said through an interpreter sitting in an aging rink where water from the roof leaked onto the ice the formation of the n w h l was a significant moment female hockey players in the united states would finally receive salaries as professionals the first season of operation was largely deemed a success with paid attendance the league said of per game so the n w h l s players were staggered when they were notified on thursday that their salaries would be cut to keep the league afloat this season according to the league average attendance has dropped to now with the future of the n w h l uncertain players are calling for more transparency from the league office theyve made that clear that we need to rebuild some trust dani rylan the n w h l s commissioner said on sunday during the riveters win over the connecticut whale in newark i think trust is a two way street even though it was an unfortunate set of circumstances it might end up realigning us and putting us back on that path together this season player salaries ranged from to originally some players said they were told that salaries would be cut in half but multiple sources with direct knowledge of the leagues finances confirmed the actual pay cut would be percent the reduction softened by a recent contribution by dunkin donuts meanwhile many players are troubled because they have received little information about the leagues condition there are many things since their inception that have been a state secret said brant feldman managing partner of american group management who has represented womens hockey players since if you operate something without a public image to it i get it but if youre operating a sports league of any sort you need things done in a public facing manner n w h l players in a statement released saturday through social media called for an independent audit of the leagues finances disclosure of the identity of investors and an explanation of why revenue has diminished so quickly the biggest thing is we need transparency right now riveters forward bray ketchum said of the players demands rylan said there are some things we will work with the players on there are some demands that we might not be able to but i think that we are committed to working together on sunday the leagues four teams the riveters the whale the boston pride and the buffalo beauts played for the first time since the salary cuts getting back on the ice had the effect of cooling emotions some players had contemplated walking away from the league rather than accept its new circumstances i can understand how much it hurts them and if they feel a bit betrayed and they cant trust this league right now pride forward rachel llanes said the league has a players association but there is no collective bargaining agreement christopher fusco managing partner of the law firm callahan and fusco has a background in sports and employment law he said he thought cutting salary without any negotiations was an unfair labor practice but without a collective bargaining agreement he added players do not have much recourse unless they are willing to walk out opt out clauses were added to player contracts this season but few are likely to use them for the players a percent pay cut meant that game preparation was replaced by questions about paying rent getting out of leases or becoming eligible for unemployment benefits the riveters have been discussing ways to raise money and pitch in to help teammates under serious financial strain riveters defender kiira dosdall and other players also thought the role of the players association should be reassessed on the management side rylan said she had no doubt this season would be completed but added that attracting sponsors had been harder than expected before dunkin donuts agreed to give toward salaries players had received dunkin donuts gift cards each season tom manchester the companys vice president for field marketing in the united states said it was possible the company would provide further salary contributions although the n h l has collaborated with the n w h l there is no formal partnership between the two or with the canadian womens hockey league another womens professional league which is in its season in an email an n h l spokesman said that the league was supportive of womens hockey but that it had always questioned the viability of two professional womens leagues and the sustainability of the current business model riveters forward janine weber said everyone understood the risks involved

kara waite an english teacher at bunker hill community college in charlestown mass made a rule for herself for every political rant she posts on facebook she must pick up the phone and call a legislator its kind of a swear jar for political action ms waite said recently ms waite who volunteers for liberal causes and who created a widely shared document last week to teach others her methods figures that a phone ringing off the hook is more difficult for a lawmaker to ignore than a flooded inbox activists of all political stripes recommend calling legislators not just emailing and certainly not just venting on social media several lawmakers along with those who work for them said in interviews that ms waite is right a phone call from a constituent can indeed hold more weight than an email and far outweighs a facebook post or a tweet to understand why it helps to know what happens when someone answers the phone at a legislators office emily ellsworth whose jobs have included answering phones in the district offices of two republican representatives from utah jason chaffetz from to and chris stewart from to said the way your points reach a lawmaker depends on how many calls the office is getting at the time and how you present your story in some cases its a simple process when a caller offered an opinion staff members would write the comments down in a spreadsheet compile them each month and present reports to top officials she said if the lawmaker had already put out a statement on the issue the staff member would read it to the caller she said but a large volume of calls on an issue could bring an office to a halt sometimes spurring the legislator to put out a statement on his or her position ms ellsworth said she recommended the tactic in a series of tweets shared thousands of times it brings a legislative issue right to the top of the mind of a member she said it makes it impossible to ignore for the whole staff you dont get a whole lot else done when her branch in utah received a lot of calls she contacted the washington office and coordinated the messaging involving the communications director the legislative director or the chief of staff ms ellsworth said while scripts found on the internet can be useful for people uncomfortable talking on the phone she suggested making the phone calls as personal as possible in some cases if she was moved by a call she would pass on the comments to her district director she said what representatives and staffers want to hear is the individual impact of your individual story she said i couldnt listen to peoples stories for six to eight hours a day and not be profoundly impacted by them a new york state senator phil boyle a republican said that one of his staff members would contact him after a constituent called his office and that he would try to call everyone back thats a perk exclusive to those who call in since he sometimes gets more than emails per day he said i couldnt possibly do that for emails mr boyle said when its a subject in which he lacks expertise he said the calls have made a difference in one case several retired law enforcement officers called him about a gun control law that was enacted in worried that they would have to give up their service revolvers senator boyle who said he doesnt use firearms much was unaware of that possibility and proposed an amendment to grant them an exception gov andrew m cuomo granted the exception seven months after the law was passed most calls can be handled by staff members said brian kolb the republican minority leader in the new york state assembly many callers just want to express an opinion and dont even offer a name he said in other cases callers who want to talk out an issue more fully could be directed to a staff member who has expertise in the area said state senator liz krueger a democrat in new york ms waite who has had a calendar reminder for each monday morning alerting her to call party leadership said that first time callers often fear they will be quizzed or interrogated but that they generally just need to offer their opinion and basic personal information like name and city she implored people to be courteous since the staff members might be getting many calls communicate in a way that someone cant ignore ms waite said
your phone is pretty much a high tech bucket of germs thousands of microscopic bugs crawl around on its surface remnants of dirty old skin cells smudge its cover tiny hairs stick inside its buttons and your hands have smeared hundreds of chemicals across its surface the foundation on your face the antidepressants you take the shampoo in your shower and even the hard core mosquito repellent you applied down in panama four months ago all of these things leave traces on your hands and phone thats why scientists say they can use your phone to learn a lot about your lifestyle in a study published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences last week pieter dorrestein a biochemist at the university of california san diego and his colleagues asked can scientists or maybe one day police investigators profile a person chemically based on the objects he or she possesses they started with your phone which you touch on average about times a day in the study they swabbed the hands of people along with their phones producing hundreds of chemical samples then they used techniques from biochemistry to break down analyze and identify some of the chemicals matching them with entries in a database of crowdsourced chemical structures based on the compounds common to both hands and phones they made inferences about each persons lifestyle like whether they drank tea or coffee liked citrus fruits or spent time in the sun not every molecule is a clue said dr dorrestein but those that are enable you to build a lifestyle sketch of the particular owner or user of that object the study which was funded by the national institute of justice a research agency of the united states department of justice calls these high tech deductions molecular lifestyle signatures which could be used in criminal investigations to narrow down a subject pool when dna or fingerprint evidence doesnt yield a match some legal experts said the technique could improve upon the subjective impressions of investigators this is not different in kind from what happens all the time in criminal investigation except that it purports to do it more systematically more scientifically and potentially more reliably frederick schauer a law professor at the university of virginia who has written about profiling and stereotyping and was not involved in the study wrote in an email the suggestion is worrisome to some forensic scientists its easy to imagine the scenario playing out in a courtroom drama no match from the dna in the phone pull out the test tubes turn on the mass spectrometer cue the montage music if you watch a lot of tv and films you can think this is whats coming next said brent turvey a forensic scientist and criminal profiler but dr turvey says that exaggerating the techniques potential could take the actual science too far too soon as it has with gunshot residue analysis as gunshot residue became a greater part of investigations forensic scientists determined that it can turn up in places other than the hands of a person who fired a gun potentially creating false positives while chemical profiling could one day find its way to a crime lab for use in limited circumstances dr schauer said there was a fat chance it would ever make it into the courtroom expert evidence has to reach an extremely high standard for admission at trials which the technique may not be able to meet jonathan koehler a behavioral scientist at the northwestern university pritzker school of law worries that if this technique were to take off investigators might ignore or undervalue other leads and push courts to prematurely admit evidence based on potentially inaccurate inferences i dont smoke and am rarely around cigarette smoke but i just happened to be around someone yesterday who was smoking up a storm he said so what would detection of nicotine on my iphone really say about my lifestyle other than something really misleading dr dorrestein the studys lead author acknowledged that even if a chemical profile could narrow down a pool of suspects later proving someones identity and perhaps their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt ultimately comes down to a full investigation that means your filthy phone is more likely to reveal that you remembered your meds or sunscreen than it is to nail you in court
president elect donald j trump said on tuesday that he had no intention of pressing for an investigation into hillary clintons use of a private email server or the financial operations of her familys foundation dropping the lock her up pledge that became a rallying cry for his campaign for the white house mr trump who branded his rival crooked hillary and said she would go to jail if he were president said in an interview with reporters and editors at the new york times that he was no longer interested in pursuing mrs clinton in part because he wanted to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign i dont want to hurt the clintons i really dont mr trump said during the interview she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was vicious his reversal on prosecuting mrs clinton was particularly striking given the outsize role the issue played during the presidential campaign in which her use of a private email server as secretary of state became a prominent theme and one she has blamed for her loss to mr trump mr trump said he wanted to move forward from the subject without elaborating he said that well have people that do things perhaps a reference to the f b i or republicans who might continue to press for prosecutions in the email or foundation cases but the president elect made clear that he would not seek to pursue an investigation himself nor make it a priority after he assumes office the decision angered some of his most fervent supporters who immediately criticized his seeming change of heart broken promise blared the headline on breitbart news a conservative news site that has strongly backed mr trump its not something that i feel very strongly about mr trump said at the times unlike health care or immigration this has been a very painful period of time clinton aides did not respond to a request for comment about mr trumps remarks during their second debate mr trump turned to mrs clinton and vowed if i win i am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because theres never been so many lies so much deception after mr trumps turnaround on tuesday the conservative commentator ann coulter one of his staunchest supporters during the campaign suggested on twitter that mr trump was overstepping his role whoa i thought we elected realdonaldtrump president she wrote did we make him the fbi doj his job is to pick those guys not do their jobs tom fitton president of judicial watch a conservative advocacy group that has been a relentless critic of mrs clinton said on tuesday that it would be a mistake for mr trump to drop the threat of appointing a special counsel to look into her email use mr fitton said that although the f b i had already investigated the matter twice that inquiry was flawed his group has gained access to thousands of pages of mrs clintons state department emails through lawsuits and is pressing its case in court even after her defeat representative jason chaffetz a utah republican who leads the house oversight and government reform committee said last week on fox news that his committee would continue to investigate the matter as well because weve got to get to the truth mr chaffetzs office said on tuesday he was unavailable for comment about mr trumps statements although the f b i s email investigation is closed the agency still has an open inquiry into the clinton foundation that inquiry began after the publication of clinton cash a book by peter schweizer that asserted that some foreign entities had given money to the foundation in return for state department favors when mrs clinton was there the clintons have denied the assertions the f b i and justice department conduct their criminal investigations largely independently from the white house so mr trump cannot tell agents to close their cases a president ordering the f b i to stop a politically sensitive case would be a major scandal it does seem like an extraordinary breach of protocol for him to get involved in that decision glen a kopp a former federal prosecutor in new york said of the president elect i know of no recent circumstances when the president ordered an attorney general not to pursue a criminal matter if as president mr trump were to order the f b i director james b comey to close the foundation inquiry mr comey could choose to rebuff him f b i directors are given year terms to insulate them from political pressure but the president still has the power to fire a director as president bill clinton did with william s sessions in after a justice department investigation uncovered ethical abuses by mr sessions in an interview last week with cbs newss minutes mr trump said he had not yet decided whether to dismiss mr comey over his handling of the clinton email investigation saying the director may have had very good reasons for doing what he did as a practical matter though mr trumps remarks will probably have little impact the investigation into mrs clintons emails is already closed and while the one into her familys foundation remains open senior f b i officials and career justice department officials have said there is little evidence justifying moving forward with a case when the case comes up for review senior agents and prosecutors may decide to shut it down but it will not be because of mr trumps remarks while the president elects decision is likely to frustrate investigators at the f b i who are fiercely protective of their independence to follow the facts they uncover some legal experts applauded mr trumps decision to not pursue investigations into mrs clintons emails or her family foundation rory
this years election has forced americans to take notice of class divisions between workers and while these divisions may at first ring of lazy stereotypes the rural rust belt worker without a college degree and the coastal urban college educated worker theyre rooted in a real dynamic many of the most skilled workers young people with college degrees are leaving struggling regions of america for cities specifically for cities in southern and coastal states there are clear economic reasons for their choice dense metro areas tend to produce more jobs and make workers more productive wages for all kinds of workers are also higher in theory these incentives should prompt workers of all levels of education to move to metro areas but moving outside ones region is relatively rare these days and even more rare for someone without a college degree moving is actually quite uncommon in advanced economies the united states has been one of the exceptions it has one of the highest rates of internal migration among advanced economies and it has since at least the middle of the century a study comparing thousands of american and british census records between and showed that nearly two thirds of american men moved across county lines while only a quarter of british men did for americas first century internal migration was largely driven by farming moving west to new land but toward the end of the and in the early century migration began to be driven by people moving to american cities small and large this pattern added a twist after world war ii when more people began moving outside their local region particularly to the sunbelt before the roughly percent of americans lived outside a census division in which they were born and by that had jumped to percent but in the people started moving less internal migration has been in gradual decline ever since across all demographic groups in the percent of men moved across state lines each year over the last decade that figure has dropped to percent the decline is similar for women between and the demographic groups with the lowest rate of interstate migration were people with less than a high school diploma or nothing beyond a high school diploma migration rates for college educated people were roughly twice that in the regional competition for the most skilled and most mobile workers in america many noncoastal states are at a disadvantage although they have some large cities they tend to be farther from other large cities than is the case in the coastal areas the economists stuart rosenthal and william strange looked at the benefits of density and found that they tend to dissipate over distances greater than five miles this advantage provided by clusters of cities is helpful for coastal states which tend to contain many big metro areas like san diego los angeles san jose and san francisco in california or the so called acela corridor stretching from washington to boston but it can be bad news for inland areas with one or two large cities that are farther apart omaha and kansas city mo say or cleveland and columbus ohio the flows of young college graduates out of a state can often be replaced by flows of young college graduates moving in the problem that many interior states face is that young college graduates moving into the state arent keeping up with those that are leaving lots of talented young people all over the country are eager to see new sights what is different and a problem for michigan is that we have an unusually low rate of immigration said charley ballard a regional economist at michigan state university in an email keeping young college graduates would help alleviate the effects of globalization and technological change on these local economies its not surprising that many states with net losses in their young and college educated populations also showed some big gains for donald j trump relative to mitt romneys performance in the map shows the total net migration figures for those with a college degree under between and generally rust belt and midwest states like ohio michigan and iowa and plains states like south dakota and nebraska have seen the largest net losses in younger college educated people the places that are gaining college graduates tend to be coastal and southern states like california maryland texas and south carolina two exceptions to this trend are new york and massachusetts states that also produce a large number of college graduates to begin with one reason that inland states have a reasonable case for disappointment at not keeping their young college graduates theyre helping to pay to educate them a majority of college graduates get their degrees from public universities which are partly funded by state governments of course this doesnt diminish the other important benefits that public universities bring to each states economy but if states are losing more college graduates than they are holding or bringing in theyre effectively subsidizing other states skilled labor forces cities in these states do have some advantages the cost of living is lower mostly because housing is cheaper outdoor recreation is often more accessible still these areas are in a bind without jobs to offer luring young college educated people is hard at the same time its hard to create jobs without a college educated labor force to mr ballard its not clear that one policy proposal exists that could jump start the process it really is a chicken and egg problem he said i dont think theres anybody out there that thinks theres some quick easy solution in the days when cities competed for manufacturing advertising low wages and reliable utilities was often enough to draw businesses mr ballard pins his hopes of attracting more young college educated workers to michigan on efforts to market cultural amenities and natural beauty he points to the grand rapids artprize an arts festival that awards half a million
maybe i shouldnt have been surprised that donald trump could be elected president but i was i live in brooklyn and work in manhattan two of the most liberal places in the country but even online i wasnt seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness occur social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my community into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in hindsight that failure makes sense ive spent nearly years coaching facebook and instagram and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i dont want to see and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an article or clicked on a link or hid another the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i didnt realize that most of my family members who live in rural virginia were voicing their support for trump online and i didnt see any of the pro trump memes that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my feeds and the only election day selfies i saw were of people declaring their support for hillary clinton to be clear im not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my worldview they did exactly what i told them to do blocking out racist misogynist and anti immigrant comments hiding anyone who didnt support black lives matter all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than percent of our countrys population consumes news on facebook finding alternative perspectives shouldnt have been that hard i knew about eli parisers theory on filter bubbles or the idea that online personalization distorts the type of information we see and even so i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my fingertips and yet i didnt look in april mark zuckerberg chief executive of facebook addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network facebook he said has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet the internet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever before he said weve gone from a world of isolated communities to one global community and we are all better off for it but thats not what has happened zuckerbergs idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on facebook the political divide has only been entrenched further its the buzzfeed dress debate only for our entire lives we are two countries one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the internet once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like facebook and instagram is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into it but there have still been a few islands of digital wilderness a galpagos of sorts where culture thrived untouched they included vine and snapchat and even tumblr which were homes for marginalized ideas theories and lifestyles the video sharing app vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my own including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see them prospering aware a young woman living in saudi arabia who goes by the name amy roko used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the mall goofing off at home in her most viral video she stares into the camera her face covered in a niqab save for her perfectly outlined eyes expletive called me ugly she snaps i said expletive where the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one niqab to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an app and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the network and people did so with abandon meaning that vines appeared scattershot around the web defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text message direct message email rokos vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black american named brionna london who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty you can draw a straight line from brown women in saudi arabia to black women in america a marvel unto itself a window into the way the internet flattens space and time a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides at vines peak it had more than million monthly users who watched videos billions of times and it excelled at showing these sorts of commonalities that say black kids in new orleans lived and looked a lot like white kids in florida and yet twitter which owns vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to advertisers could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature afloat following news about twitters decision to close the service there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing vines remains but its most likely too late to salvage the community there in its earlier days snapchat offered its own version of cultural exchange the app had an incredible series on city life that gave users direct windows into different worlds people submitted

seven forays president elect trump and his companies have made as libel plaintiffs he won only once when a defendant failed to appear but the standard measure defending his reputation and achieving victory in court isnt how trump says he thinks about his investment i spent a couple of bucks on legal fees and they spent a whole lot more he told the washington post in march about the hefty sum he spent on the case against obrien i did it to make his life miserable which im happy about trump was wrong warner books spent less than he did and obrien paid nothing but that doesnt make trumps central idea any less jarring that libel law can be a tool of revenge its disconcerting for a superrich plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics once installed in the white house trump will have a wider array of tools at his disposal and his record suggests that more than his predecessors he will try to use the press and also control and subdue it as a candidate trump blustered vaguely that he wanted to open up our libel laws i asked his spokeswoman hope hicks by email what he meant by that but she didnt answer the question its not within the presidents direct powers to change the rules for libel suits but our legal safeguards for writers and publishers arent foolproof in the last few years trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press the members of this club are innovators they have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy but an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like obrien or even destroy entire media outlets this kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the press which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection only percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the trusts the media to report the news fully accurately and fairly according to a gallup survey conducted in september this mistrust has been growing for a long time but it was stoked by trump during the campaign he called the reporters who covered him scum and whipped up yelling and booing crowds there is no consensus among his supporters that the press should hold those in power accountable a recent pew survey found that only half of trump backers agreed that it was important in a strong democracy that news organizations are free to criticize political leaders media outlets have won many cases by persuading a judge to dismiss them but since they have succeeded in only percent of the libel and privacy suits that have gone to trial a dip from percent in the previous decade according to the media law resource center the median damage award has increased fivefold since the to million the figure includes three big verdicts over the last eight months against gawker rolling stone and the news observer in raleigh n c these include run of the mill libel suits and its too early to say that the sky is falling on the press but its darkening the high bar for winning a libel case in the united states was set in when the supreme court decided new york times v sullivan in that case widely hailed as one of the courts strongest stands for free speech l b sullivan a city commissioner who supervised the police in montgomery ala sued the times over an ad in the newspaper signed by civil rights supporters the ad turned out to include minor factual errors sullivan said its depiction of how the montgomery police responded to civil rights protests made him look bad under the rules at the time a libel plaintiff was entitled to victory if he could show that the content that harmed his reputation was false the alabama jury agreed with sullivan on that point and awarded him in damages with similar cases pending the times pulled its reporters out of alabama but when the newspaper appealed to the supreme court the justices threw out the sullivan verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel the court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was published with actual malice translated as knowing or reckless disregard for the truth by the the number of libel suits decreased and if suits did go to trial they frequently ended in defeat for the plaintiff in two examples from that era gen william westmoreland sued cbs and ariel sharon the israeli defense minister sued time magazine neither man won damages those outcomes as well as losses in other high profile cases were a major deterrent for plaintiffs and their lawyers says george
bangalore india when sushma sonty wanted to buy herself some jewelry for her birthday she didnt head to a traditional jeweler as is the custom in india or even to a local store instead she turned to melorra a new website that marries western fast fashion trends with wearable fine jewelry it was the first time i was buying semiprecious jewelry online and i took a risk said ms sonty a human resources manager but it exceeded my expectations she bought a pair of karat rose gold earrings for the equivalent of about not an insignificant sum in a country where the average online monthly spend is about rupees or melorras designs are international and sophisticated like something someone in london or new york would wear ms sonty said adding you dont see these designs in indian jewelry stores jewelry is an integral part of indian culture but most makers here design for big occasions producing traditional pieces with significant price tags based on gold and gemstone weights that focus has continued even though the nation is modernizing at a rapid clip and so are womens wardrobes with urban indian women preferring western ready to wear or casual indian wear as their daily attire ornate indian style precious jewelry doesnt suit such clothes so many either gravitate toward costume jewelry or do without jewelry altogether young women today are not like their grandmothers sitting at home wearing a lot of traditional jewelry said saroja yeramilli melorras founder in an interview at the company offices in bangalore there are now generations of indian women whose dressing sense has changed whose lifestyle has changed whose needs are different and jewelry is no longer playing a role in their lives except on their wedding day ms yeramilli wants to bring jewelry back into focus for these women by developing melorra which started in may into a kind of zara of the jewelry industry she sees it as blending technology fashion and affordable prices with pieces introduced on a weekly basis and she is betting that jewelry will continue to be big business in india which is one of the worlds top gold importers and has annual sales of billion bandana tewari fashion features director at vogue india wrote in an email melorra is capturing the needs of and the spirit of a young generation of women who buy jewelry because they enjoy wearing it in their daily lives a big mind shift from the older generation who buy valuable and traditional investment pieces that are promptly stored in bank lockers this buy now wear now phenomena she continued could very well reflect the live for the moment philosophy that is the hallmark of gen next although a first time entrepreneur ms yeramilli has significant experience in the jewelry business including directing the entry of the well known indian brand tanishq into the united states she is particularly passionate about serving what she believes is a neglected indian market urban women to years old who spend part of their disposable incomes on themselves the companys major investor echoes the idea this is a company that caters to women created by a woman when the majority of online shopping sites today are designed for men by men said sid talwar co founder of the mumbai venture capital fund lightbox which invested million in melorra based solely on ms yeramillis business plan it was lightboxs first foray into the jewelry industry a visitor to the melorra site ms yeramilli says melorra means forever young in norse mythology is presented with designs grouped into collections for work party or casual wear and suggestions for style trends such as crop tops folk flowers and pleats prices range from rupees to rupees for delicate chains hoop earrings stackable rings and modular pieces melorra sources precious and semiprecious gemstones from jaipur and mumbai and uses karat gold a lighter and less expensive departure from the karat weight favored for traditional indian jewelry each diamond order comes with certification from an independent agency and gold is hallmarked ms yeramilli has in house designers primarily in bangalore new york and birmingham england who use computer assisted design to render drawings that are sent to d printing and manufacturing centers in the cities the companys head of sourcing and manufacturing kathrin schoenke is a german who was global head of manufacturing at de beers and previously worked at tiffanys and cartier the company operates on a zero inventory model and it now takes about days from online purchase to delivery but the goal is to reduce the time to five days unlike most indian jewelers the company offers a day money back guarantee and a lifetime exchange of any piece for percent of its original value melorra said that in its first four months of business percent of the sales were from repeat customers something it had not expected so soon as for expansion it hopes to ship to international markets including the united states britain and singapore by early next year i want women to buy jewelry the way they buy handbags and shoes ms yeramilli said with melorra i am making a bet that if we make fine jewelry so affordable and accessible people will come back to us again and again

washington the islamic state has used chemical weapons including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents at least times on the battlefield in syria and iraq since it swept to power in according to a new independent analysis more than one third of those chemical attacks have come in and around mosul the islamic state stronghold in northern iraq according to the assessment by the ihs conflict monitor a london based intelligence collection and analysis service the ihs conclusions which are based on local news reports social media and islamic state propaganda mark the broadest compilation of chemical attacks in the conflict american and iraqi military officials have expressed growing alarm over the prospect of additional chemical attacks as the allies press to regain both mosul and raqqa the islamic state capital in syria the coalition is concerned about isils use of chemical weapons col john dorrian a military spokesman in iraq said in an email on monday using another name for the islamic state isil has used them in iraq and syria in the past and we expect them to continue employing these types of weapons colonel dorrian said that the islamic states ability to use chemical weapons is rudimentary and that american iraqi and other allied troops are equipped to deal with the impact of these chemical attacks typically rockets mortar shells or artillery shells filled with chemical agents the effects of these chemical munitions thus far have been limited to the immediate area where they land the ihs assessment is to be made public on tuesday the new york times obtained an advance copy of the assessment and the location of the reported chemical attacks the analysis did not break down the cases by type of chemical attack in an effort to blunt the islamic states ability to make the weapons the american led air campaign has bombed militants associated with overseeing their production and the facilities where chemical ordnance is manufactured in september for instance allied warplanes attacked a converted pharmaceutical factory in northern iraq thought to have been a chemical weapons production facility as iraqi forces now advance into mosul analysts warned that the islamic state could unleash more chemical attacks as they cede control iraqi forces have reclaimed about one third of mosul iraqs second largest city as the islamic state loses ground around mosul there is a high risk of the group using chemical weapons to slow down and demoralize advancing enemy forces said columb strack a senior analyst and the head of the ihs conflict monitor and to potentially make an example of and take revenge on civilian dissidents within the city at least of the chemical attacks have taken place in and around mosul according to the ihs data but the assessment noted a decline in attacks before the iraqi led offensive against the city mosul was at the center of the islamic states chemical weapons production mr strack said but most of the equipment and experts were probably evacuated to syria in the weeks and months leading up to the mosul offensive along with convoys of other senior members and their families the islamic state is not the only actor in syria to carry out chemical weapons strikes the syrian government has conducted many more such attacks syrian military helicopters dropped bombs containing chlorine on civilians in at least two attacks over the past two years a special joint investigation of the united nations and an international chemical weapons monitor said in august beginning last year american officials confirmed the first instances of the islamic state using sulfur mustard a chemical warfare agent and the presence of the mustard gas on fragments of ordnance used in attacks by the group in syria and iraq laboratory tests which were also performed on scraps of clothing from victims showed the presence of a partly degraded form of distilled sulfur mustard an internationally banned substance that burns a victims skin breathing passages and eyes chemical warfare agents broadly condemned and banned by most nations under international convention are indiscriminate they are also difficult to defend against without specialized equipment which many of the islamic states foes in iraq and syria lack the chemical agents are worrisome as potential terrorist weapons even though chlorine and blister agents are typically less lethal than bullets shrapnel or explosives it was unclear how the islamic state had obtained sulfur mustard a banned substance with a narrow chemical warfare application both the former hussein government in iraq and the current government in syria at one point possessed chemical warfare programs chlorine is commercially available as an industrial chemical and has been used occasionally by bomb makers from sunni militant groups in iraq for about a decade but it is not known how the islamic state would have obtained sulfur mustard the officials said abandoned and aging chemical munitions produced by iraq during its war against iran in the were used in roadside bombs against american forces during the occupation that followed the american invasion of iraq but american officials have said the types of ordnance that have been publicly disclosed so far have not matched known chemical ordnance in the former iraqi inventory the attacks have been geographically scattered and have varied in their delivery systems suggesting that the islamic state had access to and was experimenting with different types of rockets and shells configured to carry chemical warfare agents or toxic industrial chemicals one theory is that the militants were manufacturing a crude mustard agent themselves american officials say another theory is that the islamic state acquired sulfur mustard from undeclared stocks in syria either through capture or by purchasing it from corrupt officials although this theory is not widely held by american analysts
valeant pharmaceuticals international is a onetime wall street darling that has become a punching bag for how pharmaceutical firms drove up drug prices and engaged in questionable sales practices in the process losing percent of its market value the first case to emerge from multiple federal and state investigations of its conduct however portrays it as a victim not a perpetrator the justice department charged a former valeant executive gary tanner with taking about million in kickbacks from andrew davenport the chief executive of philidor rx services a specialty mail order pharmacy while hiding his true intentions from corporate management valeant had a relationship with philidor and in december paid million on an option to buy it but it dropped the association last year philidor shut down in january the criminal complaint depicts surreptitious payments and a cavalier attitude highlighted by an email from mr davenport to mr tanner evoking how the two men would be like butch cassidy and the sundance kid and ride into the sunset the case appears to be a straightforward tale of avarice but there may be more to proving the charges than meets the eye perhaps portending a more difficult prosecution for the justice department was valeant really the victim or was it a willing participant that wanted to build up philidor so it could increase sales of its products mr tanners lawyer issued a statement asserting that his client did his job exceptionally well greatly benefiting valeants shareholders and regularly communicated to his superiors what he was doing mr davenports lawyer took a similar approach claiming that philidor also benefited valeant which is why valeant and its highly sophisticated and active management team sought to buy it mr tanners job was to develop what was called the alternative fulfillment program in which valeant sought to have prescriptions filled with the companys drugs through specialty pharmacies like philidor rather than with cheaper generics in that regard mr tanner was successful and philidor helped the company increase its sales but valeants executives also wanted to develop other outlets for its products which mr tanner is accused of resisting the criminal complaint portrays mr tanner as a classic unfaithful servant who made philidor a key outlet for valeants drugs while working out a secret agreement with mr davenport to get a cut of his profits he is accused of pushing valeant to enter into an option agreement to acquire the mail order pharmacy while denying to his superiors that he had any financial interest in philidor mr tanner received about million of valeants payments to mr davenport money funneled through corporate bank accounts to a shell company controlled by mr tanner if they were trying to hide those transfers the two defendants certainly did a poor job by using an account over which mr tanner had signature authority which would be easy to trace and keeping the money in the united states rather than shifting it to an offshore account at one time the justice department could bring a case against an employee for breaching a fiduciary duty to the employer as mail or wire fraud for violating the right of honest services statute but the supreme courts decision in skilling v united states in restricted this type of fraud to cases involving payment of a bribe or kickback to the defendant not just unethical conduct that deceived an employer figuring out whether the million constituted a kickback to mr tanner is the prerequisite to proving that he committed honest services fraud a federal statute cited in the skilling case defines a kickback as a benefit given to improperly obtain or reward favorable treatment in connection with a transaction whether the dealings with philidor were improper will be the crux of the governments case against the defendants the criminal complaint goes to great lengths to describe how mr tanner kept senior valeant executives in the dark about his role at philidor and the benefits he would receive he also made sure that philidor played a crucial role in the companys alternative fulfillment program by never pursuing relationships with other potential pharmacy partners buying philidor turned out to be problematic for valeant when the company had to issue an accounting restatement after finding that it had incorrectly recorded million in sales to the pharmacy and after questions were raised about whether it properly disclosed the relationship with philidor in its filings with the securities and exchange commission valeant shut down the unit but that does not necessarily mean that the philidor relationship was improper or that the million mr tanner received constituted an illegal kickback valeant was aware of how the mail order pharmacy operated and the role it played in growing pharmaceutical sales a key to wall streets embrace of the company that took the stock to more than per share in the new york times described an analysts view that valeant benefited significantly from its ties to the pharmacy allowing it to increase sales of ailing products and obscure more significant problems with the business unlike the typical kickback scheme in which a supplier pays an official to award a contract that should not have been given the defendants can argue that the development of philidor was a benefit to valeant and the option to buy it was arranged by experienced executives who paid no more than what they thought the mail order pharmacy was worth at the time a decision in april by the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit in chicago in united states v weimert may offer a path for mr tanner to argue that not revealing his interest in the philidor deal does not constitute fraud in that case the conviction of a bank officer who negotiated a sale of the banks interest in a development while secretly taking an ownership interest in the property was overturned the appeals court found that negotiating parties and certainly the sophisticated businessmen in this case do not expect complete candor about
when robert eidelbergs journalism class at john bowne high school in flushing queens convened in september our first assignment was to write an obituary about ourselves we were all about years old without much life experience so the task was to invent our futures did you keep mine i asked mr eidelberg last week soon after i announced my move to the obits staff after years in sports didnt he responded with a laugh prompting me to wish that i could read how i had lived and what i had died of eidelberg is the one teacher ive stayed in touch with all these years he inspired me to enter journalism and each time ive made a significant change in my career ive called him forty four years later he is teaching at hunter college and retains the big hearted enthusiasm he brought to our class he recalled that he asked us to write our obituaries as a way to understand ourselves and test our imaginations it was the biographical version of i spent my summer vacation he said but i wouldnt have gotten so much interesting content if i hadnt framed it as an obituary of yourself id like to think i awarded myself a pulitzer now i will be writing obituaries of others which ive done now and then while covering sports media and business ive written nearly three dozen obits all of sports personalities including the announcers mel allen ernie harwell jim mckay phil rizzuto and harry caray each was in that ghoulish way that obit writers feel a pleasure to write some years ago i wrote an advance obit of vin scully the great brooklyn and los angeles dodgers annnouncer who retired last month after years at the microphone as i wrote about his unmatched career i couldnt help but think of what i might be adding to the article as i observed scullys gracious farewell to fans as he approaches his birthday would it be that he recorded wind beneath my wings for his wife as a christmas gift or his revelation that he would resume rooting for the giants the dodgers arch rival and the team he grew up loving when he and the giants were new yorkers the occasional obit that fit into my sports department schedule was a diversion not a full time endeavor the news of my departure for the dead zone generated three distinct reactions from friends colleagues and people i write about the first was congratulations the second involved fond memories of the obits i have written and the third was something a lot like dont call me for a while thats right people who recently lobbied me to write about them now hoped i would lose their phone numbers until they die a well known local sportscaster summed things up nicely when he said in an email i always looked forward to you writing a long feature on me in the paper of record now i can wait a loooong time in fact lets skip it completely the most unusual reaction came from a famous and sophisticated former sports commissioner will you interview me for my advance obit he asked teeming with apparent awareness that his years as a successful commissioner entitled him to an advance obit and that at age something he was overdue for one bill mcdonald the obituaries editor believes that this is the first offer by a big newsmaker to volunteer to talk to us for an article that he will never read we more frequently hear from second string types he told me looking for posthumous glory
ten days removed from the still fresh shock of donald trumps election around lunchtime on a friday i navigated the jagged lines of steel barriers police officers and secret service battalions with big dogs and big guns surrounding trump tower the glass and marble shopping mall tourist trap and tv set had been transformed into the unlikely plotting ground for the nations immediate future it was anybodys guess what was taking shape inside the gilded bunkers clots of media people passers by and protesters crowded the lobby and nearby streets for the occasional clue or at least glimpses of marla maples and prime minister shinzo abe of japan kellyanne conway posed for a selfie with a few lucky cops the locus of the scene was a bank of elevators ferrying staff cabinet candidates and the competing maestros of the trump transition to and from various nerve centers over several floors every time a bell sounded announcing the opening of an elevator door lobby heads would bob expectantly is that what jeff sessions looks like i heard a photographer ask no doubt a host of key trump orchestrators and luminary actors were making ample use of auxiliary entrances and exits sneaking in and out new rumors predictions and potential firestorms seemed to materialize every hour the kremlinology of the incoming white house is shaping up as knotty to say the least not one of trumps initial high level hires has any experience working in a white house how will they work with the volatile real estate and reality show maven in the oval office with his proclivity to make decisions based on the last person he speaks to with his children playing an uncertain role his son in law a possibly ever present whisperer how will it all work with trumps senior adviser steve bannon former head of breitbart news who has a long rap sheet of racial ethnic and sexist affronts and a long running war on washington republicans i had gone to trump tower to see reince priebus the republican national committee chairman whom trump named as his chief of staff five days after his election in the same release in which bannon was named chief strategist and senior counselor bannon was mentioned first for kremlinologists scoring at home and his appointment has consumed the bulk of the attention given his hyperprovocative ways but priebus in a sense filled a more exotic role he would be the chief establishment ambassador for a president whose brief and meteoric political career has been predicated on blowing that establishment up a generous reading is that trump is trying to foster a yin yang tension between his top deputies who will represent his own diametrically opposed impulses the simpler reading is that trump hasnt thought that much about this and is simply trying to reward and surround himself with people he feels served him well in the campaign its almost like a puzzle mystery priebus told me last summer i dont recall what we were talking about but priebus had a knack for homespun wisconsin logic and particularly throwaway lines that would stick with me i kept thinking of the puzzle mysteries that were playing out up and down trump tower even though i showed up friday without an appointment with priebus and was confined to the lobby watching tourists ride up and down its now famous escalators priebus and i started talking last spring as i was undertaking an article for this magazine about the seemingly fracturing state of the republican party we kept in touch during the campaign drank the occasional miller high life in his office and exchanged the sporadic email priebus was constantly going on tv saying he was certain trump would win even though he could read polls and precedents like everyone else still he carried on as the chief carrier of trumps choppy water because thats what a party chairman does he smiles and spins and swallows his best laid plans and audibles in the name of getting his nominee to the finish line in a sense priebus who squired his future wife to a local g o p banquet on their first date was the purest form of political hack that trump would rail against as he bulldozed the g o p for his efforts during the campaign priebus gained the respect and gratitude of trump loyalists especially the fiercest loyalist donald j trump himself he also won derision and ridicule he was the subject of multiple stories in the onion his spirited tv defenses of trumps indefensible behavior drew him comparisons to baghdad bob saddam husseins chief propagandist during the early months of the iraq war whose dubious predictions of imminent victory despite growing devastation all around made him an international laughingstock long before trumps victory back when it seemed like a long shot i asked priebus whether he would consider taking a job in a trump administration maybe a plum ambassadorship to somewhere yes he said wisconsin it was a throwaway answer to a throwaway question which was laughably hypothetical anyway but i never had a sense he had thought that much about a trump administration job besides possibly staying on as r n c chairman whether or not the donald prevailed for all his well honed sheepishness priebuss just a kid from kenosha wisc shtick belies a penchant for main stages big ticket rooms and high level company no shortage of reince priebus photos hang on the walls of the r n c s headquarters on capitol hill he can be a little star struck he travels far and often to appear with candidates and party dignitaries at events where his presence is not necessarily required priebus was giddy when i spoke to him last spring as he prepared to attend a party for times most influential people at lincoln center we were on the phone him walking through the lobby of the j w marriott after a packed day of fund raising

the haggler loves a great consumer mystery like why are hotel thermostats so varied and confounding do we really need smart refrigerators and heres one that recently flitted across the hagglers mind when taco bell conceived its cheesy core burrito basically a cheese burrito stuffed inside a beef burrito did it ever consider cramming the whole concoction into yet another even bigger burrito and calling it the triple dare emails to taco bell with this perfectly reasonable question were not returned some consumer mysteries have solutions some of them do not in this episode an example of the latter q i work at a nonprofit in manhattan toward the end of may i received a bill from a company called idc servco for worth of printer toner less than a month later i received another bill for worth of the same product historically we have paid to a year for toner though to a different company as i later learned we had never hired idc servco when i got the second bill i called the company a representative was very apologetic but basically made it seem that we had in fact ordered in toner this guy agreed to lower the price of the second shipment to at the time i assumed we had a deal with this operation so i wrote a check and thought that was that but the weirdness was just starting soon after i got a call from a man at a company id never heard of he said he worked with idc servco and would cut the cost of the second shipment to if i paid his company via credit card and canceled the check for to idc servco i gave him our companys credit card number i canceled the check to idc servco and thought once again this is over of course the guy from idc servco called and he asked why the check had been canceled i really thought we were caught in the middle of a fight between two companies a few weeks later a man named jim snodgrass from idc servco called me and said the people from the other company were crooks and that i needed to report fraudulent activity on my card it turns out that we had been sending money to idc servco as far back as in all we spent and wound up with cartridges if you do the math we paid about times the price charged by amazon we used cartridges id happily send back the remaining for a refund can you try to arrange that deal susie polsky new york a perhaps dear reader you are wondering why the haggler described this case as a mystery heres why idc servco really should not exist in late june the federal bureau of investigation the united states secret service the police in huntington beach calif and the orange county district attorneys office arrested people linked to the company and charged them with operating a scheme to sell toner at inflated prices the toner swindle has been around for years and idc servco sounds like a classic example inflated prices were just part of it prosecutors said idc servco would pose as the regular toner suppliers of its victims which turned out to be a very effective sales strategy from the time it began operating in idc servco netted about million from companies the authorities said mostly small businesses and charities so why is idc servco still apparently in the toner business what connection does this company have with the one that prompted the arrests the haggler called jim snodgrass ms polsky had his number and he sounded like a perfectly reasonable guy he offered to answer questions via email unfortunately neither the haggler nor ms polsky could fully make sense of mr snodgrasss account of this misadventure the clear part was that mr snodgrass thought idc servco had done all that it could to help ms polskys nonprofit organization he also said that idc servco had begun winding down operations and ceased taking new orders in june in a follow up the haggler asked about the june arrests though mr snodgrasss name was not on the list of those arrested an obvious question presented itself why did idc servco appear to be in business as recently as september i have referred this to upper management who will refer it to the companys attorneys he replied the next day that is the extent of the response that i can give you no lawyer from the company has contacted the haggler when the haggler suggested the swap requested by ms polsky mr snodgrass did not reply the haggler was still left wondering about the peculiar resilience of idc servco so he contacted thom mrozek a spokesman for the united states attorneys office for the central district of california in los angeles in an email mr mrozek wrote that the operator of idc servco gil michaels was told to shut down the company as a condition of his release on bond this summer we recently spoke with his attorneys who informed us that the company was no longer doing business mr mrozek continued we will look into this matter in an attempt to determine if the same company perhaps operating under different operators is still in business so its a mystery to the authorities too if any answers emerge rest assured they will be shared right here
forty one tibetans who were detained by the nepalese police while they were on a bus bound for india have been released to a nepalese human rights group an advocate for tibetan rights said friday the advocate kate saunders of the international campaign for tibet said early friday in london that the human rights group the human rights organization of nepal and other contacts in kathmandu nepals capital had told her that immigration officials and the police had allowed all the tibetans to be released ms saunders said the tibetans were mostly from kham and amdo tibetan regions now ruled by china and were on a pilgrimage to sacred sites in nepal and india it is likely that they planned to go in january to an important buddhist ceremony the kalachakra teaching in bodh gaya an indian city she said it is unclear what those tibetans will do now they could end up at the kathmandu transit center of the united nations high commissioner for refugees from there many tibetans make their way to india against chinas wishes ms saunders said the tibetans were in a very precarious situation the human rights organization of nepal did not respond to an email asking for an update on the situation of the tibetans the dalai lama the spiritual leader of the tibetans is expected to teach at the kalachakra gathering from jan to jan he offers this teaching regularly at different places and many tibetans try to make their way to bodh gaya the site where the buddha attained enlightenment when the dalai lama travels there from his home in northern india to teach in chinese security officials detained hundreds of tibetans after they returned from the kalachakra in bodh gaya many of them were released later the chinese government opposes the dalai lama and calls him a splittist but tibetans remain devoted to him and many try to travel to india to see him since a widespread uprising across tibetan regions in the chinese government has increased its security presence on the tibet nepal border and has prevented many tibetans from leaving the number of tibetans making their way to nepal has plummeted china is also exercising greater influence over nepal and tibetans in nepal complain of more detentions there and a ban on anti china protests ms saunders said chinese officials were making great efforts to prevent tibetans from traveling to bodh gaya this year for the dalai lamas teaching what we know is that the chinese authorities have tightened controls on tibetans in some areas going from house to house to confiscate peoples passports she said in the last few weeks government officials have confiscated passports in the tibetan areas of qinghai and gansu and according to some sources also in sichuan and the tibet autonomous region she added some tibetans who have already arrived in nepal and india for pilgrimage and for attending the religious ceremony in bodh gaya have already been ordered to return and their families pressured by the authorities so no doubt for this group of things will be very difficult she said particularly given that they will now be on the radar of the chinese authorities in nepal given the nature of the relationship between the two governments
ang lees new film billy lynns long halftime walk contains sights perhaps never so vividly rendered in a movie when bullet casings fly from a machine gun each one is clearly visible rather than appearing in a blur when billy lynn a soldier on leave from iraq tears up at the national anthem or experiences battle flashbacks during the smoke bombs of a destinys child performance the emotions in his eyes register with uncommon clarity on the other hand when steve martin mugs as the owner of a pro football team his face contains a level of detail normally preferred by dermatologists these are the trade offs of working at a high frame rate the speed at which a film is shot and in some cases projected the rate has a strong effect on an images sharpness mr lee shot billy lynn at frames per second far faster than the standard for about years few theaters are presenting it at that rate so most viewers are out of luck or perhaps better off depending on your views on frame rates for some directors like peter jackson who shot the hobbit at frames per second to largely negative reaction and james cameron higher frame rates are the future of movies an opportunity to correct the motion blur that afflicts fast paced action sequences shot at the standard rate introducing billy lynn at the new york film festival last month mr lee who won a directing oscar for his work with d digital cinema on life of pi expressed trepidation about reaction to what he called kind of an experimental movie and asked the audience to keep an open mind he had reason to worry david rooney of the hollywood reporter offered a typical reaction the film he wrote in his review had the somewhat distancing hyper real sharpness of many outsize high definition flat screen tvs high frame rates arent new theyre used in video games and on television and thats the problem viewers accustomed to the softer texture of movies see the extreme sharpness of high frame rate cinema and feel intuitively that theyve stumbled into a theatrical broadcast or a football game if you start increasing the frame rate of the movie whether its or or it can tend to start looking like a television show said douglas trumbull a director and special effects expert who has been a pioneer in high frame rates in the he developed the showscan process which ran at frames per second still he said there is no need for that association i can guarantee you that we can make a high frame rate movie that does not look like television the frames per second rate at which most movies even digitally projected ones are shown was always something of an accident at the dawn of sound when the rate was standardized going more slowly would have muddied the audio and going faster would have exceeded the sensitivity of existing film stocks said dean goodhill one of the editors of the fugitive and an inventor of a high frame rate process from the late that never got beyond a demonstration clip there were other experiments with frame rates in the celluloid era the todd ao process of the ran at frames per second cinerama used three simultaneous projectors and ran at frames per second in both cases the higher rates were needed to accommodate outsize screens that made flicker and blur more visible tim j smith an academic who studies visual cognition at birkbeck university of london said there is no scientific reason frames per second should be more appealing to viewers what were coming into the cinema with is the same audiovisual sensory system we have before we go into the cinema he said in theory he said the move to a higher frame rate should lead to more natural more effortless processing by the viewers visual system acculturation may be the main reason moviegoers find the sharpness off putting its interesting that people are sensitive to it mr smith said theyre seeing a crispness to the image which is unfamiliar in the cinema context their main frame of reference seems to be tv or video and kind of implied by that association is cheapness or documentary or immediacy is it good to have that its hard to know but the film historian david bordwell said that high frame rates have only re emerged as a solution to a problem that is specific to digital cinema particularly murky digital d which grows less murky when frames are added he noted that at least on a normal size screen there was never any of the dreaded stammer in the panning shots of kenji mizoguchi max ophls or jean renoir people who doubt it should see the films to check he wrote by email for mr trumbull who demonstrated high frame rates for mr lee but did not take part in the production of billy lynn the increased film speed of his showscan process was a natural outgrowth of the move toward bigger screens and bigger spectacles in the and but a faster rate was never taken up as the industry moved toward multiplexes and tiny auditoriums he was effusive about mr lee and his willingness to experiment a wonderful brave and courageous effort he said but after watching the movie at the new york film festival he wasnt pleased i was really upset when i was at the premiere of billy lynn that it was in a very narrow small screen theater he said he felt that it was projected with too much illumination that it needed dark time between frames billy lynn has almost no darkness in response ben gervais the films technical supervisor said we found that there was no real advantage in terms of the way that the movie felt with added dark time mr trumbull also said that it was crucial to present the film on a screen that filled
as questions about valeant pharmaceuticals internationals business practices have mounted over the past year its relationship with the mail order pharmacy philidor rx services has come under the most scrutiny on thursday the justice department said that andrew davenport the chief executive of philidor and gary tanner a former executive at valeant were at the heart of this relationship accusing the two men of secretly agreeing to promote the pharmacys interests inside valeant including persuading valeant to buy an option to acquire philidor the justice department charged both men with multiple counts of fraud and conspiracy the arrests are the first charges in multiple state and federal investigations into valeants business practices according to the complaint filed wednesday in federal district court for the southern district of new york mr davenport who pocketed about million after the purchase option agreement went through used a series of shell companies to transfer a million kickback payment to mr tanner the government said that mr tanner used an email account under the name brian wilson to secretly communicate with mr davenport in one celebratory email to that account mr davenport wrote that he could picture the two of them on a butch and sundance ride into the sunset mr tanner was forced out of valeant in mr davenport remained at philidor until the company shut down in january both men said through their lawyers that they intended to defend themselves preet bharara the united states attorney for the southern district of new york said at a news conference on thursday that the investigation was continuing he would not say whether his office was looking into valeants accounting practices in a statement valeant noted that the company and its top executives had not been charged in the case and said it was cooperating with the investigation federal prosecutors announced on thursday that jpmorgan chase and its hong kong subsidiary would pay about million to settle bribery charges connected to its practice of hiring children of chinese leaders confirming an earlier report in dealbook the authorities investigation revealed that as jpmorgan was competing with other big banks for business in china some bankers concluded that they needed to bring on the children of well connected parents known as princelings we lost a deal to db today because they got chairmans daughter work for them this summer one jpmorgan investment banking executive told colleagues referring to deutsche bank many of the job candidates were unqualified the authorities said but jpmorgan hired them anyway for example the son of a powerful executive who had a wharton degree was described as having a not very impressive poor g p a and had both an attitude issue and a napping problem the son of a chinese official who did very very poorly in his interviews still secured a position in new york only to be transferred again a jpmorgan banker later said that the hire sent out an e mail where he made some inappropriate sexual remarks his peers said he was immature irresponsible and unreliable but he kept his job shareholders of tesla and solarcity showed their support for elon musk by approving the merger of the two companies on thursday tesla said more than percent of its independent shareholders voted for the deal under the terms of the transaction solarcity shareholders will receive of a tesla share for each share of solarcity that they own at thursdays closing prices that offer is worth about a share or just shy of where solarcity shares closed critics have argued that the deal would weigh down tesla financially shares of tesla have fallen about percent since the company first disclosed its intentions in after hours trading on thursday shares of tesla were little changed shares of solarcity rose nearly percent in after hours trading several federal reserve officials are scheduled to speak today william c dudley president of the federal reserve bank of new york will talk about the consumer expectations survey esther l george president of the kansas city fed and robert s kaplan president of the dallas fed will attend a conference in houston on oil and the economy and charles l evans president of the chicago fed will give the opening remarks at a symposium on community banking
it was a warm saturday morning in october and on a acre farm just north of bell buckle tenn runners gathered at the starting line preparing to run one of the quirkiest yet most arduous of races called the big backyard ultra the race required contestants to run a course that spanned miles over trails etched out of the farm every hour if you finished faster than an hour you got five or minutes to rest or eat or go to the bathroom before the next round if it took you longer than an hour you were out the race would keep going hour after blessed hour until there was only one runner left the reason the big backyard ultras founder gary cantrell had chosen miles for his course is that if you ran loops in hours youd have gone exactly miles big was the name of his dog and the farm on which the race was run was in fact his backyard virtually all the runners had ultramarathon experience andy pearson had won a miler in pine ariz just the month before with a time of hours minutes seconds babak rastgoufard had placed third in a kilometer race in friant calif last november one man told me he would soon be running from maine to florida another said he was using this race as preparation for a coming race i had come to watch an ultramarathoner charlie engle whom runners world had once described as renowned at the age of engle has been running long races marathons adventure treks and ultramarathons since his late he is not a very fast runner nor a very stylish one but he has a skill thats much more important for the kind of race he prefers an unusual ability to fight through pain and fatigue he told me recently that the moment he craves is the moment when every fiber of his being screams quit i need that moment when i think this sucks is how he put it when he first started running engle did it as a form of penance i was feeling badly about myself and wanted to punish myself he said then as he realized he was good at running long distances ultramarathons and other even more extreme events became a way to test his limits and to some extent build his celebrity five years ago running took on another role in his life it helped keep him sane now engle runs long distances not only because he loves it but because it is one thing he can do that nobody can take away from him to put it another way running has saved his life the first time i ever spoke to engle he was calling me from a telephone in a minimum security prison in beaver w va this was in the spring of three years after the financial crisis in the wake of that crisis millions of people lost their homes because during the bubble they had taken on subprime mortgages they ultimately couldnt afford engle who had gotten caught up in the housing bubble was in prison for mortgage fraud at the time i was writing columns in the business section of the new york times a number of which focused on the unwillingness of the justice department to hold accountable the top executives of the companies that had led the country over the cliff like angelo mozilo of countrywide and yet here was this smallest of small fries who had lost two houses during the subprime crisis sentenced to months in jail for supposedly committing bank fraud the more i looked into it the sketchier the whole situation seemed it had begun after an internal revenue service agent watched a documentary produced by matt damon about an expedition engle had organized a grueling day mile run across the sahara the agent started wondering how engle had time to earn a living with all the time he spent running he opened an investigation it included dumpster dives outside engles apartment that found nothing wrong with his taxes but an undercover female agent assigned to befriend engle got him to brag about taking a couple of liar loans while she secretly had a tape recorder rolling liar loan is the term for loans in which people overstate their incomes to qualify for mortgages they probably shouldnt have millions of people took out liar loans during the housing bubble just as engle did thousands of brokers encouraged them to do so just as engles broker did and as it turns out the evidence against engle was so thin that the jury found him innocent of providing false information to the bank even as it was convicting him of bank fraud go figure the point i made in the column is that theres something wrong with a system that sends charlie engle to prison and lets angelo mozilo go free it doesnt often happen this way but something good came out of my column it helped engle get a book contract two months ago the book titled running man was published the first quarter of it tells the harrowing story of engle as a young addict who cant resist either booze or drugs who drives away people who love him and who has a number of close calls during late night cocaine buys and then after a binge he runs to purge his guilt engles first marathon takes place the morning after a cocaine binge when he finally starts taking sobriety seriously after the birth of his first child running marathons becomes his focus in in australia engle mistakenly enrolls in a not seeing the he thinks it is a there comes a point in the race when engle realizes that he actually craves the pain the pain told me to go on he writes feel the pain welcome the pain use the pain transcend the pain he somehow finishes the race and his career as a long

san francisco an automated army of pro donald j trump chatbots overwhelmed similar programs supporting hillary clinton five to one in the days leading up to the presidential election according to a report published thursday by researchers at oxford university the chatbots basic software programs with a bit of artificial intelligence and rudimentary communication skills would send messages on twitter based on a topic usually defined on the social network by a word preceded by a hashtag symbol like clinton their purpose to rant confuse people on facts or simply muddy discussions said philip n howard a sociologist at the oxford internet institute and one of the authors of the report if you were looking for a real debate of the issues you werent going to find it with a chatbot theyre yelling fools dr howard said and a lot of what they pass around is false news the role fake news played in the presidential election has become a sore point for the technology industry particularly google twitter and facebook on monday google said it would ban websites that peddle fake news from using its online advertising service facebook also updated the language in its facebook audience network policy which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content to include fake news sites in some cases the bots would post embarrassing photos make references to the federal bureau of investigation inquiry into mrs clintons private email server or produce false statements for instance that mrs clinton was about to go to jail or was already in jail the use of automated accounts was deliberate and strategic throughout the election the researchers wrote in the report published by the project on algorithms computational propaganda and digital politics at oxford because the chatbots were almost entirely anonymous and were frequently bought in secret from companies or individual programmers it was not possible to directly link the activity to either campaign except for a handful of joke bots created by mrs clintons campaign they noted however there was evidence that the mystery chatbots were part of an organized effort there does seem to be strategy behind the bots dr howard said by the third debate trump bots were launching into their activity early and we noticed that automated accounts were actually colonizing clinton hashtags a hashtag is used to indicate a twitter posts topic by adopting hashtags relating to mrs clinton the opposition bots were most likely able to wiggle their way into an online conversation among clinton supporters after the election the bot traffic declined rapidly with the exception of some pro trump programs that gloated we won and you lost dr howard said trump campaign officials did not respond to requests for comment twitter executives argued that more people would not follow the programs and so they would be picked up only by those who looked for particular hashtags anyone who claims that automated spam accounts that tweeted about the u s election had an effect on voters opinions or influenced the national twitter conversation clearly underestimates voters and fails to understand how twitter works said nick pacilio a twitter spokesman the researchers based their study on a collection of about million twitter posts gathered in the first nine days of november they selected tweets based on hashtags identifying certain subjects and identified automated posting by finding accounts that post at least times a day for example the top accounts which were mostly bots and highly automated accounts averaged over tweets a day and they generated more than tweets the researchers noted the top accounts which still used high levels of automation generated around tweets at an average rate of tweets per day the oxford researchers had previously reported that political chatbots had played a role in shaping the political landscape that led to britains brexit vote the researchers have coined the term computational propaganda to describe the explosion of deceptive social media campaigns on services like facebook and twitter in a previous research paper dr howard and bence kollanyi a researcher at corvinus university of budapest described how political chatbots had a small but strategic role in shaping the online conversation during the run up to the brexit referendum the bot managers seem to repurpose the programs as well during the british campaign they discovered that a family of bots that had been tweeting around israeli palestinian issues for three or four years had suddenly become pro brexit after the vote the bots returned to their original issue in the case of the american election the researchers noted that highly automated accounts the accounts that tweeted or more times with a related hashtag and user mention during the data collection period generated close to percent of all twitter traffic about the presidential election they also noted that bots tend to circulate negative news much more effectively than positive reports one of the consequences of the intense social media campaigns will be a rise in what social scientists call selective affinity clinton supporters will cut the trump supporters out of their network and trump supporters will do the same dr howard said the polarization of the election is going to make this stuff worse as we self groom our news networks
ottawa the government of canada has a credit rating of aaa and a budget of over billion you would think it could meet its payroll but for most of this year getting paid has been an exercise in frustration for more than canadian public servants not for lack of money but because of a new payroll system that has repeatedly gone haywire one of the is bill ryan a leading seaman in the coast guard a civilian agency his overtime and supplementary pay for duty as an air sea rescue worker stopped coming in july and then in august when he was out in the north atlantic aboard the patrol ship leonard j cowley he discovered that he was no longer being paid at all he tried to address the problem online but the satellite link available to him on the ship was so slow that downloading an email attachment could take a whole day he tried to deal with it by ship to shore telephone but the government employee hotline kept putting him on perpetual hold he finally had to tell his wife back in newfoundland to put off buying back to school clothes and supplies for their three children it makes you feel pretty helpless being or miles offshore when i have poor communications and my wife is at home worried mr ryan said it was an awful lot of worry and strain unwelcome payday surprises like mr ryans have troubled the canadian public service since february when the government switched to the new payroll system known as phoenix and laid off about payroll clerks who were no longer supposed to be needed the government manages a payroll of billion canadian dollars a year about billion government leaders have promised that phoenix which covers about civilian government workers will be stabilized soon but workers and their unions are skeptical and the government has put off extending phoenix to cover the military and the royal canadian mounted police a change that was supposed to happen on nov every imaginable kind of pay problem appears to have cropped up affecting every kind of employee even some political aides to cabinet ministers some workers have been underpaid and others overpaid miscalculated deductions have left some workers with pay deposits that were not much more than pocket change and some like mr ryan were simply dropped from the payroll in error managers in some government departments found themselves lending their own money to subordinates to cover basic needs like groceries merchants in small cities where the government is a major employer have seen sales slump when a temporary system was set up to give emergency pay to affected workers phoenix sometimes immediately took back what the system gave a number of people with skills in high demand like nurses have quit the government to work for employers with functioning payroll systems many of the employees who were hired to operate the phoenix system became so stressed by the flood of complaints that they took sick leave leaving their office in miramichi new brunswick even harder pressed to cope every single payday we get calls from our members said chris aylward the national executive vice president of the public service alliance of canada a labor union when youve got the government of canada not able to pay its employees on time it is a national disgrace still mr aylward acknowledged that the previous payroll system a year old patchwork of software needed replacing in prime minister stephen harper a conservative hired ibm canada to create a replacement based on peoplesoft a software system made by oracle that is widely used by corporations and institutions to manage operations finances and employees what went wrong after that is a matter of debate but probably involved a combination of blunders poor planning and some wishful thinking judy m foote who inherited phoenix when she was named minister of public services and procurement by prime minister justin trudeau last year has asked the countrys auditor general for a post mortem everyone agrees that the job was not easy though many government employees work in to office jobs the public payroll also includes a wide array of people like mr ryan with complicated work schedules and pay rules the government estimates that its collective agreements with unions as well as its own policies have led to more than rules governing wages and salaries debi daviau the president of another union the professional institute of the public service of canada is also a computer systems analyst who had private sector experience before going to work for the government she faults the government for turning to an outside contractor ibm to create the new payroll system rather than relying on its own software developers once that choice was made she said the harper government put so much emphasis on saving money that it undermined efforts to ensure that the system would function well when they say ibm is adhering to the terms of the contract its true ms daviau said the government just didnt scope out the contract properly at a parliamentary committee hearing in september ms foote said the conservatives had skimped on training for the workers hired to run phoenix versus actually buying into what ibm had advocated as the amount of training that really needed to take place while the conservatives have avoided answering direct questions about their role in the system they have repeatedly accused the liberal government of bungling what they started blaming the previous government is like taking home a nice steak from the butcher and then burning it and blaming the butcher kelly mccauley the member of parliament who is the conservative spokesman on the issue said at the september hearing the potential for trouble was apparent early on in may when the conservatives still held power ibm

after more than three years of digging into jpmorgan chases hiring practices in china federal authorities have determined that the bank hired the children of chinese leaders as part of a quid pro quo to win business in the booming nation clearing the way for a costly punishment as soon as thursday the authorities will announce a roughly million settlement with the bank and its hong kong subsidiary according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity the authorities which include criminal prosecutors and civil regulators will accuse the bank of orchestrating a long running foreign bribery scheme when the new york times reported on the contours of a settlement in september it was not known whether the authorities would explicitly accuse the bank of carrying out a quid pro quo providing jobs in exchange for lucrative assignments from chinese government run companies this issue which strikes at the heart of whether jpmorgan violated united states law governing foreign bribery became a focal point of the investigation and the ensuing settlement negotiations the bank argued that the hiring of well connected employees was routine in china and that its own hires fell into a gray area of foreign bribery laws the united states government however concluded that in several instances senior jpmorgan bankers explicitly linked those jobs or internships to securing deals with chinese government run companies the people briefed on the matter said jpmorgan the people said formalized the hiring into what it called the sons and daughters program the bank even went so far as to create spreadsheets that tracked its hires to specific clients and the banks ability to convert these hires into business deals in reaching the settlement jpmorgan is expected to accept the findings and conclusions of the investigators a spokesman for jpmorgan declined to comment as did a spokesman for the justice departments criminal division in washington and the united states attorneys office in brooklyn the securities and exchange commission and the federal reserve which handled the civil regulatory aspects of the investigation declined to comment the settlement which was smaller than once expected because jpmorgan showed a high degree of cooperation with investigators followed a painful period for the bank when the china hiring investigation first came to light in a front page article in the times three years ago it added to a growing list of regulatory problems including the billion london whale trading scandal and a billion settlement with the justice department over the banks sale of mortgage securities in the years before the financial crisis the china settlement will now put to rest one of the last big regulatory headaches for the bank some of the senior bankers suspected of carrying out the hiring have since left jpmorgan just as important the agreement signals the final chapter in the obama administrations pursuit of wrongdoing on wall street that effort garnered big dollar settlements and splashy headlines but no criminal prosecutions of top wall street executives after the financial crisis an absence that has drawn much criticism and public debate the foreign bribery case against jpmorgan is no different the united states attorneys office in brooklyn and the justice departments criminal division in washington are expected to impose a roughly million penalty on the bank but will not charge any of the bankers who doled out the jobs the s e c will assess the largest punishment about million of the overall million settlement while the fed will impose a roughly million penalty the bank also secured a moral victory by avoiding criminal charges the people briefed on the matter said and instead negotiated a rare nonprosecution agreement donald j trumps surprise victory in the presidential election last week could disrupt the public perception that banks are treated leniently steve bannon a media executive appointed as mr trumps chief white house strategist lamented in that not one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with the crisis mr trumps presidency also could be a turning point in how banks and other corporations do business in china on the campaign trail mr trump called china a currency manipulator and threatened to impose tariffs on chinese imports but as president elect he has shifted his tone and promised that the two nations would have one of the strongest relationships no matter the relationship going forward the justice department is expected to continue enforcing the foreign corrupt practices act the law that underpins the case against jpmorgan and that might mean more cases against big banks operating in china the jpmorgan case would represent one of the first major crackdowns on a big bank for violations of this law but deutsche bank goldman sachs hsbc and other banks have also hinted that they face investigations into their hiring practices in china those investigations may fizzle but the jpmorgan case provides a template for prosecutors and regulators to bring these sorts of cases which once seemed far fetched jpmorgans lawyers urged prosecutors not to criminalize hiring practices that were common in the region while hiring an american politicians child in exchange for a government contract is a clear violation of law global companies routinely hire the sons and daughters of leading chinese politicians jpmorgan went even further however and hired the family members of potential clients while seeking their business specifically jpmorgan hired the children of chinese officials running state controlled companies that were seeking banks to help them go public the foreign corrupt practices act essentially bars united states companies from giving anything of value to a foreign official to win an improper advantage in retaining business initially jpmorgan sought to prevent such violations but as the sons and daughters program expanded senior jpmorgan bankers explicitly tied those hires to securing deals with chinese government run companies the people briefed on the matter said in an email previously reported by the times a jpmorgan executive in hong kong linked one prominent hire to existing and

when donald j trump emerged from the haze of his surprise victory in the presidential election one of his first calls was apparently to an early supporter a controversial radio host and conspiracy theorist with a large following the supporter alex jones the host of the alex jones show and the operator of the website infowars says he fielded a phone call on friday from the president elect thanking mr jones for his support the call served as a reminder that mr jones who has been repeatedly denounced in the mainstream news media will remain someone whose support mr trump wants he was just thanking me for fighting so hard for americans and for americanism and thanking my listeners and supporters and to let me know that he was working really hard around the clock mr jones said in a telephone interview this week mr jones said he urged mr trump to hold to his pledges to go after the corruption in the government and at least remove a lot of the establishment aides to mr trump declined to respond to an email seeking comment on the phone call as a candidate mr trump generated headlines when he appeared on mr joness texas based radio show during the republican primary contests for a nearly half hour interview mr jones thanked him at the end informing the candidate that he would be hit for the appearance on what is considered a fringe show despite its large audience among mr joness more suspect stances are his insistence that the shooting at sandy hook elementary school in connecticut was a hoax and that the government is creating chaos by manipulating weather systems he has been loudly and roundly denounced by democrats and some republicans he is also a vocal opponent of trade and immigration two issues that dovetailed with mr trumps hard line positions during the primaries i think hes emerged as the single most powerful voice on the right roger j stone jr a longtime informal adviser to mr trump said of mr jones it was mr stone who connected mr trump with mr jones months ago elitists may laugh at his politics mr stone said adding alex jones is reaching millions of people and they are the foot soldiers in the trump revolution mr jones said mr trump had promised to come on his radio show in the next few weeks and the radio host is positioning himself as someone who will hold mr trump accountable to the most anti establishment voices in his party mr jones said he planned to hold the incoming president to his campaign promises that includes appointing cabinet members who will pursue investigations of hillary clinton he said if that does not happen mr jones said yes people will be upset it will be an indication of a return to politics as normal he added mr jones who railed against the establishment news media throughout the interview also warned mr trump to keep listening to the grass roots voters who helped elect him among the president elects interviews since his victory has been a traditional sit down with the cbs news program minutes one of the most establishment venues in journalism if he starts acting like hes divorced from us and doesnt care about us theyll turn against him mr jones said of mr trumps followers mr trump needs to complete only a portion of his promises he said if he gets percent done people will be happy he said
there are more reasons than ever to understand how to protect your personal information major website hackings seem ever more frequent a set of top secret national security agency hacking tools were dumped online over the past year in may hackers used some of those tools to hijack computers around the world in a medium post quincy larson the founder of free code camp an open source community for learning to code detailed the reasons it might be useful for people to make their personal data more difficult for attackers to obtain when i use the term attacker i mean anyone trying to access your data whom you havent given express permission to he wrote whether its a hacker a corporation or even a government in an interview mr larson walked us through some of the basic steps he recommended we added a few of our own based on additional interviews and news events we encourage you to send any questions or feedback about this article to smarterliving nytimes com encryption is just a fancy word for scrambling your data so no one can understand what it says without a key its useful for protecting information on your computer but also for making sure prying eyes cant snoop on text messages and emails on your phone but encryption is more complex than just switching a couple of letters around signal is one of the most popular apps for those who want to protect their text messages it is free available for iphone and android and extremely easy to use but it does depend on your friends downloading and using it along with you and unlike apples imessage which is also encrypted the code it uses to operate is open source which is easier for an independent security expert to examine without the special permission of the developer you can be sure by looking at the code that theyre not doing anything weird with your data mr larson said in general the idea behind the app is to make privacy and communication as simple as possible said moxie marlinspike the founder of open whisper systems the organization that developed signal whatsapp the popular chat tool uses signals software to encrypt its messaging and in facebook messenger and googles texting app allo you can turn on an option that encrypts your messages heres how to do that on facebook heres how to do it on allo in may cybercriminals used ransomware a type of software that locks down peoples data and threatens to destroy it if the attacker is not paid to hijack hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide such attacks are often spread through malicious email attachments and links a practice known as phishing so make a rule of not clicking on anything when you do not know where it will take you even if it appears to come from someone you know also make sure to update your software regularly particularly your operating system frequently software companies will release updates that patch bugs and vulnerabilities when they are discovered but outdated or unauthorized copies of the software may still contain the security flaws this is a particular problem with computers using microsoft windows the most popular operating system in the world and therefore a big target for hackers finally for those using windows antivirus software can go a long way toward shoring up protection mr chen recommends antivirus tools from bitdefender or malwarebytes your phone may be the device that lives in your pocket but mr larson described the computer as the real gold mine for personal information even if your data were password protected someone who gained access to your computer would have access to all your files if they were unencrypted luckily both apple and windows offer means of automatic encryption that simply need to be turned on in apples macos filevault can be enabled from the security and privacy system preferences panel apple has detailed instructions to enable it here microsoft windows users must be running windows ultimate or the professional version of windows or to use bitlocker heres a guide on how to check and how to turn it on similarly keep your data backed up if something happens to it or you lose it all you can recover quickly without hassle an online backup service like crashplan a favorite of the wirecutter a new york times company backs up your data and encrypts it at the same time even an external hard drive gives your files an extra layer of security backups will protect your photos documents and other data not only from a technical malfunction but from ransomware and other malicious hacking just make sure to test or check your backups periodically you know this by now creating strong passwords and never using the same password across sites is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion not everyone agrees about frequent password changes most say you should use really strong passwords and no more than one password per site then use the password managers but making up new combinations all the time is irritating and inconvenient tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple that is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes its far better to create really strong ones for every login and new passwords can pose security risks because its hard to remember complex ones so you are tempted to write them down that can lead to a lot of hard to remember passwords to keep track of them mr larson recommends password managers which help store many passwords with one master password he said he uses lastpass but knows plenty of people who use and keepass and he doesnt have a strong reason to recommend one over another as far as making passwords up goes dont be precious about it use a random word scramble the letters and sprinkle in numbers and punctuation marks if youre writing passwords down
q a many web based mail services including yahoo gmail icloud and outlook com give you the option of downloading your messages to the computer through a stand alone email program instead of only keeping them online some people prefer this because it keeps copies of the messages locally on the computer for archiving doing this makes the downloaded mailbox contents accessible without an internet connection too for mail services with storage limits downloading the messages to the computer also helps free up space online some people prefer using desktop programs to more easily manage mail accounts from multiple services or to avoid the advertisements that are the price paid for using a free service downloading messages from a web based service takes a bit of setup although the windows and mac operating systems have simplified it by allowing you to select a popular mail service from a list and enter your user name and password to add it to the computers mail program you usually have to enable message downloads to a stand alone program in the account settings of your web based email service keeping your mail online has its advantages especially if you check the account from multiple computers and devices storing your mail online also means it is backed up depending on the mail service you use you may get better spam filtering through the web version google has also added several useful tools to its web based gmail service like instant translation from other languages or messages bundled into topics with its inbox by gmail service
a swedish union has set up a hotline for workers to report instances of mansplaining as part of a weeklong effort to raise awareness of a certain kind of condescending elocution that men use to explain to women things they already understand well actually its not all men who do it of course but a certain kind of man you know him he is probably getting ready to mansplain this article to you the hotline which is temporary and open to men and women was set up by unionen a trade union that represents about private sector employees in sweden and describes itself as the largest white collar union in the world our objective is to contribute to awareness and start a discussion which we hope will be the first step in changing the way we treat each other and talk about each other in the workplace jennie zetterstrm a union spokeswoman said in an email on wednesday its important to create awareness about how seemingly small things that we do or say add up to a larger issue between a m and p m every day this week members are being encouraged to phone the hotline to talk about mansplaining in their working lives the calls will be answered by men and women who are gender experts authors academics and others the most important thing when we consulted these people is that they have knowledge and interest in the issue ms zetterstrm said both women and men carrying valuable experience for such a type of activity so far ms zetterstrm said callers have asked for advice on speaking up when they feel run over by male colleagues and on how to help female colleagues who are being ignored by men in their working groups others have asked how to address clients or colleagues who address only the male employees even when a woman is in charge and how to address men who get credit for a womans work the term mansplaining a portmanteau of explain and man entered popular usage after the author and historian rebecca solnit published a essay titled men explain things to me she described attending a party at which a man insisted on explaining to her a very important book he had heard about and did not immediately seem to absorb that she had written the book with a knowing roll of the eyes and a deep sigh women and some men recognized the experience ms solnit relayed and a new word was born just this year a man wrote to the advice columnist amy dickinson to complain that she had misused the term in her response to an earlier letter she replied that his letter contained an almost magical dynamic others complained that i had misused the word mansplaining but you are the only person to mansplain while doing it and last month the word was featured as an answer on jeopardy predictably the hotline in sweden has prompted a strong reaction the independent newspaper reported that unionens facebook page had been inundated with negative comments particularly from men our intention has never been to point fingers or blame all men our intention has simply been to spark an interest and start a debate at our work places and in society ms zetterstrm said she added that the debate had been lively and said of course its regretful if someone feels offended but the union says it hopes the hotline raises awareness of gender discrimination in the workplace and in doing so perhaps helps to alleviate it obviously not all men subject all women to mansplaining all of the time wrote peter tai christensen one of the gender experts who will be manning the phone lines that would be an absurd assertion and not based in reality but enough women are subjected to it by enough men for it to be a problem that warrants being addressed discussed and resolved

perth australia for this competition the most astonishing name on the start list for meters did not belong to usain bolt but what dharam pal singh of india lacked in renown he more than made up for as an international man of mystery if singh really was born on oct as his passport said his presence would be extraordinary at the world masters athletics championships this would make him not only the oldest known runner in the world but probably the oldest man in the world the problem was many people did not believe his story we suspect that he is lying about his age said vinod kumar the senior joint secretary of the masters athletics federation of india dr thomas t perls of boston a leading researcher on centenarians said the oldest age ever validated for a man was the eldest confirmed person was jeanne calment a frenchwoman who died in at in his experience said perls the director of the new england centenarian study at boston medical center percent of all claims of being or older are false the chances of singhs being and a competitive runner probably equaled the odds of building a rocket ship and going to pluto perls said inconceivable and yet he added if singh was say in his any running he did was still spectacular singh denied exaggerating his age in late october he had more immediate concerns a farmer he lived in the indian village of gudha nearly miles from the world masters championships he wanted to reach perth by oct to prepare to run the and meters he had paid his entry fee but did not have money to buy an airline ticket he also needed a visa he would travel to new delhi maybe a politician there would arrange the necessary funds for australia im willing to stay in a cheap room singh said but i want to go otherwise the oldest competitor would be an australian legend john gilmour a world war ii veteran who was captured by the japanese and put into forced labor malnutrition and the harsh conditions permanently shrouded his vision still he resumed his running career after the war he knew what a body could withstand the pain of sport was nothing compared with the pain of capture to read gilmour needed a magnifying glass he wore sunglasses outdoors to shield his eyes he could see the lanes of a track but he could not read the bib numbers of his competitors faces were smudged he met people and shook hands and said hi and hoped that was enough not to be considered a stuck up bugger if he did not recognize a friend despite his impaired vision he once set world masters records from meters to the marathon he went years without a defeat on the track in his mid he could still run a marathon under three hours his shock of white hair always combed in a neat pompadour even in the middle of races gave him the serene yearning look of a pioneer despite all the adversity in life theres a way to survive said stan perkins an australian who is president of world masters athletics the sports governing body thats john he should have died as a prisoner of war but he didnt he came home and recovered he got back to competing at the absolutely top level on a track a half hour from his home gilmour was coming out of retirement for his first meet in years four thousand athletes from countries were scheduled to compete at the world masters championships from oct to nov the equivalent of the olympics for runners and throwers and jumpers and older gilmour had entered the and in that order in his final event one of his opponents could be dharam pal singh hard to believe gilmour said of any athlete who could be hes lucky to be alive much less jogging around yet despite uncertainty about his age singh was as stirring to some indian athletes as gilmour was to australian athletes hes healthy and active thats inspiring to me said abdussamed ambzhthingal a relative sprinting novice at unlike gilmour who lived a cataloged life verified by documents photographs trophies medals and two biographies singh could not produce a birth certificate they were not regularly issued in indias villages when he was said to have been born such gaps in birth registration tended to skew masters records toward athletes from more developed nations and disproportionately hindered athletes from africa india and elsewhere in asia said harmander singh a social policy analyst and marathon coach from london he had coached another runner born in india named fauja singh now a british citizen fauja singh gained widespread attention in when he ostensibly set eight world age group records at a track meet in toronto and became the first centenarian to complete a marathon yet fauja singh now said to be also lacked a birth certificate he could not convince masters officials or guinness world records of his age none of his achievements have been certified as records people in the third world are at a disadvantage for being taken seriously said his coach harmander singh masters officials vigorously denied bias in the way they treated athletes or apportioned records they were simply trying to be fair to everyone said sandy pashkin an american who is the chief record keeper for world masters athletics this was not considered a trivial matter for competitions and world records given that age groups were divided into five year increments a runner in say the category could have a considerable advantage over someone in the category for four years officials said they had patiently requested that dharam pal singh provide reliable evidence to verify his birth date school records military records baptismal records medical records school records of his children we have absolutely nothing to prove how old he really is pashkin said he could be he could be
phil jacksons description of lebron jamess business partners as his posse in an interview published by espn on monday drew an angry response from james who took offense at the racial connotation of the word the dispute between jackson the knicks president and james who plays for the cleveland cavaliers and is one of the n b a s most visible players also left knicks forward carmelo anthony in the uncomfortable position of having to answer questions about a sudden feud involving one of his bosses and one of his good friends the espn interview was a wide ranging q and a in which jackson talked about the state of the knicks the criticism of his management of the team and his relationship with anthony but james took exception with jacksons description of the group of friends who travel and work with him as his posse james and maverick carter his close friend and business partner both took offense at jacksons use of the word carter told espn com he was bothered because of the idea that jackson said it because james and his friends are young and black he can use that word james said he had lost respect for jackson as a result of the comments we see the success that we have but then there is always someone that lets you know how far we still have to go as african americans james told reporters in cleveland i dont believe that phil jackson would have used that term if he was doing business with someone else and working with another team or if he was working with anybody in sports that was owning a team that wasnt african american and had a group of guys around them that didnt agree with what they did i dont think he would have called them a posse but it just shows how far we have to go but it wont stop us from doing what we need to do as a group james carter and two other high school friends rich paul and randy mims founded l r m r management company a decade ago the agency handles marketing and representation duties for james and other n b a players the company has been successful since its inception positioning james as one of the top athletes turned entrepreneurs of his generation in the espn interview jackson responding to a question about jamess decision to leave the miami heat and whether he could imagine magic johnson leaving pat riley and the los angeles lakers or michael jordan leaving jackson and the chicago bulls turned his response back around to james when lebron was playing with the heat they went to cleveland and he wanted to spend the night jackson told espn com they dont do overnights teams just dont so now spoelstra a reference to the heat coach erik spoelstra has to text riley and say what do i do in this situation and pat who has iron fist rules answers you are on the plane you are with this team you cant hold up the whole team because you and your mom and your posse want to spend an extra night in cleveland jackson did not respond to jamess remarks tuesday he left knicks practice without speaking to members of the news media and did not respond to an email while posse is defined as a group of friends or associates keith gilyard a professor of english and african american studies at penn state said he could understand why james took offense the cultural definition of the word has shifted toward defining drug cartels or in cultural terms the group of hangers on that surround a celebrity what were talking about is a rhetorical moment and one of the things thats interesting about rhetoric is sort of the study of who can say what to whom and under what conditions or can say what whom and under what conditions gilyard said the word in and of itself is never neutral it never means the same in all contexts and when the word is used publicly as by jackson instead of in a private conversation its connotation changes gilyard said when you have an official or executive that uses that language that makes its way into mainstream circulation it has a different meaning he added meaning shifts depending on contexts with jackson unavailable it left anthony a close friend of jamess to answer questions about the subject anthony agreed that he considered posse a loaded term and he said that he would not want his group of friends or family to be referred that way but anthony declined to ascribe any assumptions or intent to jackson do i think he meant it any kind of way anthony said i really dont know i dont think he did i would hope that he didnt sometimes phil just says things and he says the first thing that comes to mind and then probably is in his office right now regretting it i dont know when it comes to phil you just never know whats going to be said whats coming out it depends on whos listening people take it the right way or people take it the wrong way you just never know when it comes to phil i just dont understand him talking about lebron right now in november i dont understand that
in the week since donald j trumps election as president of the united states much has been written about the potential conflicts of interest a sitting president with a global business may encounter less attention however has been paid to the even fuzzier situation of the close family members of a sitting president and their business interests though on monday it became clear that this is another potential minefield at least when it comes to the first daughter ivanka trump and a brand that is largely built on her image a group of journalists including reporters at the new york times and vogue received an email from ivanka trump fine jewelry the upscale brand ms trump founded in entitled style alert and touting ivanka trump wearing her favorite bangle from the metropolis collection on minutes the bangle a gold and diamond bracelet that costs on her website was clearly pictured on her wrist during her interview with her father stepmother and grown siblings with lesley stahl on sunday night such emails are not uncommon among fashion brands which tend to trumpet every celebrity sighting in their products to the world at large what was different about this email however was that it came not from the communications office but from the vice president for sales the person in a brand who would generally work with a companys wholesale partners and that after pointing out the bracelet it urged recipients to please share this with your clients in other words it used ms trumps appearance by her fathers side to directly promote the selling of her products when reached monica marder the vice president said repeatedly i am not available for comment and then when asked if she had sent the email hung up the phone but a day later abigail klem president of the ivanka trump brand said this notification was sent by a well intentioned marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary protocol and who like many of us is still making adjustments post election we are proactively discussing new policies and procedures with all of our partners going forward this is not the first time ms trumps brands have used her role in her fathers political career for marketing purposes in july ms trump wore a dress from her own collection to introduce her father at the republican national convention the next day her company tweeted out a picture of her from the podium with the words shop ivankas look from her rnc speech and a link to the macys website where a similar style from the brand was offered the dress reportedly sold out in a day at the time the decision was met with some opprobrium even though the stakes were lower mr trump has stated that his children will have no formal roles in his white house because they will be running his business and there is no law that prohibits presidential relatives from continuing their own business though section of title of the united states code forbids the use of likenesses of the presidential seal for promotional purposes ms trump has not come close to that but the appearance is still ethically blurred whether or not ms trump knew of the bracelet email before it was sent her name is still on the top of the alert in the past attempts by relatives to profit from a connection to a president such as billy carters introduction of billy beer during his brother jimmys administration and the creation of roger clintons band politics during his half brother bills terms in office were roundly deemed inappropriate the tension between ms trumps position on her fathers transition team and her unofficial but powerful role as a representative of women and the younger generation in his organization and the fact that she is her own best ad and her brand is thus understandably using her as a celebrity makes the issue even more complicated and it underscores her status in the public eye and the amount of attention she will incur the question now is how she uses it
beijing the chinese authorities said on tuesday that they had executed a farmer convicted of killing a village official after the demolition of the farmers home despite months of public outcry in sympathy with the farmer the execution of jia jinglong took place in shijiazhuang the capital of the northern province of hebei he was sentenced to death last november on tuesday he was allowed a brief visit with his family the state news agency xinhua reported while mr jias trial had focused on the brutal nature of the crime he was found guilty of killing the official he jianhua by shooting him in the back of the head with a nail gun it was the demolition of mr jias home that stirred anger among a public that saw it as yet another government snub against the powerless mr jias three story home was destroyed in may to make way for a new property development according to chinese news reports his father had agreed to the demolition in exchange for compensation and a new apartment promised by local officials but mr jia refused to abide by the agreement nevertheless the home was knocked down shortly after the demolition mr jias planned wedding was canceled by his fiance over the following months mr jias appeals to officials citing his opposition to the demolition and what he said was insufficient compensation went nowhere his family said and he snapped on feb he fatally shot mr he the murder and subsequent trial have been a reminder to many of the consequences of chinas rapid urbanization the forced demolition of homes has been a leading cause of protests across the country in recent years dozens of farmers have set themselves alight in an extreme form of protest against the practice in a brief telephone interview before the execution mr jias older sister jia jingyuan said her brother was also a victim forced demolitions have also exposed fault lines in chinas attempts to reform its judicial system a topic that has gained traction in recent years amid rising social tensions chinese farmers with limited education and at the bottom rung of the social ladder often find the judicial system broken and discriminatory lawyers and scholars have taken notice an open letter to chinas supreme court signed by leading chinese legal scholars and lawyers and posted online on monday argued that the courts sentence glossed over local corruption and mr jias contrition for his crime it called the courts determination of basic facts a major mistake and called for mr jias life to be spared the letter said that the lack of a fair minded judiciary allowed an evil administration to trample on residents rights creating countless incidents of mass petition and violence against law enforcement zhang qianfan a law professor at peking university who signed the petition said in a telephone interview that he was disheartened by the execution i think the supreme court had already made up its mind and to reverse its stance is very hard despite the social backlash peoples daily a newspaper controlled by the communist party criticized the petition in an opinion piece published the day before the execution it said that the court must not back down in the face of public anger and dismissed the letter as biased and detached from reality despite official attempts to quell public anger over the execution the outcry might have some impact on chinas death penalty system william nee china researcher at amnesty international said in an email the public got a rare peek into the opaque death penalty system he said and view how hard it is for lawyers to properly defend their clients gain access to legal documents and evidence and have their arguments taken into consideration the intense scrutiny of the courts decision will most likely force judges to act with greater restraint in the future he added
third party travel booking sites such as expedia com and booking com are go tos for travelers in search of wallet friendly accommodations or deals on packages that include both airfare and a hotel stay but as sites to book high end vacations not so much that is until recently today these sites and two new search engines skylark and lola are looking to attract consumers seeking luxury getaways by including prestigious hotels in their inventory and selling discounted packages that combine luxe accommodations with business or first class flights with skylark which is part of the luxury travel network virtuoso users pay an annual fee to get favorable rates on upscale hotels discounted high end packages and phone email and live chat access to a team of about travel agents we want to be a luxury online travel agency where our clients can plan their own vacations but also rely on a travel adviser if they need to said paul tumpowsky skylarks chief executive and co founder if for example a member is considering two hotels in london the connaught and the beaumont they can instant message an adviser to inquire about amenities location and other deciding factors the advisers can also arrange airport transfers theater tickets and tours but skylarks biggest attraction may be the discounts and perks it offers on upscale air and hotel packages a recent example is a four night stay for two at the mandarin oriental barcelona with round trip business class flights on american airlines from john f kennedy airport in new york city to barcelona el prat airport the trip costs for two compared with if airfare and hotel were booked separately and because the mandarin barcelona is a part of virtuoso members who book this package receive the propertys virtuoso amenities such as an upgrade if space is available and breakfast lola a free chat based iphone membership app is also a virtuoso member with around of the apps bookable hotels being virtuoso properties where clients receive extra benefits said lolas chief marketing officer robert birge one example is the ritz paris where perks might include a room upgrade early check in and checkout breakfast and airport transfers lola and skylark are coming into the market at an opportune time said the travel industry analyst henry harteveldt the founder of atmosphere research group because affluent consumers rely on digital technology for much of their travel planning but these high income travelers also use travel agents and both search engines offer a chance to work with agents booking and expedia both around since are also getting into the luxury game on booking com reservations at five star properties grew percent from september to september compared with the same period a year earlier said leslie cafferty a vice president and head of global communications expedia meanwhile is pursuing luxury travelers with the premium package business it introduced last year the packages pair flights in business and first class with upscale hotels and sell them to consumers for an average of percent savings compared with the cost if each were booked separately there is a shrinking price gap between economy and premium cabin airfare and we saw an opportunity to offer discounted packages that bundle these airfares with stays at luxury hotels said sarah gavin a spokeswoman for the company at any given time expedia has at least a few thousand premium packages for sale a recent one at a cost of a person was a seven night stay at the park hyatt tokyo from dec to with round trip business class airfare from new york city some luxury hotels see an upside to being a part of third party travel sites franois delahaye is the chief operating officer for the dorchester collection a group of properties that includes the htel plaza athne in paris which can be booked on skylark and the other three search engines he said that third party travel sites are a way to bring in more business we get a new set of clientele who may not be familiar with our brand and sell inventory mr delahaye said what doesnt make sense about that
arthur brooks hi gail so just when we thought that couldnt get any more shocking it did with a trump victory i told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the universe what with the cubs winning the world series and all i hear that new yorkers are taking it pretty hard are people stocking up on canned goods gail collins greetings from the land of duck and cover arthur not sure its quite sunk in but yes freeze dried foods and subterranean real estate are in demand arthur duck and cover sounds like a hunting club so where shall we begin gail im a little weary of the why it happened conversations lets get right to it what do you think will happen next arthur donald trump will set up an administration the sun will rise in the east my dog chucho will chase squirrels the world will go on gail glad to hear chuchos taking it well arthur he stayed cautiously neutral in the election but hes a very good boy i think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics so perhaps thats a good place to start a conversation about the future ive been amazed since i came to washington at the collective failure to understand that point it is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history in democrats were popping champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics now they see most of their dreams being unraveled and republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable gail hey i made a point things are looking better already arthur both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors the losers err on the side of excessive fatalism like the classic threats to leave the country gail reader email has informed me its way harder to leave the country than one might think we americans arent in all that much demand arthur and the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is permanent they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side gail well looking at a president trump and a republican controlled house and senate id say we are in for a stretch of dumb things presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two president obama did that with health care his agenda was nothing compared to george w bush who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the iraq invasion but obamacare was certainly a big lift it was also a central campaign promise i know you think it was a bad idea arthur i think that strategy is enormously shortsighted i remember thinking when the democrats held the white house and both houses of congress in even though they dont have to it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist republicans into obamacare some day the republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in it and sure enough here we are my point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology thats why he got elected but i think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to this is spinal tap turn it up to give on a few things where you dont have to because someday youre going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most the trump administration might learn from the outgoing administrations horror at seeing some or all of obamacare repealed gail we part company here my perception of obamacare was of a democratic party willing to work on compromise legislation while the republicans just stalled there was no unified republican position just a ton of people who wanted to be deal makers but kept changing their mind but the bottom line is that weve left behind the old lets have a drink after work congress weve now got guys who sleep in their offices and dont even talk to the other side at the house gym arthur secretly a lot of them are actually friends but i take your point and thats another recommendation i would make to president trump make friends everyplace that was the l b j reagan clinton magic dont golf with the same people every week gail since i have no choice im prepared to look on the bright side for a while the republican hatred of obamacare is so great that even if hillary clinton had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through congress trump has promised something better and as of his minutes interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program so well see what he comes up with i know youre a big paul ryan fan his agenda and trumps agenda really dont match do they arthur congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next years and ryan and trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe ryans plan includes a health care replacement plan for obamacare it will actually do some of the things liberals really want like getting more people covered i realize that its very disappointing for progressives to see obamacare repealed but its not like it will be replaced by nothing gail this is one area where the product doesnt usually resemble the recipe i remember presidential candidate barack obama saying all health care negotiations could take place in public on c span grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions im seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt arthur its certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime nobody calls his
if you spend your days amid ancient clay tablets with one of the earliest forms of written language the thought might occur to you wouldnt it be fun to bake your own tablets out of gingerbread for the office holiday party it did to katy blanchard who is in charge of the near eastern collections at the university of pennsylvania museum of archaeology and anthropology the museum has one of the worlds largest collections of cuneiform tablets from early mesopotamia many of them written by ancient scribes who used a reed stylus to etch pictograms into clay ms blanchard whose passions are archaeology and baking used chopsticks a fish knife and a gingerbread recipe that came packaged with a coliseum shaped cookie cutter she once bought not only did her cuneiform cookies beguile her colleagues at the office party they also gained some measure of internet renown after a penn museum publicist posted an article about how she made them from there cuneiform cookies started to become as the newspaper the forward put it a thing bloggers were enthralled including one who said she was taking a class in hittite and opted to practice on shortbread the archaeo culinary trend also exposed an odd subculture of people who are consumed with ancient languages like the guy who uses the twitter handle dumbcuneiform and runs a business that will translate your tweets and texts into cuneiform characters and etch them in a hand held tablet it really struck the world in just the right nerdy place said ms blanchard noting that a number of people including home schooling parents classroom teachers and scholars of ancient languages had taken the idea and run with it people have made some amazing tablets much more complete and creative than mine ms blanchard said some people made full sentences mine just say god build bird and sun cuneiform which is pronounced cune ay uh form and means wedge shaped writing was devised by the sumerians more than years ago and survived until about or a d it emerged at roughly the same time as early egyptian writing and served as the written form of ancient tongues like akkadian and sumerian which thrived in what is now southern iraq because cuneiform was written in clay and important texts were baked for posterity a good amount of it survives today schoolchildren who visit the penn museum get to try their hand the deepest part of every symbol is the upper left because thats where you start with your reed and then you just swirl it around ms blanchard said ancient schoolchildren did the same thing and some of their efforts are on view at the museum written on hand held practice tablets theres like a first day tablet where you can see someone practice the first wedge over and over and over again like i practiced an a in school ms blanchard said in a babylonian classroom she said there would be a bucket in the middle of the room where students would toss their practice tablets for recycling those reusable tablets she said were like the original etch a sketch ms blanchards title at the museum is keeper which involves caring for the artifacts in the near eastern collections and helping visiting researchers and scholars find the right items to advance their work its a combination of putting small things in boxes and knowing where jars of dirt came from as she put it once in an interview the cuneiform tablets are in the babylonian collection which is not in her purview but they inspired her nonetheless it was a holiday party several years ago that prompted ms blanchard to contemplate the similarities between clay tablets and cookie dough she has been making cuneiform cookies annually ever since usually for the same holiday party last year i tried to make a brownie ziggurat modeled on an ancient temple but it did not go over as well she said although ms blanchard surmises that shortbread might also be a good medium for cuneiform it was the gingerbread that went viral inspiring copycats online inspired by ms blanchards cuneiform cookies esther brownsmith a ph d student in the bible and near east program at brandeis university who has been studying akkadian for years went all out for a new years party she baked four tablets of gingerbread each on a by inch pan and copied part of the enuma elish a seven tablet babylonian creation myth onto them a stunning step by step description of this feat has drawn thousands of likes on her tumblr blog ms brownsmith said a friend emailed her a link to the penn publicists article about ms blanchards cookies my first thought upon seeing her how to was oh my god this is completely brilliant and completely my thing ms brownsmith said in an email interview im a semiprofessional baker in my spare time and ive read everything out there about ancient mesopotamian cooking she said i even baked historically accurate flatbread for my akkadian classmates once at the time she was studying the enuma elish for an akkadian exam so the tablets she baked each of which took her about half an hour to inscribe counted as homework at the party nobody wanted to be the first person to break the tablet ms brownsmith said eventually i had to break them up myself to get people eating now that she is teaching freshmen ms brownsmith has assigned one of the two best known texts written in cuneiform the epic of gilgamesh gilgamesh was a mighty king from the mesopotamian city of uruk the name of which is thought to have morphed into iraq and ms brownsmith has translated part of the epic into snacks i like baking for my students mostly to bribe them in to office hours ms brownsmith said so cuneiform cookies seemed like a great way to feed them while also giving a tangible link to the subject of
many seats on ryanair flights could be free in a decade with the airline making its money from sharing revenues with airports boss michael oleary said this week but of course flying isnt and wont really be free the average cost to ryanair of carrying a passenger is according to the companys annual report while the average cost of a ticket is thats a loss of around on every ticket it sells but it was able to record a large profit because it made around from ancillary revenues in other words baggage charges priority boarding sandwiches and drinks sold on board travel insurance and so on it turns out the average traveller spends on extras which is where the real money is so if you really want to be a low cost traveller the trick is to avoid all the things ryanair tries to sell you dont buy extra legroom or priority seatsryanair charges each way on top of the normal fare if you want to reserve a seat in rows one and two or and by the emergency exits as they have extra legroom most other seats on ryanair are charged at an extra each way yet frequent travellers know a trick that works most of the time whereby they obtain a premium seat without paying extra during the booking process you will be asked to reserve a seat just click no thanks ryanair will subsequently send out emails to remind you to check in and imploring you to pay for a reserved seat ignore them the best time to check in is between two and three hours before your flight in most cases you will then automatically be allocated one of the premium seats crucially make sure you complete check in before the final two hour deadline after that you will have to do it at the airport at a cost of why does this work we have not had this confirmed by ryanair but the thinking is that it does not sell all its premium seats but does fill most of its aircraft it keeps the premium seats open until the last possible moment but the final few checking in have to be seated somewhere so they are rewarded with one of the empty premium seats the problem with this trick is that it is not guaranteed and crucially only really works for solo travellers if you are in a group then it will mean you are almost certainly split up ryanair told us while we welcome enterprising ideas its important to note that our load factor for october was and the only way for customers to guarantee their preferred seat is to purchase a reserved seat dont waste on a bottle of water a bag of m ms is on its flights but a bag bought at asda costs all know that you cant take more than of liquid through security on board ryanair capitalises on this by charging a stiff to thirsty travellers who want a bottle of water but all you have to do is pack an empty plastic bottle and fill it up at a water fountain after security in the airport terminal some airports presumably at the behest of retailers will hide the water fountain as best they can but there usually is one at gatwicks south terminal it is on the upstairs concourse down a corridor leading to the toilets and theres nearly always a savvy traveller there topping up their bottle those dinky wine bottles can also be found for in duty free before flying although ryanair rules say you cant drink your own alcohol on board of course once on board it will sell you wine at per mini bottle the same goes for snacks you are perfectly free to carry fruit vegetables and all solid foods through security in your hand baggage although soup will breach the rules sandwiches on board ryanair cost but you can make some at home before ryanair says you are free to take your own food and a bag of m ms is on its flights but a bag bought at asda costs avoid baggage costsa bag costs each way and another or if its above that each kilo costs another tenner unless its the depths of winter and you need heaps of clothes ryanairs free baggage allowance though mean should get you through you are allowed a free hand luggage bag the size of a small wheelie plus a further small bag ryanair representatives used to have a stormtrooper reputation for seizing vaguely oversized bags weighing them and charging accordingly but in recent years have become more lenient martin lewis from moneysavingexpert demonstrated on the itv tonight programme how to squash a vast amount of stuff into your jacket or coat wearing a pocket scottevest us survivalist jacket he managed to squeeze in a laptop two books a towel passports a t shirt socks magazines and much more even though it was heavier than hand luggage airlines dont have rules to stop it yet he said ignore the priority boarding feeit remains a mystery to frequent travellers why so many people opt for priority boarding which will be on a ryanair return it is not uncommon for priority customers to be first down the steps to be greeted by a bus waiting on the tarmac but when the bus doors open its a free for all some people opt for priority to ensure space in the luggage rack but it can be easier and faster to leave your wheelie bag on the tarmac to be put in the hold for free and then collect it on arrival but the hotel and car hire arent badryanairs hotel booking service is provided by booking com and its car hire by cartrawler com which pays a commission to the airline we thought that might mean its cheaper to buy separately but when we tested prices for hotels in dublin for a weekend we found that

a wonderful and wide ranging discussion of an immensely complex and emotionally charged issue some final thoughts fighting corruption forcing the hand of policy makers and developing community based responses to poverty are vital to elephant survivalhuman elephant conflict cannot be avoided but we can try to control how humans reacta network of parks and wild lands is needed to allow elephants to roam naturallystamping out demand and the legal market in china is going to be difficult but the government appears to be serioushope for the future is not lost but it is probably limited to small pockets of land an entirely self indulgent question i will admit but thats my prerogative this excellent panel give us measured hope for the future november many countries afraid it will not possible we often forget central and west africa where elephants are in many areas doomed if we cannot stop the current elephant poaching crisis your grandchildren will probably be able to see wild elephants only in a handful of african countries in the eastern and southern africa tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people simonhedgeswcs november but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat poaching build community support for conservation reduce hec reduce trafficking and dramatically reduce demand for ivory the number of places with significant numbers of wild elephants functioning as they should will be very much smaller than now but there is real hope kenyadan november think so karl because high value tourism areas will be maintained they might be private however like ol pejeta and lewa in kenya unfortunately in getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the wildlife you know what the word in english is for pest animals with no value vermin current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of rural african communities monicawrobel november i think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant specialists talking about the species we can get ivory under control and poaching significantly lessened and i strongly believe that if we do want simply islands of elephants but connected migrating herds we have to plan this now and in the next years while we have something to work with this applies in asia too where the iucn asian elephant specialist group just met last week for all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the question is back to you all are you with us we need you to make your desire known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their habitat asian elephants are monica wrobel whose organisation elephant family focuses on asian elephants paints a frightening picture of the future monicawrobel november the past years of asian elephant populations have been wiped out without action this iconic animal could be facing extinction within decades which is why this species is listed as endangered they now number as few as across countries in asia with probably occurring in india habitat loss and fragmentation of populations are causing declines and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing them as well as hunting however retaliatory killing for crop raiding such as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains wires or setting out poison bait such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants have been reduced to crop pests especially in places where people have settled and have no history of living with or knowing how to live with elephants dan stiles also thinks things are looking bleak kenyadan november destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer it remarkable how well they done in india and sri lanka when you think of the population pressures unfortunately it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase in india and carvers are still churning out the ganeshas and saraswatis i read how various states are planning corridors etc heres what can be done says wrobel monicawrobel november asia though we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more where elephants need to move and what they need to eat we can lessen the interaction between people and elephants and help people co exist safely we can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are ready with the answers so there is hope but we need to act now importantly as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal poaching in africa we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in africa to protect space and empower people to allow our spectacular largest land mammal still have room to roam our biggest project at the moment with other ngos is our corridors campaign http elephant family org what we do campaigning corridors on email wim kerkhoven asks why we cant use funds from tourism to support local communities so they dont turn to poaching theres just not enough to go around says andrea crosta november africa there are working examples of involving local communities in the way you suggest it simply a drop in the ocean there are million and millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually blessed with tourism and you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or brokers to create havoc there s a huge human toll behind the ivory trade and poor exploited people are a big part of it rahul raman november the same situation here in india even with tourism the number of poor people who actually benefit from it i e whose lives are uplifted by its effects is a very small number whatever the solution is it has to be more
this bloodbath of an election a friend emailed me like watching someone get murdered another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the vietnam war the third vietnam draft dodger is now commander in chief welcome to the full flowering of the era of trump which began with that now mytho epic glide down the escalator at trump tower where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic words when mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some i assume are good people if ever a monument is erected to the trump presidency then surely these words shades of gettysburg will be carved into the marble walls along with blood coming out of her wherever fifty bucks a steak and i would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding in true demagogic fashion trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the gut to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many civil temperate americans hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own niceness how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled up years and years of internalized micro aggression from a culture that kept insisting on diversity inclusiveness tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these years and to be free of it freed from this code that was jamming us up that was relief akin to a lung puncturing primal scream from the start trumps rallies had the air of the tent revival that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and ecstasy lets not fool ourselves a friend wrote i cant stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a repub winning the election which would be bad enough this is white supremacy winning calm down were tempted to say its really not that bad stances are taken things get said in the heat of a campaign and we could take heart in the newly gracious conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that steve bannon the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to otis the town drunk on the old andy griffith show was named senior counselor and chief strategist for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term alt right but we know already we know we know we know white nationalism aka honky purity along with thick glistening lardings of apocalyptic racism and a style sense that falls somewhere between springtime for hitler and queer eye for the straight guy prior to his gig on the trump campaign bannon spent four years as chairman of breitbart news which he proudly declared to be the platform for the alt right as breitbart chairman bannon presided over such headlines as gabby giffords the gun control movements human shield birth control makes women unattractive and crazy and two weeks after a white nationalist murdered nine members of a bible study group at a black church in charleston south carolina hoist it high and proud the confederate flag proclaims a glorious heritage find myself not sleeping at night a friend wrote the first president endorsed by the ku klux klan noted another then there was obama being obama on the day after the election we have to remember that were actually all on one team a mans character is his fate as heraclitus said and what a strange twisted fate indeed that barack obama cerebral disciplined cool ever seeking to reconcile and accommodate has had to deal with an opposition that very much regarded him as not on the team there was the birther movement for starters the closet muslim conspiracy theories the terrorist fist bump founder of isis teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner all this damage hes done to america is deliberate said marco rubio during one of the republican debates which is a laugh if obama wanted to trash the us all he had to do on taking office in was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to oblivion but the issue is bigger than any particular president after his post election all on one team remark obama continued the point though is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow citizens because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning democracy this goes to the heart of the matter the american system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of power the separation of powers and checks and balances that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early as gop leaders in congress newt gingrich and tom delay chief among them declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation democrats in gingrichs world of moral absolutes were the enemy of normal americans gingrich and his allies were fighting no less than a civil war with liberals and as he declared in a speech to the heritage foundation this war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil wars and so began the constitutional hardball and scorched earth tactics that have characterized the past quarter century of american politics you may recall the gingrich orchestrated government shutdowns of and over budget disputes and the impeachment of bill clinton for lying about a blowjob in more recent times
in a more conventional soccer universe indy eleven might be preparing for a season against the likes of the los angeles galaxy and seattle sounders in only their third campaign the team from indianapolis finished second in the second tier north american soccer league runners up in the standings to the new york cosmos who also beat them on penalties in the championship playoff with average attendances of about the club is hoping to get approval for an seat stadium in a couple of years it is not hard to imagine indy boasting a major league quality team in a major league quality stadium with only one thing missing major league soccer in american sport improvement does not mean that the only way is up weve always said we want to play at the highest level possible said tom dunmore indys senior vice president of marketing and operations we want to have the best standard on and off the pitch were obviously part of a system where you cant earn that through merit on the field so were working to grow the nasl thats our focus a place in mls is not won through sporting success but is a strategic outcome based on lobbying location and spending power the result of a cold eyed business plan rather than prowess in the penalty area when new york added a second team to join the red bulls it was not the cosmos nasl champions in three of the past four years but new york city fc a new entity built by the billionaire backers of manchester city do keane and gerrard departures spell the end of la galaxy galcticos era read morewhether soccer in the us wants or needs promotion and relegation is a debate that pulses as one of the pressure points of operating a global sport in north america where some fans envy the dramas elsewhere but major leagues have heavily centralised structures clubs are franchises and professional soccers rulers have an aversion to risk informed by memories of the old nasls rise and fall in the and the topic was given fresh impetus by mondays release of a report from deloitte which contends that reworking the us soccer pyramid to introduce promotion and relegation could stimulate changes that would benefit the sport from top to bottom the report argues that it would increase attention translating to higher attendance and broadcast viewing figures force owners to work harder to improve their teams and infrastructure battle harden players in a way that would aid development all the way to national team level bring the us in line with overseas leagues and lead to stronger structures and more investment from the grassroots up the study commissioned by silva international investments whose head riccardo silva co owns the nasls miami fc includes a survey of us fans which found that believe that pro rel would boost american club soccer i do think that for the game to realise its full potential in the us promotion and relegation feels like part of the solution said dan jones of deloittes sports business group we very deliberately havent put a timeline on it because theres a lot of practical detail to be worked out as to how you would actually go about implementing it that would include stabilising and organising the lower leagues and creating a compensation package palatable to mls clubs who endure relegation as well as figuring out how to handle the increasing number of lower league teams affiliated to mls sides but with expansion fees now in excess of providing a key revenue generator for a league that last year claimed to be losing money it is hard to imagine mls would give away spaces for free and the commissioner don garber dismissed the concept as recently as this month charleston battery has won four usl championships so i suppose in one way if you look at it we could have been promoted four times said andrew bell whose own career trajectory is a testament to american social mobility he started off as a taxi driver after emigrating to south carolina from england joined the team in as a play by play announcer and was named president in the battery of the third level united soccer league have one of the best stadiums in the lower echelons and last year beat houston dynamo of mls in a pre season friendly bell knows the pain of relegation and the joy of promotion he is a boyhood fan of reading fc but he does not think the us is ready for it i think theres a realism that its really not going to happen any time soon in my opinion maybe im wrong but i just cant see how we could change the system where that could be possible he said weve been playing since mls has been playing since its really not that long so maybe in the future its going to be the long term future theres a chance that it could change and we could see that but i dont think were really at that mature level yet with mls on a solid footing and out of its teenage years though some believe that continued progress requires dramatic change rather than a cautious ethos that has fostered incremental growth there is an incredible market for pro soccer in the us it is presently reined in by an uncompromising major league system that served its purpose well during the initial phase but years later needs to evolve as it is now holding the growth back said jerome de bontin the former general manager of the red bulls by email soccer fans like the european style pure merit system us tv audiences of european leagues are there to demonstrate that the us fans like the competitiveness of those leagues the us soccer fan is not different from the european one he or she aspires to the same quality and competitiveness of games the mls
hello i just found out that i am four weeks pregnant i cannot carry on with this pregnancy for numerous reasons and i want to have an abortion though it is an option for me in the united states in reality it is not really an option because the to have it done is simply out of the question im hoping you can advise me and are able to help i am absolutely desperate martina read through her email once again and hovered her finger over the send button the message was addressed half a world away to women on web a dutch not for profit group that mails abortion drugs to pregnant women who live in countries where abortion is outlawed martina lives in texas where abortion is restricted but legal making it one of the places where women on web refuses to mail the drugs still martina thought she would try her luck she had lost her job to downsizing and in its place she had found only part time work her rent had gone up lately she was borrowing money for gas there was no question that she couldnt afford to have a child the question was whether she could even afford an abortion martina had an inkling that what she was asking for help performing her own abortion might not be fully legal but she was out of answers she hit send then she began to case the internet for other ways she could cause her own abortion if this scene feels out of place in that may be because there was a time in this countrys history when thousands of back alley and coat hanger abortions prompted calls for the procedure to be legal after the us supreme court established a right to a legal abortion in the decision roe v wade self induced abortions were supposed to become a thing of the past but almost as soon as the court legalized abortion opponents of abortion rights began to whittle them away congress began prohibiting poor women from using medicaid to cover abortions in september obamacare the largest healthcare expansion in decades allowed insurers to continue to pick and choose the circumstances under which they would cover abortion and allowed states to ban the coverage altogether the two decisions have ensured that millions of women who have sought an abortion have had to pay for it out of pocket and a sweeping wave of anti abortion laws has closed clinics in many states cresting with an awesome force over the last five years in such a hostile climate it is no wonder that self induced abortions are still a significant if largely hidden phenomenon one that even pro abortion rights groups are only just beginning to grasp one study of abortion patients found that had tried to at some point in their lives induce their own abortions without professional medical assistance another estimated that potentially of texas women have tried to self induce or at least women its kind of kept under the radar hushed so it needs to be talked about martinathere is no concrete data on how many women in the us have tried to self induce but there is some evidence although it is inconclusive to suggest that self abortion attempts are on the rise from to as the economy worsened and a wave of new restrictions choked abortion access around the country online queries about self induced abortion almost doubled according to seth stephens davidowitz an economist who analyzes google searches into this crisis of reproductive rights now walks donald trump as president trump has promised to restrict abortion even further he has vowed to nominate justices to the supreme court who might overturn roe v wade roe because the court is loath to reverse itself has survived such threats before but trump has explicitly promised to nominate justices who might put roe in their crosshairs in his first major interview after winning office trump described truthfully what might happen to some women if roe v wade were overturned theyll perhaps have to go theyll have to go to another state he said and thats ok he was asked trump replied well well see what happens but we dont have to wait and see what happens history has already shown us what happens when women in the us cant access abortion so has the present day in alone women on web the dutch not for profit received more than emails from us women looking for a way to end their own pregnancies women on web agreed to share scores of these emails with the guardian providing an unprecedented window into the lives of women who feel they have no other option but to end their pregnancies themselves among the hundreds who wrote to women on web was martina she contacted the guardian shortly after she found out about her unwanted pregnancy and shared every step of her journey which eventually took her across an international border she wasnt sure if she faced a potential legal risk and in fact self induction is in a legal gray area and many enterprising prosecutors have charged women who carried out their own abortions with crimes nevertheless martina felt compelled to speak i feel like theres such a negative stigma to this she said its kind of kept under the radar hushed so it needs to be talked about people needed to know she added that abortion restrictions had real victims youre not really helping anyone youre not really protecting anyone youre just causing women who are in these situations who feel desperate to take desperate measures the letters to women on web form a uniform chorus of desperation please and afford and help and fear appear in dozens of places signaling the nature of how these women became stranded now he is threatening me saying i can never leave i am afraid of what he is capable of for a variety of reasons an
a few years ago yahoo chief executive marissa mayer hit the headlines concerning a confidential memo shed sent to employees the message seemed to go against everything we know about how a high tech post industrial economy operates from now on everyone must be present and accounted for at the office working from home is prohibited the memo was carefully worded in the language of collegiality and staff development but employees understood its real meaning if we cant see you we dont trust you it wasnt surprising that yahoo staff were annoyed weve known for years that employees are much more productive if theyre able to harness the freedoms that mobile technology can afford being chained to an office can be counter productive in many occupations employees feel hard done by and fight back as result and rather ironically we see the spread of bossesmany business commentators believed that yahoo was an exception in this regard swimming against the tide of management wisdom in this rich information age then other stories started to emerge that seemed to indicate a sea change investigative reporters at the new york times in revealed the shocking techniques used by amazon to manage its office workers you thought its warehouse workers were harassed wait until you join hq absolutely everything is monitored even the time it takes to answer an email fear and intimidation soon became rife in the office transforming the annual performance review into a daily event as one stressed employee lamented worse was still to come employees at the telegraph recently discovered heat and motion sensors that tracked whether they were at their desks there was no warning employees simply found the devices on monday morning they eventually had to google the brand name to identify what they were a memo was issued at lunchtime by senior management stating that the new policy was to make sure we are making best use of our space in the building none of this sits very well with the official knowledge society narrative old school hierarchies are meant to be dead and buried authoritarian micro managers have no place in industries that need workers to use their initiative share ideas be creative and excel at self management flat company structures and autonomy are the future back in the business guru tom peters even heralded the end of management what to do if you have a difficult boss read moreso what happened why does it feel like there are more bosses now than ever telling us what to do often adopting a needlessly authoritarian tone to answer the question we need to remember where the idea of management comes from sure managers help co ordinate things big organisations need administrators but the modern manager was actually invented in the early us steel industry and with a specific rationale one of the first management consultants fredrick winslow taylor deplored how much control average employees had over their jobs he didnt trust them and if there was a dispute theyd always have the upper hand so something had to change taylor recommended that all knowledge about a job be transferred to a new breed of managers who watch staff like hawks often with a stopwatch in their hand he drove the point home enthusiastically to the extent that workers began to complain that it was hindering their work not helping them yes management was actually getting in the way that was more than years ago when employers were perhaps less enlightened so what about now why are we seeing the same heavy handedness reappear in many post industrial occupations including journalism the it sector retail universities and so forth there are a number of forces in action first were often told that workers are happier if hired on a flexible basis be it as contractors or self employed this may suit some but research shows pdf that poorer pay and conditions often increase discontent and disengagement employees feel hard done by and fight back as result and rather ironically we see the spread of bosses precisely in those industries we would expect to see fewer theyre hired to keep a lid on the seething dissatisfaction caused by zero hours and uber ised jobs the second driver is inequality the greater the division between those at the top and the bottom of any hierarchy then the more monitoring and supervision well see thats because rising perceptions of injustice make conflict and non compliance more likely at the societal level for example its no coincidence that the increasing wealth gap has seen more prisons nosey technocrats surveillance and policing the same principle applies to work organisations just look at the figures in the average ftse ceo pay was times greater than the average worker in the ratio was in the us ceos real pay increased by between and workers only got over the same period under these conditions organisations tend to become increasingly punitive even if such measures interfere with people doing their jobs effectively the third reason for all these managers is the huge importance placed today on metrics shareholders demand them senior bureaucrats swear by them whos pulling their weight and who isnt the only problem is that marginal product what you add to an organisations profit margin as an individual is notoriously difficult to measure productivity usually comes from a collective effort and how on earth do you quantify the more emotional and social dimension of many jobs today in the face of such uncertainty employers either go over the top with every big data tool imaginable such as amazon or simply give up and resort to face to face supervision like yahoo finally research has discovered a sort of sociological law when it comes to hierarchies and bosses they can easily take on a life of their own and automatically proliferate companies end up needing more supervisors to check on the supervisors this is how organisations become inundated with administrators and sooner or later all these
and that is the last piece of action ivan perisics injury time equaliser ensures the derby ends milan were second best for long spells but led twice and were denied a victory that would have sent them second on their own instead they are tired with roma while inter climb to ninth thanks to this point what a game thanks for reading bye min immediately from the restart milan attack and pasalic drives wide min oh wow theyve done it the corner is flicked on by murillo towards perisic at the backpost and he bundles home from a couple of yards min milan have everybody back and are clinging on dambrosio finds jovetic with a cross from the right but abate is on hand to deflect the subs header out for a corner handanovic is on his way up min there will be a minimum of three minutes added time min another minute passes by without any bother for donnarumma min inter are dominant but milan are shutting the game down well their final sub sees pasalic on loan from chelsea trot on for bonaventura min jovetic hits a hopeless through ball forward that ends up rolling out for a goal kick ruining the momentum built up by inter min inter are turning up the heat milan are sitting deep will there be a leveller min big chance for icardi he runs towards the front stick and meets a perisic cross from the left donnarumma saves min the game is becoming quite fragmented now there are lots of cynical fouls and the referees whistle is permanently attached to his mouth min milans second switch lapadula replaces niang min jovetics first act is to be booked for putting an arm across bonaventura as the milan midfielder broke that was silly jovetic is quick and has fresh legs min perisic has a deflected shot thats heading out for a corner until donnarumma riskily makes his way out to save the ball spills from underneath him but he keeps hold of it with a second attempt min inters second sub sees jovetic enter in place of brozovic min bonaventura rolls the ball to kucka he blasts about over the bar dismal but they have killed a fair chunk of time min bonaventura dribbles in from the left and is dragged down by kondogbia who is already on a yellow about yards from goal that will waste another minute min brosovics delivery from the corner meets murillos head but he cannot find the target the ball drifts wide to the left of donnarummas net the keeper is then given a warning for taking his time over the goal kick min perisic wins a corner off locatelli milan make their first sub fernandez replaces bacca min icardi misses another glorious chance he escapes gomez with ease but snatches at brozovics through ball and donnarumma makes an easy stop min perisic goes close again its far more difficult than the three first half chances he missed but this is the closest of all candreva finds him with a no backlift pass the croatian controls and turns from a tight angle his shot looks to have donnarumma beaten but it flashes across goal and narrowly wide min inter now look a tad frustrated and you get the sense milan could punish them again on the break nagatomo has replaced ansaldi which is a clever decision min ansaldi fouls suso again and the inter players are quick to rush over and ask for a second yellow the referee ignores their calls though this must be the inter left backs final chance min mario sends in a cross from the left that is too deep and milan have a goal kick min kucka finds suso again he tries to be a tad too clever this time and is dispossessed by miranda min suso is now clumsily fouled by ansaldi who has already been booked its a free kick and if the inter defender commits another like that he will be off min and milan are back in front once more wow suso skips past an embarrassingly bad challenge from miranda after good build up from bonaventura and bacca before sliding a tidy left footed finish low to handanovics right min brozovic feeds mario down the right he throws a good dummy to get past de sciglio but his shot is tame and donnarumma saves min this game had started tentatively and if you had not watched a milan derby you would have been right to ponder what the fuss was about but the start of this second half has been wonderful min what a hit from antonio candreva the man that accused piolo of kicking him out of lazio a simple throw in on the left is worked to candreva in a central position with milan arguing that the decision should have gone their way in any case he takes a touch before unleashing an unstoppable effort into the top right corner donnarumma gets a touch but no keeper in the world would be able to keep out such a thumping strike this is suddenly looking like a great game min suso tries his luck this time on his left after cutting in again from the right it fizzes well wide min candreva unleashes a right footed drive from yards donnarumma parries it but has time to smother at the second time of asking the game is opening up quite a bit now min ansaldi is booked for fouling suso who then takes the free kick from it kondogbia concedes a corner and handanovic does what donnarumma did moment earlier to claim min inter win a corner brozovics inswinger is confidently picked from the air by donnarumma who then releases the ball immediately to bacca the colombian is unable to control min inter get the game going again can they convert their dominance of possession into an equalising goal an email from kabir sethi an email from jr in
for someone who made his career writing about and founding media organisations rafat ali is surprisingly downbeat about what they can achieve if anything the trump election has shown that we are ascribing too much value to what media can do he says a week after donald trumps victory it has its role it has to continue to do its role its even more important today but the view that it will somehow change the world and change peoples minds or give people the right path its just too much to ask hes not alone in doubting the extent of the established medias influence following an election result which almost no outlet predicted and very few supported but in the post election autopsy many commentators have said at least some of the blame should be laid at the door of facebook and its fake news filled filter bubbles ali shares their concerns particularly about the parallel world where people have no connection to reality in which many millions of us citizens appear to live just the fact of what they believe about muslims that hillary is doing this or obama is doing this its just crazy but he says many of the complaints from those working in tv or newspapers stem from an unrealistic belief in their own impact i think that while obviously this is a huge problem we are trying to get out of media way more than its capable of giving he says its not like if the majority of the media goes away or a big proportion of the media goes away that suddenly people are going to miss it ali has first hand experience of the impermanence of media from paidcontent his first company which lasted not much more than a decade he launched the site in taking what was then a relatively novel approach by applying lessons from one part of the media such as the recording industry to other areas such as newspapers which were grappling with the disruptive powers of the internet it was acquired in by guardian media group for an undisclosed sum in the millions of pounds it was run as a standalone business and ali stayed until before leaving to travel the world for two years in early gmg sold paidcontent to another digital media site gigaom which later that year shuttered the brand and itself closed in meanwhile ali had returned from his trip with a plan to apply paidcontents connecting the dots approach to the world of travel and in the summer of he launched a business called skift with travel journalist jason clampet while most of those writing about the travel industry were focused on one sector such as airlines or hotels ali based his plan on the realisation that travellers simply see an end to end process of getting around the world that seemed to leave a gap for a media organisation taking a more holistic approach while writing in a less stuffy more accessible way than the established trade press in the early days ali who operated as skifts chief executive planned to use the sites reporting as a foundation from which to sell data about travel starting with the way it was marketed online however things did not go to plan and while trying to drum up investment in he hit a brick wall i wasnt able to raise the round he says it was the most humbling six months of my professional career we were three months away from running out of money we were or people at that point we had a famous as in famous in our company moment when we went to iceland for our first off site it was a very seminal moment for us as it was supposed to be a celebration of us closing the round ali and the team tried to work out how to continue growing without any outside investment the answer was to drop plans to sell data and focus on more established ways of making money in skifts case research events and advertising two and a bit years later ali says the business is now profitable with double digit revenue growth heading for upwards of a year within the next months traffic is not huge around million visitors a month but skifts priority is its list of email subscribers which stands at more than the company now employs close to people mostly at its new york headquarters and is expanding into europe with hires such as a uk editor based in london though he chose to build his second company around travel ali did not stop wading into arguments about the travails of established media companies including the guardian he says most mainstream outlets are operating more like drive by media where you hope and pray you show up in a feed but he doesnt pretend to have all the answers i dont have a prescription for any of those people he says its hard always even in our business which is doing very well people say oh my god you guys are doing so well and i say yes then i look back thinking holy shit if they knew how hard it is to build a media company its always going to be hard and trumps victory is going to make things harder not just for the media but also the travel industry which ali says is facing a huge challenges from the insular ideologies that are taking over western politics i think trump has already said a lot of things that will enervate people coming to the us even if he does half the things he said it will have a bad effect on the travel industry his rhetoric stands directly opposite to what the promise of travel stands for the most progressive expression of human curiosity fringe is the new mainstream it is worrying for everyone especially for europe which sits at the centre of immigration issues is there
my boss is bullying me and undermining my confidence but what can i do about it my boss doesnt like me im not sure why and have given up trying to figure it out but its making my working life miserable she undermines me in front of the rest of the team interrupts with irrelevant asides when im trying to lead meetings leaves me out of meetings i should be included in and makes threats that i might lose my job or someone else more junior might lose theirs if i dont do some often irrelevant task i am desperate to leave but feel so undermined by her bullying favouritism and passive aggressive behaviour that i feel worthless useless and unemployable she likes to remind me that i am lucky to have a job i have worked here for years but now feel trapped in a vicious circle what should i do jeremy saysyou dont know why your boss doesnt like you and id be fairly certain she doesnt either shes a bully and bullies are irrational unhappy creatures who derive strange pleasure from humiliating others particularly in front of an audience some bullies achieve their ascendancy through force of personality your boss does it by abusing her seniority in saying this im not asking you to understand her let alone forgive her im saying something more important its the ultimate aim of bullies to intimidate their victims to such an extent that they begin to believe they somehow deserve to be bullied that they are inferior worthless beings and thats exactly whats happening to you you say you feel worthless useless and unemployable and yet you must know youre none of those things in the years youve worked in this place presumably before the arrival of this monster you will have been a confident competent contented person that is at heart who you still are so you must fight very hard not to succumb if she senses you have it will give her still further pleasure and shell even see it as in some way justifying her behaviour i would hope that those in authority will soon recognise the malign influence this person is having and will take steps to remove her but you cant wait for that you need to be deliberately consciously defiant defy your boss by looking at yourself in the mirror and promising yourself that you wont let her win then with all the old confidence that you can muster go out there and find yourself another job readers say keep a detailed log of all incidents and keep all relevant documents even post it notes my lawyer advised me this when i was in a similar situation it didnt stop me from having to leave but i got a much better deal because i had proof of everything aranzazu the only solution is to get out sad and unfair but sometimes life is like that but you can look for other jobs up hill and down dale with no time pressure as an aside once you start looking you will probably find the stress flows away you will have control of the situation captaingrey i was in this situation with a boss who continually described me as difficult to like a cold person impossible to get along with and i really sympathise in the end feeling i was on the verge of a nervous breakdown i simply quit i didnt have anything to go to but felt i had to for the sake of my health i had savings i could live on for six months a plan for low paid work if i couldnt find something else and an alternative plan for retraining in the longer term the day i walked out was one of the happiest of my life the relief was incredible and i felt much better about myself almost immediately in the end i got a job within a month its only in hindsight that i recognise just what a bad mental state id got myself into and i dread to think of the damage if i had stayed i know it is a risk and for some is financially impossible but if there is any way at all you can do it then get out join a union if you havent already and wait until you are entitled to representation keep a log including details of possible witnesses with the help of your union submit a grievance detailing what you are complaining about and what you would like your employer to do about it intermax my secondment is failing as im being denied the it training i desperately needi have recently been promoted to team leader the second rung of the in house managerial ladder i had been working towards this for a year before i finally got my opportunity its on secondment for two months and will get made permanent if it goes well i explained in my interview that although i have a basic knowledge of the in house computer systems i dont have the knowledge that the other team leader or the manager has since i have been promoted i have had to text or ring one of them each shift in order for help i explained that i wanted training and needed it to be able to do my job but have been told its going to be difficult to find the time now things are going wrong and i am unable to fix them there have been occasions where they havent answered the phone and ive been completely stuck and been reprimanded for it on the next shift if this continues i cant see the secondment being made permanent from either side as i dont want to take the job permanently if this is what is to come jeremy saysi suspect youre being just a little too polite and hesitant because you dont want to make a fuss or seem to be looking for
steve hanson part time lecturer in political sociologyi have a doctorate from a great university ive worked on government research projects and have more published work than many tenured staff i have been hourly paid for about five years now but hr departments have been alert enough to knock me out of the system before i could rack up four years and become semi permanent universities accused of sports direct for pay read moreive been working for three places at once for most of those years you have three hr systems and three intranets and three security systems each with their glitches and perversities the negotiation of all that stuff just getting paid is far from automatic stacks up to something like a management role but of course this is without the security or the reward or pay being put in automatically its often like trying to play tetris very fast and then you look at what youre doing all this for and its three hours one week seven another none the next week i earn just over a year my pay always just reduces my benefits which is now universal credit its hard to get by then friends and sometimes even students say things like ah its all right for you being a university lecturer we are seasonal labourers like fruit pickers you have to email every september cap in hand saying is there any work for me this year universities are giving their hourly paid people less hours therefore paying them less i do struggle to get by i live in a housing co op on a day to day basis it means getting big bags of pulses and rice from asian supermarkets as cheaply as possible making a whole batch of something and living off it i cycle everywhere its absolutely no frills ive got a partner we would like a family but it would be extremely difficult and the idea of getting a mortgage is a non starter the reason i am willing to be named here is because there is little left at stake not much left to lose the idea that if i be nice and polite about the situation and dont say

money to make rent particularly in the summer and have to freelance as an editor and proofreader which eats into time i really should be using to develop my own research and publications i am unable to make long term plans because i dont know where or if ill have work next year at the moment i face long commutes and or sleeping on friends spare beds sofas floors or beanbags the night before i teach theres no point in moving closer to work because i might be working at the other end of the country in six months buying a house is out of the question i have moved back in with my parents in order to save even my meagre rent the best time was when i was teaching two courses a semester and doing ma supervision i was earning a year sometimes its as low as casualised contracts do not always pay you for office hours or sufficiently pay you for teaching preparation you are rarely paid for the hours of emailing and advising students outside the days you are working it becomes a difficult juggling act between supporting your students and paying yourself working as a casual zip your lip and do as you told read moreon a personal level ive experienced serious mental health issues and while i have worked very hard at getting to a point where i can function unstable work without a network of colleagues and without any security is proving really difficult three years of temporary contracts have meant that my life has been on hold my friends outside academia are settling down buying houses and getting married meanwhile i have a phd a book thats too expensive for anyone other than a university library to buy and face constant uncertainty im worried that casualised academic labour means that the only ones who get permanent academic jobs are those able to tough out several years of fraught unstable work and i worry that the people able to do that are those with considerable financial privileges without caring responsibilities without financial dependents and those mentally resilient enough to cope university lecturers on the breadline is the uk following in americas footsteps read morecatherine burgass part time lecturer in englishi got my phd in in english literary theory i worked for about six years at various universities on a series of temporary contracts i then had my daughter and was made redundant from the last of those contracts i was at home for five years with my daughter then i returned to work as a lecturer at staffordshire university on a series of temporary contracts including full time and part time my underlying permanent contract remains hourly paid my life is ok because my husband earns a decent wage but i certainly could not support myself on what i earn plus theres the issue of insecurity the fact that your hours can be cut

your homework for this eveningthe fiver isnt going too far out on a limb when it suggests the spanish are better at football than the english consider england have only one major trophy to show for years of trying by comparison spain have claimed three in the last months alone that particular run of success stands as arguably the greatest achievement in the entire history of the sport given they parlayed all their prizes from a bunch of monotonous wins that made george grahams arsenal look like bill nicholsons sp hold on this is supposed to be a compliment isnt it yes theyve been very

maradona back in the day instead in accordance with the prevailing mood and parlance they hold seminars and symposia so after the pre match niceties no national anthems the band of the coldstream guards will simply play the jingle for the open university spain will begin their tutorial by stroking the ball back and forth between the lines in a highly technical fashion meanwhile english student and lecturer elect gareth southgate will diligently fill his moleskine with notes about observations on and a reminder to give john stones a clip round the ear followed by an urgent lesson on the benefits of giving it a good old fackin hoof whether spain will be taking themselves quite as seriously is another matter most of their usual suspects are either knacked or have been given permission to put their feet up for this one so julen lopetegui may hand debuts to the likes of ander herrera and iago aspas and see how things pan out both players practically guarantee old school entertainment herrera is always worth watching as he dutifully explores new methods of sparking almighty rumbles in empty rooms while the entire stadium will be desperately willing aspas to take a cheeky quick

build a business case with your employerbecoming a digital nomad does not necessarily mean you have to quit your existing job and go it alone the majority of people with a nomad lifestyle i know are contractors or have a regular job says peter fabor founder of surf office a corporate retreat organiser since technology enables people in certain roles to work anywhere with a reasonable internet connection remote working suits people who prefer a bit of stability while on the road convincing your boss to let you work remotely can be challenging however especially when the prevailing stereotype of a digital nomad is someone working on their laptop in a hammock unfortunately there is still a culture of presenteeism in the uk so you will need deal with the concerns as well as present the benefits says sarah archer careers adviser and co founder of careertree suggesting a trial period for remote working can help says jordan marshall policy development manager at the association for independent professionals and the self employed this would allow both you and your boss to evaluate whether its a good working arrangement he says you would also be able to consider what improvements could be made in order to make this a more permanent way of working use technology to stay in touch tools such as google hangouts skype slack hipchat and figma make it easy to stay in touch with co workers and collaborate from any corner of the world many workers prefer to send an email than walk to the next floor so whether you are there or in berlin it doesnt matter so much says ellen bard a work psychologist blogger and consultant who lives in chiang mai thailand when working with colleagues overseas having a group video conference call or a weekly group email is a good way to keep everyone in sync she says wanderlust how to become a remote worker live chat read more online tools can also help digital nomads find work on the hoof freelance marketplaces such as upwork com post jobs and projects that can be done remotely dan andrews founder of the tropicalmba podcast and network the community circle suggests learning some internet marketing skills such as search engine optimisation and copywriting which could be useful with the sort of work that is relatively easy to do while travelling although there are myriad ways to stay in touch online it is still important to arrange face to face meetings every now and then that in person connection can be very powerful says bard be prepared for periods of loneliness and isolationpeople who work from home often complain about feeling isolated moving around frequently can amplify this tapping into the travel community in your chosen location is a good way to combat loneliness says chris lorensson founder of nomadic working when youre next to another guy or gal whos also traveling for work or otherwise the travel bond is always there and no one wants to be lonely traveling itself is a great way to meet people suzanne bearne a freelance journalist who describes herself as semi nomadic asks her friends and family if they know anyone at her new destination she can be introduced to turns out theres always a good few connections she says she suggest volunteering as a great way to meet people theres always people in the same situation that are looking for mates jodi ettenberg founder of the food and travel site legal nomads and author of the food travelers handbook suggests basing yourself somewhere where you might find it easy to learn the local language and make friends creating a daily routine joining a co working space going to meetups talks and book clubs can help its a nice way to connect to people in the community where you are presently living she says once youve established connections it is likely you will bump into them again and again the community to me feels a bit like a global village and there are many people im spending a lot more time with in different parts of the world than i would with my friends from home says johannes voelkner founder of nomad cruise a transatlantic cruise for digital nomads eight things to do before living and working abroad read moredo your research bone up on tax and visa requirements before you move somewhere new as the laws vary from country to country if you are only a tourist there shouldnt be much of an issue but if you are away from the uk for more than three years you will no longer be treated as a uk resident and different obligations will apply says marshall visa hopping can be costly and exhausting warns andrews most people fizzle out after a handful of years of living visa to visa a lot of it depends on your level of wealth having an established home base and travelling every month or two for extended periods of time is refreshing but expensive remember that it is not for everyone while the idea of being able to work on a beach at sunset or in the middle of a buzzing city might seem dreamy the lifestyle of the digital nomad does not suit everyone while it can bring great freedom and flexibility it can also be insecure especially if you worry when the next paycheque is coming in it can be hard work theres a lot of change and life is unpredictable says bard ive seen many people burn out and go back to the nine to five world and others take to it like ducks to water successful digital nomads need to be independent self motivated and productive as well as being able to live with the unfamiliar and deal with ambiguity for andrews the digital nomad lifestyle feels safer ive been close to many people whose careers have been taken from them from no real fault of their own i feel that
forty seven thousand hours thats how much time you could potentially waste on email over the course of your working life according to a recent washington post article to put that number in perspective its roughly equivalent to spending five years on email as the writer annie dillard said how we spend our days is of course how we spend our lives and increasingly we are spending our days largely on email the average office worker dips into their inbox about times an hour receives about messages a day and spends nearly of their total working week in their inbox the way to a better work life balance unions not self help read morebut just because were spending all this time on email doesnt mean were enjoying it when i talk to people about their email habits the most common feelings they mention are guilt anxiety and overwhelm certainly not enthusiasm whats more research shows that the more frequently we check our email the more stressed out we feel so why do we spend so much time doing something that we dont particularly enjoy the fact is that even though we might not care for the content of every email we receive many of us are addicted to the act of checking email it activates a primal impulse in our brains to seek out rewards and in this regard were not very different from rats back in the the psychologist bf skinner invented a device called the operant conditioning chamber now known as the skinner box which he used to test behavioural theories on rats skinner wanted to see what effect different kinds of positive reinforcements such as food pellets and negative reinforcements such as electric shocks would have on the animals first he experimented with putting the rats on a fixed schedule of behaviour reinforcement for instance if the rat pressed the lever inside the box it would receive a food pellet if it continued pressing the lever every hundredth time the rat would receive another pellet skinner also experimented with a variable schedule in this scenario the rat didnt know when the reward was coming it might have to press the lever times to get a pellet or it might have to press the lever times to get a pellet the system was random and the rat could never know exactly when the reward was coming surprisingly the rats were significantly more motivated when they were on the variable schedule skinner found that even if he took away the rewards for the rats on the variable schedule they would keep working furiously pressing the lever for a very long time before giving up much longer in fact than the rats on the fixed schedule would is this starting to sound familiar yet for better or worse humans respond to positive rewards very similarly to rats and as dan ariely a behavioural economist who studies the irrational actions of humans explained to me email is a near perfect random rewards system the fetishisation of work is making us miserable lets learn to live again anna coote read moremost of the time when you press the lever to check your email messages you get something disappointing or bothersome a communication from a frustrated client or a boss with an urgent request but every once in a while you press the lever and you get something exciting an email from a long lost friend or if youre really lucky a cat video and its those random rewards that we find so addictive they make us want to push the lever again and again and again even when we have better things to do but it cuts both ways while you might get something good you also might get something upsetting or anxiety inducing and that feeling of queasy uncertainty is another aspect of emails strange allure how many times have you confidently sent off a message only to find yourself stewing just minutes later over why you have not yet received a response wondering if your request or your phrasing had been received as it was intended worried that you yourself should have written back sooner said something differently asked for less or asked for more this problem springs from a lack of social feedback normally when we communicate with someone in person or even on the phone we are reading a thousand little social cues as we talk and deciding what to do next based on those cues it often happens that we will start to say something but then based on non verbal feedback we get from the other person think better of it and take another tack when we communicate through email however that social feedback loop is absent emails lack the facial expressions physical gestures and vocal tone that typically shape our interpretation of what someone is saying and allow us to adjust our delivery in order to get our true meaning across this results in what the psychologist daniel goleman calls a natural negativity bias towards email goleman argues that if the sender feels positive about an email then the receiver usually feels neutral and if the sender feels neutral about the message then the receiver typically feels negative about it in other words its as if every message you send gets automatically downgraded a few positivity notches by the time someone else receives it well thats all well and good you might be thinking but what am i supposed to do about it the solution to our email problem lies with getting more in touch with what makes us uniquely human overcoming the negativity bias and allaying some of its attendant anxiety requires us to upgrade our empathy and enthusiasm when it comes to digital communication to communicate more like living breathing feeling humans than impersonal robots exchanging information a recent study done by the people behind the boomerang email app crunched the data from millions of email exchanges and found that messages that expressed
in a day where the visitors went the better part of the first session without losing a wicket that wasnt a bad fightback from the australians as the afternoon wore on during the final session in particular all batsmen were put under enormous pressure by quicks rabada and abbott through a marathon stint between the two but only one wicket fell that of warner and even that came in bizarre circumstances abbotts delivery ricocheting off his thigh and arm before landing on the stumps khawajas half century came from balls he was routinely beaten outside the off stump as too were warner and then smith but held his nerve before capitalising on some loose deliveries towards the end of play that end came prematurely on the basis of bad light seven overs lost so well be back again at for another long day at hobart tomorrow a long day where australia will have plenty of work still yet to do knocking off the runs of deficit that still remain in an innings where adam voges may well be batting for his career in short be sure to tune in and follow every over with us here at the guardian thanks for your company have a good night thats it stumps the umpires have called it off ill gather my thoughts for a final wrap in just a jiffy i wish i could make a mount wellington reference but truth told i cant see it through the clouds there are patches of blue sky either side of bellerive but to get back on now is a tough ask would require a lot of wind in a hurry three of the four umpires gathered in the middle having a chat so either way well know pretty soon ric finlay aus have knocked off half the deficit with the loss of only two wickets two days to go game not over yet november over australia ooooh yeah khawaja cover driving on the up and doing it with style you get four runs when doing that granted it came the ball after he was beaten outside the off stump oh and now theyre off for bad light let me go outside for a tic and see if i can make a prediction about the likelihood of them returning for what little that is worth stand by over australia just a single from khawaja in response to a relatively quiet maharaj over just doing a job to give the quicks a rest here the spinner fourth ump mick martel is out there to take a light reading the australians would relish the chance to get out of there and into the showers a fraction earlier than scheduled over australia vernon philander is angry okay got it understand okay he demonstrates this with some more annoyed stares after khawaja dispatches a long hop through cover point to begin the over later in the set he took a second this time behind point it was full and swinging but he did enough then a single to mid on to end the over brought khawajas half century nicely played in rugged circumstances balls to get there good going from the australian number three has to get to stumps though over australia chris rogers makes a fair point about the importance of the current two sticking it out if i was adam voges id be praying they get through four more overs so he has the benefit of a nightwatchman ahead of him with his career pretty much on the line they get through maharajs first over after drinks easily enough smith pumping him over midwicket when dropping short remember it was smith who in perth exposed voges by getting out when set late in the day will he look after him today as they take a drink lets whip through some comments chris drew asks if kettleborough is the best umpire in the world theres certainly a consensus forming around that given his freakishly good record in the heavily scrutinised drs era doesnt hurt that hes opposite umpire dar this week who is having a shocker of late ian forth emails in with an oled tv gag and warner being able to watch it tonight without needing to worry about batting tomorrow gee weve got some milage out of the warner tv advert havent we ian adds in reference to rabadas efforts this afternoon interesting subject best spells that did not yield a wicket that it is i remember one from anderson to hussey and haddin at brisbane day they both went on to get massive tons as well any to add over australia a couple to the more set of the two men khawaja timing nicely through midwicket to a full delivery on the stumps philander repeats his angry fast bowler bit from the previous over who throws this time around at khawajas stumps no harm in that what a great contest this is over australia maharaj is on with his left arm tweakers from the river end to replace abbott he races through his over broken up by khawaja who revels in the change of pace by advancing down the pitch to clobber over long on fair enough too after what he has been forced to endure out there so far this afternoon and believe it or not there is a stat about his success with that very tactic what a world the cricket prof khawaja has an outstanding success rate coming down the pitch in test cricket ausvsanovember over australia tough yards for the australians when vernon philander is the man relieving rabada from underneath us here at the members church street end as noted below the attack leader came very close to breaking through immediately a bit frustrated he collected the ball in his follow through to complete the over and did the old pretend to throw at the batsmens stumps routine on smith as bill lawry would say the tension the drama the

i have spent years pushing against apatriarchy that tries to tell me what to look like what to feel who to demur to and that there are many things that icant do because im female the weaker sex i gave birth i wouldnt be balled up on the ground if kicked in the groin its tiring and it takes a toll and ill keep pushing in my own steady way for thomas frank to leave sexism out of his response piece wholesale and to choose to use the word shrill toward the end of his article a word which conjures up images of women leaves me frustrated and tired frank whom im sure is a wonderful person in many respects is as sexist as the next and hasnt faced his own inner demons whether or not you think hillary clinton had the best interest of the lower class and working middle class in mind for frank to say that she isnt really competent that her email server was a real issue and that biden would have been a better choice is just a cloak for his inability to face himself in the mirror to his credit or to the detriment of at least of half of us frank is not alone in his unacknowledged sexism even when we pit a woman against the least competent candidate we could imagine for arguably the most important job there is our society as a whole cant stomach voting for her voters literally stayed home from the polls rather than elect a woman lets throw this frank article in the virtual trash where it belongs and instead read response articles penned by feminists we have work to do india viola amid the negativity and strong words about the result of the presidential election it is important that we stay positive and true to our morals and standards unlike donald trump as ayoung woman feminist and member of the younger generation i can certainly say that i will not tolerate trumps revolting words against women and those who dont fit his mould of a perfect citizen from this i am reminded of the standards of how men should behave towards women with respect and compassion the doom and gloom events of this year have taught and emphasised to me the importance of staying positive and not letting morals and standards slip because of the behaviour of a leader such as trump furthermore hillary clinton has shown particularly to women and girls that anything is possible if you truly believe and that women can be and are champions for this as she said in her speech there is still much work to be done and the only way we will aid the work ahead is if we stand together with positive energy and hope against people like trumps fear and discrimination eleanor sutcliffe in an otherwise searching article sarah churchwell falls prey to the same negativism in attitudes toward women politicians that shes writing about while it is true that a staggering of white women voted against clinton it is not true that once again a female candidate did not carry even the female vote some of women voted for clinton not all white but all women marcia saunders is it possible that we have underestimated donald trump is it possible that the rage racism boasts unpleasant vilification of hillary clinton and ludicrous promises were his carefully calculated pose to woo those voters he recognised as disillusioned with the washington establishment and longing for change that the wall was never going to be built that the secretary of state was never going to be sent to jail that the clampdown on muslim communities could be quietly overlooked that nato would survive and trade treaties would remain untorn he is where he wants to be he will have real power he will use it to get what he really wants he is a wheeler dealer a negotiator he knows how to choose and use talented people who can deliver his goals let us by all means be fearful of what those goals might be but let us also look beyond the smokescreen of his performance in the campaign listen to the change of tone of his carefully emollient victory speech remember how he outmanoeuvred the other contenders and shrugged off the disdain of the republican hierarchy let us hope that american liberals will not write him off as a fool who cannot possibly survive chris harris it is interesting to reflect that while all recent us presidents have made very public professions of attachment to the christian faith donald trump does not appear to share this none of his frequent utterances over the last year have alluded to faith and his actions and words during the election campaign were hardly those of a christian adherent quite the opposite so we may reasonably assume that the tea party religious right a key influence in his election is now headed up by an amoral infidel that would be one of the weirder outcomes of november robin wendt how come liberals encourage violence while exercising their freedom of speech this is something ill never understand you always speak of love and understanding when making conservatives knuckle under to your beliefs yet when you dont get your way after a fair election you unhinge like a crazed three year old filth property damage foul language and disrespect for the individual and country this is a liberal who loses your hypocrisy is staggering kimberly brockway the protesters in american cities all appear to be in the twenties this is the generation particularly if they are college educated who have been brought up on the shibboleths of political correctness safe spaces and cultural appropriation while being protected from viewpoints and literature running counter to their sensibilities all of these are bound to trump democracy they must be shell shocked edward thomas at a time of great uncertainty and anxiety following the election of
its virtually a year to the day since david cameron declared that access to the internet shouldnt be a luxury it should be a right were going to bring fast broadband to every home and business that wants it but for many trying to work in broadband not spots such pledges are increasingly hollow now many communities are taking matters into their own hands and some are hopeful they might be able to secure a solution that would mean they are no longer stuck in the digital dark ages the government has previously claimed that of the country should have access to superfast broadband by the end of but last month camerons successor theresa may highlighted the scale of the challenge when she complained that half of people living in rural areas and so many small businesses cant get a decent connection however its not just in remote locations take damian belson for example he is a web developer who is forced to go to cafes and the library to upload his work because his broadband speed is so snail like he lives in rotherhithe in south east london just a few hundred metres from the towers of canary wharf as he says its almost central london yet thousands of rotherhithe residents are only getting around two megabits per second the average uk broadband speed according to ofcom is and superfast broadband is defined as or more in urban areas it is often blocks of flats that are particulalry afflictedthere are many other digital black holes around the country earlier this year website cable co uk named the places with the slowest average speeds with the list topped by the gloucestershire village of miserden where the typical figure was just and the lowest speed measured was just i live in ceredigion in west wales which according to the news and information site thinkbroadband lies seventh from the bottom out of uk constituencies for connectivity as is the case with many places dealing with the everyday challenges of trying to work within an area with internet speeds supposedly often lower than those at mount everest base camp frustrations run deep in urban areas it is often blocks of flats that are particularly afflicted because many of these buildings have a dedicated line from the ground floor to the nearest telephone exchange they are made of copper and can run long distances slowing the speed at which information travels in some cases communities fed up with waiting for bt to get to them are turning to the growing numbers of smaller companies and local ventures that offer potential solutions for those in supposedly hard to reach areas these include wispire a local service provider based in norfolk that is owned by the diocese of norwich and publishing company archant and uses parish church spires to deliver broadband to remote areas steve maine who was its chief executive until the beginning of this month says in reality fibre cable is a good technology for high transition speeds in urban areas but much more expensive per person in less populated regions you need to use other solutions he adds good reliable broadband is more important than superfast for the majority of people for those getting by on under would be nirvana so how are some of these people faring damian belson about live opposite canary wharf which is almost central london yet the area has one of the largest number of exchange only lines this means there are very few cabinets and so its more expensive for bt to upgrade if youre lucky enough to live near the exchange you can get or but for thousands of us its nearer weve got a pressure group and have been fighting for a better internet connection for four or five yearswhen i became self employed about five years ago i knew it would be an issue but i didnt realise how much i can work from home when im emailing or coding offline but i cant upload anything luckily there are some nice cafes and a good library in the area it doesnt feel like an inconvenience so much until you realise how much time youre wasting it doesnt affect the quality of my work but i definitely have to put in longer hours to make up the time weve got a pressure group and weve been fighting for a better internet connection for four or five years and tried everything based on thinkbroadband estimates around homes in the area cant get broadband faster than and hover around the local council made an election promise a few years ago to solve the problems and last summer the managing director of bt london outlined what he was going to do to improve it in rotherhithe by march im afraid i just dont believe what theyre saying anyway none of bts published plans addresses the issues of those most affected so the figure wont change much in the foreseeable future belson says a company called hyperoptic which specialises in bringing full fibre optic broadband direct to multi dwelling buildings is being very proactive but currently doesnt have plans to connect single houses which rotherhithe has a lot of so this will only be part of the solution he adds that relish a fast unlimited data only supplier covering central london tried to extend its service to his area a year ago but its planning application for a new mast was rejected by southwark council we now feel at an utter loss we would love the council to work with and encourage relish to reapply but to date they have not responded to our questions about them belson says that they dont need the worlds fastest broadband wed be happy with andrew denton between and live in the village of poole two miles outside the busy market town of nantwich cheshire its rural but not remote with several schools industrial estates and local small businesses we only recently moved
alex jones has to switch his phone off at work so the constant text messages do not distract him he gets around a day from payday lenders and brokers offering high cost loans of up to a time need cash we have reviewed your application a typical text reads a loan of up to is ready to complete says another weve received your loan inquiry are you able to take our call reply yes his email inbox is just as full with spam messages from brokers and lenders arriving as often as every five minutes at some points during the day the same lender might send messages at and while two for the same broker arrive one after another taking up any of these offers of credit would not be cheap all the firms offer short term high cost borrowing often at annual rates of more than payday loan complaints to financial ombudsman nearly triple in a year read morejones who is in his early and has a wife and young son is upfront about the fact he opened the door to these lenders a gambling addict he took out short term loans over a few years his debts mounting up until he became insolvent in late recent money worries saw him searching for loans this summer and the floodgates opened once you put the feelers out as lots of people do they start to show their true colours he says there are firms out there who have taken a lot of flak but even with that negative press and extra regulation they are still happy to bombard and harass and even lend to someone who has a history of not being able to pay it back and is in insolvency he says he feels like a drug addict being constantly offered temptation addiction is a very complex and difficult thing he says you have bumps in the road and when you have those bumps the very last thing you need is temptation my life would be immeasurably easier if my drug of choice wasnt as readily available if it wasnt so in my face it would be less of a problem jones may have fallen victim to what is known as a ping tree whereby an application is made through a particular type of site that is itself not a lender but a lead generator it passes your request on to many other firms although the rules around payday loans have been tightened it seems some lenders and brokers are still playing fast and loose with peoples contact details it is not the first time jones has fallen into this trap several years ago he was being similarly inundated with messages from lenders and brokers but since then the industry has come under the stewardship of a new regulator and jones thought things had changed also his credit record is worse in late he and his partner entered into an iva an insolvency arrangement that allows borrowers to negotiate part repayment of their debts over a set period of time at the time the couple could manage to pay a month into the iva after bills and the cost of travelling to work but this summer the rented home they had lived in for eight years was put on the market and they found that their monthly costs had fallen behind the market rate their new home in a less nice part of town costs them a month compared with the they were paying and as a result they are behind on the iva even with negative press and extra regulation they are still happy to bombard and harass someone who is insolventalex jonesdespite the iva jones found he was able to take out new loans from two lenders neither of whom asked him to disclose previous money problems his terrible credit record proved no barrier in the summer citizens advice said some payday lenders were still flouting the fcas guidance on responsible lending with around a quarter of borrowers saying they hadnt been asked or could not remember being asked about their situation it cited the example of a client who was granted a payday loan following checks despite suffering from depression and alcoholism having no permanent address being previously declared bankrupt and having only benefit income for jones the emails and texts flood in even as the lenders he is now behind with get in touch to ask for payments the iva company is also chasing him he has considered changing his phone number but at the moment just turns it off he says he doesnt think unsubscribing will make a difference meanwhile the fca reaffirms that under existing rules lenders are not allowed to send emails telling people that they have been approved for a loan our rules require that firms do not state or imply to customers that credit is available regardless of the customers financial circumstances or status we also require that all communications are clear fair and not misleading if a financial promotion is misleading it is likely to contravene our rules jones says he wants people to know that lenders and brokers are still aggressively targeting borrowers despite the new rules if you fill in your details it doesnt just go to the one company it gets fired out to all of the sharks in the pool over half a million in uk have their debt written off over

how can i restart my career and avoid discrimination now i am using a wheelchair i became disabled nearly five years ago losing the use of my hands gradually over months with my general mobility becoming more impaired im now transitioning into a wheelchair prior to this id been employed for seven years in middle management with the same employer and was generally doing well in my career of years i had never had any issues or performance concerns and was considered a high achiever i was made redundant months after becoming disabled but with a good package i accepted this and moved on i interview well and had a good cv i was offered a new job quite quickly but when i declared my disability the role disappeared i decided after that to not declare my disabilities until i had my foot in the door so to speak i did just that declaring my disability on day one of a new job and was made redundant months later evidence of discrimination was gathered and i was offered a payout cue the next job same thing same outcome now im months into job four and in the same position i know the signs and am manoeuvring before what i believe to be the inevitable happens i know that the law is on my side regarding discrimination but taking a legal official complaint route is distressing and unpleasant and id hate to go through it again i dont want to be in a position where i have to keep on fighting how can i get off this merry go round now that i am a wheelchair user at least i dont have the dilemma of whether or not to declare my disability i dont think my support needs are great lightweight equipment dictation software and wheelchair accessible premises above everything i need a manager who will support me but how can i assess that in the job interview process what do i need to do differently to not just get a job but keep it i dont know how to get my career back on track jeremy saysim very glad you no longer have to make that difficult decision as to whether or not to declare your disability on first contact im pretty sure that in most cases its preferable for it to be known from the beginning but now at least that decision is made for you i am slightly surprised you dont mention any organisations that exist specifically to support people in your situation ive identified several that would seem promising you may of course have approached them but found they led nowhere but if you havent i strongly recommend that you conduct an online search and follow up on those sites that seem to suit you best some organisations specialise in matchmaking would be employees with employers who are actively seeking to take on disabled people what this means of course is that youre not in unspoken competition with non disabled people so theres no question of discrimination coming into play however unconscious as i have no direct knowledge of any of these organisations im afraid i cant advise you or make specific recommendations but do please look into them thoroughly reading your letter again im struck by how little you have to say about your own particular strengths and experience i suspect that you may entirely understandably have become so preoccupied with what you need that youve neglected to make the case for what you can offer in your years work you must have acquired knowledge and specific skills that would be of particular value to potential employers these can prove more attractive to recruiters even if only a minority than more general transferable skills readers say apply for a role at a disability charity or a disabled persons organisation they are used to making adjustments and youd not be judged but id understand if youd feel a little ghetto ised as a disabled person it took me a long time to find an organisation and a role where i felt comfortable and supported but theyre out there bristolianlondoner ask lots of questions at interview about the provisions theyd make the attitude they take should give you a good idea as to what theyd be like as an employer horseshoeman apply for civil service jobs all government departments have a robust anti discrimination policy that starts at the application stage with the guaranteed interview principle for candidates who pass the agreed competency standard katejrrcommuting is driving me crazy its the only fly in the ointment of my dream jobi am blessed in that i have landed my dream job after costly and exhausting retraining hundreds of hours of voluntary work dozens of applications and interviews and a lot of determination and sacrifice i have a satisfying and challenging job in the charity sector that pays well and in which i feel valued the problem is the commute on good days the drive is hour minutes each way on bad days more than two hours and it is becoming exhausting public transport isnt really an option due to remote locations i find that my evenings are lost in a haze of tiredness and i fear know i am becoming unpleasant to be around i used to have hobbies but these are no longer viable weekends are invaluable but i am tired a lot of the time is there anything i can do to alleviate this or do i suck it up i dont want to appear ungrateful working from home isnt really an option as i manage volunteers and need to have an office presence i have considered staying in an airbnb during the week but i would be sad not to see my family every evening jeremy saysdriving yourself for four hours a day and now much of it in the dark is not only exhausting but also potentially dangerous how about splitting your week for example

when hillary clinton relinquished her political dream at the wyndham hotel on wednesday her voice barely quavered she exuded grace and resilience the woman has a true gift for giving losing speeches some of her supporters who began demonstrating on the streets to protest donald trumps victory yearned to hear something else however they would have preferred at least a dash of the defiant tone that hillary rodham struck in her famous wellesley commencement address in that speech she talked proudly about how the women in her class were too young to know what was not possible they were going to reshape the ruling order a pledge that remained unfulfilled in some ways her defeat was pre ordained despite all the polls that showed the white house well within her grasp she has been under sustained attack from the right since her husband was elected governor of arkansas in no one has been more reviled for a longer period of time in american politics although she did not run a flawless campaign the baggage from all the attacks proved too heavy and caused the historically low trust and likeability numbers that proved insurmountable it made the task of re energizing the obama coalition too daunting and depressed democratic turnout in key battleground states facebook twitter pinterest hillary clinton concession speech i know its painfulearly on her band of critics seized on her overt feminism and her clinging to her maiden name and legal career in order to calm them over the next years there were several name changes style transformations and political sea changes from first lady to us senator to secretary of state to two time presidential candidate her distinguished service in those posts only inflamed her haters and the constant shape shifting earned suspicions from the democrats who should have supported her that she was inauthentic her excellent performances in all the debates in were overshadowed by trumps calling her a nasty woman her fierce determination to seek the presidency a second time eight years after being defeated by barack obama in the democratic primaries was seen as evidence that she was relentlessly ambitious her perseverance and resilience were mistaken for power madness for all of this time the shadow of phony scandals followed her beginning with a losing real estate venture called whitewater and ending with her private email server fbi director james comeys hour intrusion into the election coming right as clinton was catching a wave of momentum seemed to seal her fate all of these strands combined to create a literal no win situation and her final quest may have been doomed from the start its beyond obvious to point out that almost all of the criticism and rage focused on her was laced with sexism and involved gender based double standards when she stayed in the background went into listening mode and eagerly worked with older male republicans during her eight year senate tenure clinton got a respite as secretary of state she was obamas subservient helpmate so the hate quieted then too her position as one of the most admired women in the world was restored but every time she sought the big prize for herself in and the hatred and caricatures came roaring back facebook twitter pinterest why america elected trumpmillions of dollars fortified the anti hillary movement just months after she stepped over the white house threshold as first lady a conservative magazine funded by the multi millionaire richard mellon scaife portrayed her as a witch in black regalia and a pointy hat conservative groups like judicial watch came after her with lawsuits she and her husband had dared and succeeded in breaking the conservative republican hegemony the right had established during the reagan bush years their fury consumed washington dc through the failed attempt to impeach bill clinton some of the enemies who delighted in attacking her over the decades worked directly for trumps election including roger stone david bossie and stephen bannon who came from the newer rightwing media bastion breitbart news he was trumps campaign chairman and is said to be a favorite for white house chief of staff a campaign low was when trump brought the women who alleged mistreatment by bill clinton and tormenting from hillary his supposed enabler to the second debate hillary clinton even more than her husband incited the anger of what she rightly labeled a vast rightwing conspiracy and no one understood its structure and sharp contours better than her to arm herself she did what she always did she studied she turned to trusted advisers for help like sidney blumenthal a journalist who wrote a respected book about the conservative movement and to david brock a turncoat whose journalism had once been funded by scaife they too were vilified for trying to fight fire with fire and building a liberal armada to fight back on clintons behalf but she was always outgunned in letters to friends clinton expressed occasional despair over the attacks and wearying ethics investigations all of which have melted away without any charges she told one of her lawyers robert barnett i am just so tired of all this but she always battled on the feminist writer susan faludi author of the famous book backlash also recognized the daunting nature of the fight shortly before the election she wrote in the new york times the left needs to acknowledge what the right has long known that its a fiction to think we can move on beyond the brawl of the without settling it adding and settling it requires helping mrs clinton triumph once and for all against the calumnies that were created to define her as the feminine face of evil in this election her name was coupled with lucifers and trump supporters some dressed in orange or striped prison jumpsuits demanded she be jailed now that they helped bring about her political death they will surely move on to other targets the endless investigations of clinton will
paul farbrace late india wickets have given england a lift read more late wickets lift england after centurions vijay and pujara star for india read more cheteshwar pujara indias local hero digs in for impressive century ali martin read more you wait overs for a wicket from englands spinners and then they get two in four balls having three of them hasnt entirely worked so far at times it has confused alastair cook a man whose immense test career is based on keeping things simple he gave the second new ball to moeen who might have been the indian batsmens first choice from the menu then took him off after one costly over he gave ansari plenty of overs even though he is clearly as befits a cambridge graduate the third man and he rather under bowled rashid who was more likely than anyone to exploit the one thing this dustbowl had to offer bounce still in the end two wickets have fallen in no time and the lid has been kept on the pot for almost the whole day so maybe cook gets half the last laugh this has been a test of five hundreds which could have been deadly dull but one thing has kept it interesting apart from the bounce none of the tons has been a big one on a pitch like this you cant win the match with a baby first innings hundred only the daddy will do but very well played vijay pujara and pujaras dad watching him in person for the first time in a test with a still fond stoicism that shows you where the sons patience comes from thanks for reading and for sharing your favourite lines by the great leonard cohen the last word goes to linda ward dont take your eyes off the banjo for banjo read ball another one the nightwatchman has one job and fails to do it bat padding ansari to give hameed another catch thats and stumps the last five minutes belong to england the day belongs to india over india a well deserved wicket for adil rashid who has been exacting all day with his extra bounce rashids googly is too much for vijay who tickles it to hameed at short leg and departs for thats the end of a formidable innings and a shot in the arm for the match over india woakes persists with his audition for the miser a slightly eerie addition to the cohen correspondence as an email arrives from leonard cohen my name is leonard cohen bear with him and im currently sitting in an office in shoreditch following an inevitable draw trying to manage my hilarious friends messages checking to see if im still alive for the record i love his work although growing up i had nothing but antipathy towards him as teachers used to laugh whenever they discovered my name and colleagues and spouses as a keen poet myself ive always resented knowing that should my self indulgent particularly woeful works ever get me famous my own name is already taken and id have to change it my favourite of his avalanche i dont know how you intend to edit this rambling message for obo purposes if at all im just honoured to be in exchange with a wisden editor thank you leonard i barely had to edit the message at all over india moeen keeps the lid on and the cohen thread continues with an email from lee smith more lines from leonard cohen he says less cricket related but perhaps relevant to other events this week the song is nevermind over india the game has officially gone to sleep the anaesthetist is a dr woakes an email from keith moss in milan leonard anticipating a fictional conversation between michael vaughan and ricky ponting ahead of the ashes over india moeen backs up woakes allowing only two singles the moment of truth in this test now looks like being the third innings when england have to do what india are doing here rise above their weariness and bat with some serenity more on leonard cohen from chris drew no link to cricket but an absolutely beautiful moving song that resonates with me https www youtube com watch v over india alarmed by that flurry of runs cook turns to woakes who might have been banking on a longer rest after a fine new ball spell he restores order but even if india fall apart now they will have saved the follow on and with it probably the game over india moeen takes some punishment from both batsmen as virat drives him for a silky four and vijay lofts him for a swishy six india havent scored fast enough today but they may be about to put that right over india broad keeps kohli quiet until he tries a short one which is shovelled round the corner for four its not that far from barstow who is standing back now greg john joins the conversation about leonard cohen i dont have anything clever to say he begins well be the judge of that greg but i do heartily recommend this malcolm gladwell podcast about leonard cohens hallelujah http revisionisthistory com episodes hallelujahits especially good for people who are down on themselves for having a great idea but havent followed through on it a lovely touch over india stokes gets a rest moeen ali returns and kohl plays a nice little chip into the leg side for only a single as mo like broad has some cover in the cow region more on leonard cohen from dave just the one name so we assume its david cameron not from a song he writes but an aside to the audience in london i studied deeply in all the worlds major religions but somehow optimism kept breaking through sounds like he might almost have been involved a test match at some point it is a religion right oh yes
detroit based digital artist molly sodas latest book project was borne of instagram but not in the way you might think when the multimedia artist noticed her photos being removed from instagram for violating the community guidelines she teamed up with co curator and artist arvida bystrm and put out an open call for submissions of photos banned by the network the resulting project the book pics or it didnt happen is due out early next year their subversive project is interesting for its range of imagery banned images include everything from nipples and pubic hair to a woman wearing a hijab and holding an iphone despite building a name for herself in the art world largely through networks like tumblr and instagram soda says that she regularly thinks about the fact that those platforms dont have her career interests in mind when designing their networks policies i dont feel like instagram as an app necessarily owes me anything soda explains im willingly using these social media platforms but the internet has set itself up in this guided and streamlined way where everyone follows these rules in order to facilitate whatever it is theyre trying to promote meanwhile these platforms are huge corporate entities with an entirely different set of interests i dont think many creators realise the reality of what theyre dealing with including myself indeed as the internet economy is maturing this nascent tension between big internet platforms like instagram youtube twitter and facebook and the creators that provide them with content comes into focus platforms need users to create content which elicits the kind of engagement that is attractive to advertisers users need the platforms to reach wide audiences and potential revenue streams but they want it without fear of censorship however since few brands want to be sandwiched between racism and pornography its up to platforms to figure out how to find the sweet spot of policing their networks without prompting frustrated creators to move on to their competitors laura chernikoff is the executive director of the internet creators guild which was formed earlier this year to represent the interests of creators to big internet companies she says that one of the primary ways this tension manifests is through opaque user guidelines or the lists of rules which outline what content is liable to be removed or demonetised in response to criticism around content removal last month facebook publicly admitted that observing global standards for our community is complex and announced that they would be allowing more items that people find newsworthy significant or important to the public interest even if they might otherwise violate our standards in september youtube weathered a backlash from many high profile creators when it tweaked its notification process for content that is deemed advertiser unfriendly spawning the hashtag youtubepartyover chernikoff explains how the controversy perfectly displayed both sides of the debate the guidelines themselves are very broad and are being enforced by an algorithm without a lot of clear information about what youtube is looking for people think it has to do with tags metadata and titles but its not known exactly how it works chernikoff explains however its easy to understand why the guidelines have to be broad it is youtubes platform and they need to make it a safe space for brands which is a huge part of whats going on here chernikoff notes that compared to other more impenetrable social networks like facebook youtube has been reaching out to creators and nurturing them though sources say it would be unlikely for youtube to outline their exact criteria for content removal and or demonetisation because then itd be easier to thwart a spokesperson for youtube contacted by the guardian pointed to an example of that a recent announcement that every creator who has joined the partner programme can get answers via email from a real person at youtube within one business day using snapchat to give a voice to sexual abuse survivors read morewhile our policy of de monetising videos due to advertiser friendly concerns hasnt changed weve recently improved the notification and appeal process to ensure better communication to our creators the spokesperson went on to say creators are the lifeblood of youtube and were totally committed to ensuring their growth and success so whats a creator who wants to make a living on the internet without fear of their business model being pulled out from underneath them to do chernikoff says across networks many creators are realising the need to diversify their portfolio and not limit their business model to one thats entirely dependent on a single social network be it an ad revenue share model such as youtube or a more indirect brand building route such as instagram indeed prominent youtubers such as philip defranco have spoken publicly about intentionally tapping other revenue streams which can include merchandise direct crowdfunding brand deals and other partnerships to financially underpin their channels frankie greek is a snapchat journalist who frequently speaks about these trends and helps brands make sense of them as a consultant she said much of creators discontent stems from how much the internet has changed in a short amount of time there was a time when the internet was in a way this counter culture underground thing frankie greekpeople are super resistant to change and there was a time when the internet was in a way this counter culture underground thing greek said now a network like youtube has grown into an enormous community and business model as much as people might think otherwise youtube is mainstream media now for her part greek says that

argentina avoid crisis talk after brazil beating as media lament catastrophe read more coutinho and neymar star for brazil to leave argentina flailing in qualifying read more well thats it coach tite and brazil make it five straight wins and argentina continue dwelling in their own downfall there was nothing about this match that should suggest they can do anything against colombia next week even if they are at home the entire brazilian squad energized and inspired by carlos alberto as he looked down from heaven delivered a performance that would make the legends of the extremely proud before this match the last time brazil played in belo horizonte germany had embarrassed them at the world cup in now they have a new memory edgardo bauza meanwhile has a lot to think about was higuan really the best choice to start where is the relentless pressure or the grit and desire we are so accustomed to seeing when we watch albiceleste answers better come fast because a hungry colombia is coming to town thanks for tuning in and ill see you next time min thats it brazil win convincingly a masterful victory min a great ball wide to neymar who finds costa but argentina just about clear it from the box messi who hasnt touched the ball in a while can only admire at his barca teammate and the way he leads the selecao neymar really is a sight to behold when he leads his nation messi finally gets the ball and dribbles towards the box but deflects wide min firmino hits the post after a great cross coutinho comes out for douglas costa a great performance from the liverpool man firmino again enters the box but otamendi just about clears it this is truly shambolic by argentina and ironically enough they could really benefit from another argentinian manager who instills a lot of grit and energy ricardo gareca but hes busy managing peru min firmino replaces gabriel jesus manchester city fans are going to be spoiled with the things he does a great no and hes only min wow neymar close to making as he breaks through the center and into the box but his second touch is too heavy and the ball goes out brazil chanting ole now and its going to be a long flight back to buenos aires min there are shades of the old brazil here with lovely one touch football i actually cant remember the last time messi touched the ball or even made a significant contribution albiceleste look to penetrate brazils box but a stout defense takes it right back min aguero gets fouled just outside the box but nothing materializes there are minutes left and there is nothing about this match that says argentina will get a goal let alone come back brazil look composed and really loving their football di maria looks exhausted and needs to be subbed min neymar and brazil are just having too much fun right now and higuan doesnt like it as he fouls the barca man argentina are losing the match and their heads on the process brazil in complete domination in other news peru is currently beating paraguay in asuncin first away win since i might explode after im done here just warning you min well this time around paulinho doesnt miss and makes it game over as he capitalizes on a cross from the right hand side this is huge argentina are losing currently out of the top next match is gigantic min wow this game should be over gabriel jesus once again finds paulinho who rounds the keeper all he needs to do is score and its over but zabaleta saves it on the line neymar gets fouled by funes mori freekick to brazil a great attempt by dani alves but its saved by romero min neymar fouls funes mori and once again tite has to warn his players to calm down brazil have taken on the high press approach knowing that argentina is rattled messi finds aguero but its offside this is bauzas biggest issue not being able to figure out how to encourage rapid movement inside the box min brazil start the second the same way they ended the first with relentless counterattacking aguero who replaced perez draws a yellow card as marcelo cant stop him on the right hand side another messi taken free kick this time a good ball in but cant be met by anyone min peep and were back well its clearly cruise control for brazil right now as argentina are getting rocked by the counter its all going badly for bauzas team im sure aguero will come in the second half straight away min what a great pass by gabriel jesus who cuts through the argentinian defense and feeds neymar who calmly puts it in corner wow min what a great cross by ms from the left hand side and it just cant be met by higuan who was too slow to react argentina are finishing this half strongly with all the action in brazils half they just cant find the back of the net thanks john ha ha you know what at times you would think that is the case but its due to the fact that alves and marcelo push so high up when in possession i agree with you a special goal question is my tv playing tricks on me or are brazil playing a john fearon via email min another free kick for argentina as messi gets fouled outside the box this is an almost perfect angle for la pulga but he drives it against the wall if it carries on like this it wont be long until we see aguero on the counter neymar takes it all the way into the box from the right hand side but instead of delivering a low cross he shoots it himself and hits the post min as argentina decide to press brazil stick to
in january donald trump will become president of the united states of america and the most technologically advanced surveillance infrastructure in the world will start reporting directly to him when edward snowden revealed the extent of the national security agencys domestic surveillance regime in he warned that a new american president could rapidly expand its scope overnight with just a simple change of government policy a new leader will be elected snowden said theyll flip the switch say that because of the crisis because of the dangers that we face in the world some new and unpredicted threat we need more authority we need more power and there will be nothing the people can do at that point to oppose it and it will be turnkey tyranny as in many other policy areas we dont yet know trumps plans for surveillance but better safe than sorry protecting yourself from surveillance by the nsa isnt easy but with information security technologies it is possible in fact its possible to fit the basic guidelines in a tweet like this from the pseudonymous security researcher the grugq the grugq snowden opsec guide use signal use tor use full disk encryption use a password manager use two factor authsolid basics november signalencrypted messaging has got a lot easier over the past few years particularly with the rise of encrypted texting apps such as signal developed by open whisper systems the gold standard of encrypted communications is still pgp an encryption standard first released years ago by phil zimmermann while pgp has the honour of being one of the few encryption systems that the nsa appears to have not developed a workable attack against it is also tricky to use with few good mobile options and a number of potential usability hiccups which can result in accidental exposure of information signal by contrast is very easy to use the app lets users add each other using their phone numbers before providing a scannable qr code for double checking that no third party has intercepted the initial communication scan each others qr codes and if they both flash green youre good to go you can use signal from then on like a conventional messaging app even installing a desktop extension so you can chat on the go if switching to another app is too much hassle or if switching friends family and colleagues to it is there are good alternatives in the commercial sphere both apples imessage and facebooks whatsapp offer end to end encryption with the latter even using the same open standard developed by signal avoid unencrypted apps such as wechat and google hangouts as well as apps with an optional encrypted mode like google allo and facebook messenger its too easy to accidentally forget to turn on the encrypted mode or get lazy and stop using it altogether and definitely avoid email and sms both of which are sent unencrypted and are easy to intercept use tortor once called the onion router is a technology most associated with the dark web the shady part of the internet that hits headlines for being full of illegal material but the technology was created ironically by the us state department to help activists in repressive nations communicate freely online and its effective for keeping all of your browsing out of the reach of prying eyes it works by parcelling up data into bundles which are then encrypted multiple times to dictate a path through a network of volunteer computers before reaching the final destination like a game of pass the parcel each relay node in the network receives the bundle and decrypts one layer which reveals the instructions for where to pass it on to this means that the destination server doesnt know where the request came from and the relays in the middle know neither the user nor the destination ideally the system is secure from eavesdropping tor hidden services which make up the core of the dark web are even more secure as the destination server is itself a fully configured tor node ensuring the request need never return to the surface web that means that an observer cant tell that a tor user has even visited the site at all let alone which particular tor user among the companies running tor hidden services are the guardian and facebook in practice there are more difficulties to using tor than there are signal for one the nature of the network will make browsing more difficult the limited capacity imposes bandwidth constraints slowing internet speeds while many sites uneasy about having users who they cant identify through ip addresses will block tor entirely additionally there is more scope for error with tor its possible to mess up and send some information over an unencrypted connection if you arent careful which can provide a fingerprint that an eavesdropping agency can use to deanonymise you in addition there have been successful attacks on tor which work by flooding the network with fake relay points in an attempt to control all of the middle nodes on a given connection if you are in a country which hasnt just elected a populist demagogue president you can help counter these efforts by setting up your own tor relays use full disk encryptionthis is easier than ever these days on a mac you will likely have full disk encryption on by default if you are running a recent version of macos check by going to the security and privacy tab of system preferences and clicking on filevault if its turned on youre good to go on windows its only slightly harder bitlocker microsofts full disk encryption feature isnt on by default but can be turned on by searching for encryption from the start menu clicking change device encryption settings then manage bitlocker and turning it on similar settings are available in older versions of windows going back to vista if youre running a version of windows older than vista you need to
in the long run i have hopedavid colorado a lifelong republican who voted for hillary clintoni am very disappointed about the result but i cant be despondent i am by nature an optimistic person so as the evening wore on and it became clear that trump was going to win i started thinking about what is actually going to happen after this in the beginning there will be dark moments and things will happen that are not good for our country or for the world im sure that the affordable care act wont survive for example but then i believe that the republicans will start to realize that they didnt really get what they wanted trump after all isnt a republican he has made that clear he just agrees with them on some things or claims to i think the first half of trumps term will go very badly for the republicans voters will become disillusioned and the midterm elections in will be disastrous for them democrats will probably end up with control of both houses of congress well get a new supreme court justice but im not worried about whether theyll be too conservative i would be more worried that they wont be qualified in the long run though i have hope i believe in checks and balancesdan california voted for donald trumpits done voted shortly after polls open on tuesday and i voted for trump reluctantly no disrespect intended to the third party candidates but a vote for an alternate candidate is in reality a vote either trump or clinton so i was faced with a vote for an incompetent or a crook i chose to vote for the incompetent in the end it wasnt the emails that sealed the deal it was the remaining hope that checks and balances would modify the impending chaos the system of checks and balances appears to be in position to better counter trump than hillary trump has already lost substantial support among the gop so he cant count on either the existing supreme court or congress to ignore him then there is the press what we see is a press overwhelmingly anti trump a vote for hillary means we can not count on the press to honestly and diligently keep the public informed of hillarys potential malfeasance nor at this point can we count on the institutions of government to counter hillary in any meaningful way so i voted for the candidate likely to lead us into the weeds without opposition the establishment underestimated the publics ragegeno pennsylvania voted for jill steinwell i think were all astounded instead of bushs predictable fifth term were facing nobody quite knows what i never thought this was a serious possibility until today but the establishment apparently made a misjudgment in underestimating the publics rage after decades of being impoverished to benefit the since the primary was rigged against the only semi progressive major candidate this was the next prominent way to give the democrats a well deserved heave im not exactly shocked at that but dismayed that so many of my fellow citizens still refused to look outside the two party duopoly or help the greens reach federal funding levels the impetus is understandable this is a rejection of the two party status quo more than an actual endorsement of trumps racism or anti intellectualism but the forces hes unleashing are volatile and damn scary as always the bigger struggle starts after voting positive change only comes from public action so theres arguably a better chance for it now than under a democratic president if theres no actual policy coming from the oval office theres space for saner voices to shape it itll be tough but at least the citizenry seems ready to seriously push back the campaign got younger voters surprisingly engaged and proved that candidates dont have to be owned by corporate money if enough ers remember the power lies with us we may have a fighting chance after all i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the worldsarah florida voted for hillary clintonhillary clinton lost this election because sexism enabled voters to perceive the most qualified candidate in the world as someone more reprehensible than bar none the most despicable person who has ever sought the presidency because the contingent of mostly older white americans overlooked empathy for minority groups due to their own positions of privilege because of voter apathy because we watched brexit happen and refused to heed its warning i am ashamed of how this plays with the rest of the world ashamed of my state in particular and dread what consequences it will bring the fallout of supreme court turnover alone will last long after his term is done it should go without saying that a president should not threaten the wellbeing of certain citizens as a main selling point in his campaign and my heart goes out to any individual who feels unsafe i know the cold fear you are experiencing the only way we can think to proceed is to brace for a prolonged fight ahead of us the man slated to be president has built his platform on harming the vulnerable and shouting over the voices of the oppressed if you find this rhetoric deplorable if you are kind then seize any opportunity to defy it do not wait to speak out until they come for you to clinton your loss is the nations loss i am sorry they were too blind to see the america im waking up to today scares memonica vermont voted for hillary clintonin my wildest dreams i never would have thought the public would swing so wildly away from reason as to elect someone like trump i grew up in a working class latino family im a liberal but my father was conservative ive been a single mom working multiple jobs to keep a roof over my daughters head and struggled to make ends meet
theresa may has congratulated donald trump on his us presidential election victory as the labour leader jeremy corbyn and his lib dem counterpart tim farron expressed deep unease at the result the prime minister said she was confident that strong co operation on trade security and defence would continue with the republican in the white house despite his presidential campaign pledges to pursue a more protectionist economic policy and isolationist foreign agenda i would like to congratulate donald trump on being elected the next president of the united states following a hard fought campaign may said britain and the united states have an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom democracy and enterprise we are and will remain strong and close partners on trade security and defence i look forward to working with president elect donald trump building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead no said may had written a personal letter to trump offering her congratulations the foreign secretary boris johnson also sent his congratulations to trump i believe passionately in the importance of the uk us relationship and am confident we can take it forward together he said johnson had previously joked he was hesitant to visit new york because of the real risk of meeting donald trump the european commission president donald tusk wrote to trump on wednesday morning to invite him to an eu us summit at your earliest convenience to explore relations for the next four years having previously joked on twitter that his wife believed there were enough donalds on the world stage corbyn said many in britain would be understandably shocked by donald trumps victory in the us presidential election the rhetoric around it and what the election result means for the rest of the world as well as america the victory for the republican outsider should be taken as an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply isnt working for most people corbyn said adding it is one that has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards for the majority both in the us and britain he called trumps victory a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened and said public anger had been reflected in political upheavals around the world some of trumps answers to the issue of economic instability and the rhetoric he used were clearly wrong the labour leader said i have no doubt however that the decency and common sense of the american people will prevail and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants innovators and democrats after this latest global wakeup call the need for a real alternative to a failed economic and political system could not be clearer that alternative must be based on working together social justice and economic renewal rather than sowing fear and division and the solutions we offer have to improve the lives of everyone not pit one group of people against another americans have made their choice the urgent necessity is now for us all to work across continents to tackle our common global challenges to secure peace take action on climate change and deliver economic prosperity and justice farron issued an angry statement after the result saying the continued rise of the populist right did not have to be inevitable liberal values of moderation freedom respect for the rule of law openness and concern for one another can no longer be taken for granted he said in the united states last night those values were defeated but those values are vital if we are to live together in peace prosperity and freedom those who still believed in a future for liberal values need to fight for them to win the arguments to inspire new generations to the great and historic cause of liberalism farron said never in my lifetime have those liberal values been so under threat and never have they been more relevant and necessary there is nothing inevitable about the rise of nationalism protectionism and division the election of canadas prime minister justin trudeau proves that i am determined that together we must make it our mission to build that liberal cause the alternatives are unthinkable among other mps and politicians reaction was mixed in an emailed statement with the subject line caroline lucas responds to racist being elected us president the green party mp called trumps election a devastating day for women for people of colour for disabled people and for an inclusive society in the usa a hammer blow for the fight against climate change the conservative mp michael fabricant said he was hopeful of closer us uk ties especially post brexit given trumps earlier comments that britain would be at the front of the queue for a trade deal much angst being expressed by commentators he tweeted they said much the same of ronnie reagan who turned out to be a great us president michael fabricant the us vote and rejection of the establishment reminds us that there can be no watering down of brexit november tory mp george freeman chair of the prime ministers new policy board called the result a roar of anger at globalisation machine politics out of touch elites in a series of tweets freeman said the election was a test for the constitutional protections for liberty and democracy in the uk and us we all need to defend them he tweeted all in mainstream politics need to look harder listen better and think smarter about the underlying causes of popular anger and address them its clear were living through a genuine crisis of legitimacy sweeping western political economy george freeman mp reflections on trump victory

given the generally pessimistic vibe that has accompanied england at the start of this tour this was as good a day as they could have hoped for they recovered from a slightly tentative early session to gain the upper hand thanks to a beautiful exhibition of test match batting from joe root and moeen ali whose partnership was ended only in slightly unusual circumstances theres no point arguing with it lets leave it at that says the former of his dismissal in his tv interview just now indias quicks looked sharper than their spinners and with moeen on and stokes settling in england are well placed to put this match beyond the home side and a day like this probably deserves to end on an email such as this from robin hobbs on booze smuggling the old wine pouch disguised as a colostomy bag trick never fails if you hold any thought today hold that one thanks for your emails and company bye over england moeen mistimes a big hit off a full toss from mishra but gets away with it and gets one run rather than the four he sought for his century hell end the day on as stokes plays out the over englands day thanks to root and moeen moeen finishes the day on not out photograph amit dave reuters over england moeen is watchful to ashwin slightly troubled by one that spins in at him a little and then takes a single off the last ball of the over which is completed quickly enough for us to have one more over over england a late bowling change mishra for yadav moeen pushes him expertly down the ground for a single as he seeks to reach his century before the close stokes is now in the mood and a short ball that sits up and begs to be pulled to the square leg boundary for four is well pulled to the square leg boundary for four mishra responds by tossing up a googly that goes straight through stokess legs the batsman flummoxed good comeback over england who says stokes is holding out for the close apart from clowns such as me that is he advances down the track as if hes

raps stokes on the pad with one that keeps low not been many of those today but its not hitting his single is the only run from the over should the obo maybe adopt the pub standard of no discussion about religion or politics wonders michael avery that way we can get back to discussing old television shows and instances where you had to tell a barber they didnt do a very good job or cricket wait youre allowed to tell barbers they didnt do a very good job ive got far too much english reserve for that over england spin returns to the attack which england might be grateful for moeen flicks ashwin away on the legside for a single and stokes adds two more when a slightly awkward defensive shot is edged to third man hell be grateful for the close one suspects which is just under a quarter

an ugly frustrated shot from moeen as he flays and misses outside off stump at yadav but this boy can flay and he plays pretty much the same shot next ball and connects sweetly it flies over extra

about which ones you can smuggle into a ground then theres the interminable indie bands information i could go on but why bother one consolation is that cricket is one thing t is unlikely to affect as he barely understands even football a discussion about smuggling booze into cricket grounds is one i could really tuck into right now over england shami continues with the reversing old ball and he induces a rare unconvincing leg glance attempt from moeen who fails to connect as it goes through low to the keeper the bowler receives more mid over attention from the physio but gamely carries on hes bowling ok too if obviously not at the pace of earlier moeen moves into the by carving to extra cover for a single over england yadav continues and continues to bowl well varying his lengths to good effect at stokes whos taking his time to settle but hes grateful for a looser shorter one that he pulls backward of square on the legside for a gifted four id like to take this opportunity to agree with richard hague writes ant pease ive been reading the obo now for over a decade and this is the first time ive seen one digress even marginally from strictly covering the cricket and only the

a month ago i tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for president elect donald trump on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to others i couldnt pull it off there is a darkness about trump that negates that sort of humor a folly so bewildering an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its depths he has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever in saying so i am not referring to his much criticized business practices or his vulgar remarks about women i mean this in a purely technical sense this man fractured his own party his convention was a fiasco he had no ground game to speak of the list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short he needlessly offended countless groups of people women hispanics muslims disabled people mothers of crying babies the bush family and george will style conservatives among others he even lost glenn beck for petes sake and now he is going to be president of the united states the woman we were constantly assured was the best qualified candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time everyone who was anyone rallied around her and it didnt make any difference the man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the oval office whence he will hand down his beauty contest verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old order maybe there is a bright side to a trump victory after all there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him yesterday and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him he has pledged to drain the swamp of dc corruption and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task he has promised to renegotiate nafta and maybe that too will finally come to pass maybe hell win so much for us that well get sick of winning but lets not deceive ourselves we arent going to win anything what happened on tuesday is a disaster both for liberalism and for the world as president trump goes about settling scores with his former rivals picking fights with other countries and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and that we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne what we need to focus on now is the obvious question what the hell went wrong what species of cluelessness guided our democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our lifetimes start at the top yes she has an impressive resume yes she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this angry populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered fine tuning when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine facebook twitter pinterest donald trumps victory speech in full she was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a clinton victory would have moved every democrat in washington up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary matter something that was taken for granted had winning been the partys number one concern several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was joe biden with his powerful plainspoken style and there was bernie sanders an inspiring and largely scandal free figure each of them would probably have beaten trump but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party insiders and so democratic leaders made hillary their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the banks her fondness for war and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose hillary even though they knew about her private email server they chose her even though some of those who studied the clinton foundation suspected it was a sketchy proposition to try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a rightwing monster is to court disbelief if trump is a fascist as liberals often said democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop him not a party hack theyd chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats didnt mean what they said about trumps riskiness that their opportunism took precedence over the countrys well being or maybe both clintons supporters among the media didnt help much either it always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the nations papers but it was the quality of the medias enthusiasm that really harmed her with the same arguments repeated over and over two or three times a day with nuance and contrary views all deleted the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a cold war propaganda station heres what it consisted of hillary was virtually without flaws she was a peerless leader clad in saintly white a super lawyer a caring benefactor of women and children a warrior for social justice her scandals werent real the economy was doing well america was already great working class people werent supporting trump and if they were it was only because they were botched humans racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the republican candidate how did the journalists crusade fail the fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus they chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them they transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting what could possibly have gone wrong with such an approach put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery
thats it for this blog and the campaign our new york team is up early for a polling day blog us election voters head to polls as trump and clinton aim to make history live read more hillary clinton has a chance of winning the election according to a polling day email from the respected pollster nate silver thats up from a chance on sunday night so clinton has had a good run in the polls in the final days of the campaign clintons projected margin of victory in the popular vote has increased to from as a lot of you noticed nevada north carolina and florida flipped from red to blue over the course of monday we dont think thats a particularly meaningful metric because the forecasts are probabilistic clintons chances of winning florida increased to from for instance which is nontrivial but not an especially large change still we know its something a lot of readers follow its unlikely that any further states will flip to clinton in our final forecast as shes too far behind in ohio the next closest state its possible that florida and north carolina could flip to trump by tomorrow morning though probably not nevada where clintons lead is a bit larger who is to blame for not stopping trump sooner few suspects spared a mention in jonathan freedlands hall of shame they include the other republican presidential candidates such as jeb bush marco and ted cruz who allowed themselves to be streamrollered by a reality tv host and serially bankrupted businessman but also trumps trio of enablers rudy giuliani chris christie and newt gingrich those three horsemen of the republican apocalypse conspired in the lie that a snake oil salesman was fit to be president and destroyed what remained of their reputations in the process plus trumps running mate mike pence the defender of family values who has served as the running mate of a thrice married serially adulterous self confessed grabber of women freedland also rounds on the indulgence on a epic scale of the media and there are cameos for julian assange and vladimir putin and finally theres a dig at the us electorate some blame surely attaches to the americans who let trump keep up the bullying and the bigotry and voted for him anyway there is no escaping the fact that north of of the us electorate have been prepared to vote for trump despite everything that he has said and done one poll found of trumps own supporters believed he would start a nuclear war they thought that but were prepared to vote for him anyway none of them will be able to say we didnt know who is to blame for this awful us election

battleground states remain in close contention as weve been covering in this blog since early morning the fbis decision to clear hillary clinton over her email server has given the democratic

the white house and the word from the campaign trials is that the race is still tight heres a flavour of our latest news story the us presidential campaign ended on monday where the fiercest nomination battles began in the rustbelt as hillary clinton and donald trump spent the last hours of a bitter election focused on the countrys deep economic divide democrats gained a late confidence boost as a final series of national opinion polls confirmed a small but steady lead for clinton early voting numbers point already to record turnout among latino voters stirred into action by trumps anti immigration rhetoric but the continued risk of an upset that would send shockwaves around the world was underlined by state level polling suggesting several possible paths to victory also remain for trump he hopes to galvanise white working class anger over jobs and trade in the traditionally democratic manufacturing regions though also needs an almost clean sweep of battleground states including florida and north carolina to win outright sensing possible danger the clinton campaign poured last minute resources into the industrial midwest a region where she struggled against a

there has arguably not been a us presidential election with so much at stake for the rest of the world since the second world war one candidate stands largely for continuity signalling she would do slightly more than her predecessor to shore up the existing liberal world order her opponent is vowing to turn that order on its head jettisoning alliances and free trade agreements while seeking to cut deals with the worlds authoritarian powers if donald trump is elected on tuesday it is likely to trigger a foreign policy crisis inside washington as the diplomatic and security establishments scramble to discover whether he meant what he said on the campaign trail those who believe that the election talk was all bluster and that trump will tack back to a more traditional republican foreign policy once elected are likely to be disappointed according to thomas wright an analyst at the brookings institution in washington us election trump and clinton in tight race on campaign final day live read more my view is he is a more ideological candidate than we often appreciate and while there is a lot of bluster and a lot of ignorance on a wide number of issues there are certain things that he has been pretty consistent on wright said i think he is opposed to us alliances and i think he would try to withdraw the us from security commitments around the world he is anti trade and he would veer towards a more mercantilist system and he is pro russian he is pro authoritarian some believe that trump would be confronted with a series of resignations by diplomats and generals if he tried to turn these campaign platforms into administration policy if on the other hand hillary clinton wins the electoral college vote she will face the opposite dilemma how to distinguish her foreign policy from barack obamas she has expressed an inclination toward a tougher stance in syria and in europe for example but the wiggle room for a change of policy has shrunk with every passing week as vladimir putin has sought to create new facts on the ground in the last stages of the obama era more weeks would go by while a new clinton administration dives into an inevitable policy review however events around the globe may not wait that long whoever sits down at the desk in the oval office on january next year may be forced to take some of the toughest decisions any us president has taken much sooner than he or she would want us faces host of global threats during transition until next president read morenorth koreaus power and influence is being challenged around the world at an accelerating rate and nowhere more so than on the korean peninsula the north korean leader kim jong un has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a missile and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so yet they will soon it is also widely anticipated that in the next few years north korea will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us west coast former and current us administrations have taken the strategic decision that pyongyang should be prevented from reaching that point by force if necessary but the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next president clintons foreign policy advisers have signalled that she would focus on the looming korean crisis early in her term in office reassuring japan and south korea that the us will not abandon them and seeking to put pressure on china to enforce un mandated trade sanctions more effectively that may well not succeed leaving a clinton administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of dialogue with pyongyang and accepting its nuclear weapons status as long as it restricts missile development if that were possible it would alarm us allies who are already within north korean missile range american allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if trump reaches the oval office he has questioned the value of us alliances in the region and he has floated the possibility that countries like japan or south korea should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the us strategic umbrella if he sticks to that policy in office there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in north east asia and possibly beyond ultimately a trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a north korean long range missile he has said he would put more pressure on china to get tough with its neighbour and he has said he is willing to meet kim in the us on the grounds theres a or a chance that i can talk him out of those damn nukes failing that he has signalled he is quite willing to contemplate using the us nuclear arsenal if the weapons cannot be used he asked then why are we making them why do we make them china china tantalized by us election mayhem and prospect of trump as president read morewithin his or her first year in office a new us president would also face a direct challenge to us power in the western pacific the chinese programme of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the south china sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives beijing potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world us influence is under further threat by the rise of rodrigo duterte in the philippines who has threatened to eject us troops casting doubt on his predecessors agreement to allow new permanent american presence clintons likely policy will be to continue obamas faltering pivot to asia and to prioritise restoring the faith of us allies in the region that washington will help
the supporters of an open democratic internet funded mainly by advertising are facing some big questions about how their vision will unfold a freely accessible digital world where websites and social networks are open to all is the dream of many but critics wonder if this is desirable or even possible brands have shifted a huge proportion of their marketing budgets into online advertising in recent years fuelling the growth of the internet and becoming the main source of funding for most websites and social networks but while many campaigns hit the spot others can be irritating intrusive and irrelevant how can advertisers and web publishers make sure ad campaigns are effective and entertaining enough to pay the internets bills while ensuring online services dont disappear behind a series of privately accessed paywalls to discuss the future of online advertising the guardian teamed up with advertising technology provider appnexus to run a roundtable discussion the discussion was conducted under the chatham house rule where comments were made on condition that they were not attributed to the speakers to encourage a free flowing discussion a key point of contention in the discussion was how the internet should be funded one participant was passionate about the ad funded model largely it should be free it is a wonderful tool for accessing information for consuming information and for the distribution of brands but another thought that the quality of content on the internet inevitably suffers unless you have the resources to fund it there are fears that ad revenue is insufficient to pay for all the content that is needed for the web generally speaking the ad funded model puts a downward pressure on the quality of content i have no problem with subscriptions the speaker said adding there is no reason why it should be free digital advertising faces some serious challenges if it is to keep the web free one of which is concerns over the ethics of tracking peoples online behaviour without their consent the success of online ad campaigns is determined by the data that brands can access about internet users how old are they what are their interests are they male or female single or with children much of this data will be collected from cookies downloaded on to users computers cookie data allows web publishers to track users online journeys and observe the actions they take on different websites they can then use this data to helps them target campaigns to different groups the impact of data protection regulationbut the forthcoming european union general data protection regulation to be implemented in will tighten up data privacy and this some speakers felt could undermine the ad funded model of the internet the stringent new rules which force companies to get unambiguous consent from online users to make use of their data are expected to be adopted in the uk regardless of brexit some participants worried that the directives clampdown on using data could make it difficult for certain companies to operate on the internet or to run advertising campaigns some businesses may not survive warned one speaker the participants also discussed whether website owners relying mainly on cookie data are at a disadvantage to websites and social networks where users log in and give their personal details facebook for instance has in depth login information about users their locations names likes activities and friendship networks the social network offers this data to brands facilitating highly targeted advertising campaigns one participant spoke of an ad campaign for the launch of a new product where a strong creative film was shown on facebook depending on how users reacted to the film whether they watched it the whole way through or just with the sound off more messages were served to them and these were refined in stages according to each users reaction the speaker said this was highly effective as it allowed the campaign to filter out those who were not interested and to deliver relevant messages to potential customers another speaker said facebook allows brands to constantly change their online advertising as they receive new data about peoples likes and dislikes i really feel it is only since facebook has come along that we have had this opportunity to assess data very quickly and then tweak that data but another pointed to a recent statement from household products manufacturer procter gamble the worlds largest advertiser that it had decided to stop using facebooks targeting tools they had assumed it would be efficient to target febreze to families with kids and dog owners but it proved more efficient to go broad in the targeting p g said it was better to promote some products to everybody rather than paying for targeted audiences as everyone uses laundry detergents or washing up liquid tightly targeted campaigns are more suitable for very specific niche products some of the speakers were concerned that online advertising places too much emphasis on data and not enough on creativity and persuasion the use of data was criticised as the tail wagging the dog and there was a recognition that some advertising creatives believe data gets in the way of making good campaigns they feel the use of data depersonalises said one speaker who added the caveat that attitudes are changing i think people have got used to the fact it is not a case of either having data or creative it is about using both together there was a consensus that cookie and login data works best for hard sell campaigns encouraging people to buy now rather than for softer focus persuasive brand advertising retargeting a waste and speakers accepted that retargeting campaigns whereby a user who has visited a website perhaps to look at some shoes then has ads for that website follow them around the internet for days weeks or even months after are unpopular with users it is so frustrating as an advertiser that i am spending on retargeting said one speaker i am

so barcelona go back up to second after a terrific fightback while sevilla can take positives from the first half despite tiring towards the end the real winners were us the viewing public after a thrilling game of football that nobody bar the visiting players wanted to end thanks for joining me bye its all over and barcelona have grabbed a big win in a breathless match thanks to goals from lionel messi and luis surez mins a penalty shout from the home fans as umtiti hangs on to correas arm it would have been very harsh umtiti clears vitolos cross and time may be up mins sevilla win a free kick which is pumped long into the area but barcelona clear the hosts try to build from the back but neymar breaks down the right with surez in space he takes a heavy touch and rico collects it mins three added minutes the home crowd like that mins the frequent stoppages have taken the sting out of the game incidentally thats neymar messi and surez all in the book which cant happen often mins surez hauls down his man in an attempt to break through on goal and is penalised he should have been booked this referee has been inconsistent at best moments later he is booked for dissent after being manhandled by carrio thats the ninth yellow card of the match mins carrio is the latest name in the book for a weary challenge on surez surez brings down the free kick but does so with his hand thats his last act of the game hes replaced by rafinha mins a farcical interlude as the referee books messi for trying to put his boot back on without leaving the field he gets booked then huffs to the touchline spending a full three minutes waiting to come back on in the meantime joaquin correa comes on for sevilla replacing the impressive sarabia mins barcelona come back at the hosts and nzonzi treads on messis foot forcing his boot off and earning a booking mins mariano reads a neymar feint in enjoyable fashion setting up a charge downfield but sevilla tiring after their champions league exploits and first half endeavour run out of steam mins sarabia works hard to earn a corner but the delivery is poor evading the big lads who had come up from the back mins umtiti wanders far enough upfield to have a wild shot from the edge of the area this game has changed sampaoli is trying to change it back bringing on iborra for the fading samir nasri mins barcelona let sevilla off the hook neymar crossing for surez who fires his shot too close to sergio rico an email the home crowds been singing the tune from galas freed from desire says kri tulinius i wonder whos on fire and terrifying defenses in the snchez pizjun viettos on fire vitolos on fire or are they willing the club to sign will grigg mins ter stegen almost hands sevilla a lifeline failing to deal with an outswinging corner and getting beaten to the ball by nzonzi whose header bounces just wide mins andr gomes is on for barcelona replacing rakitic mins barcelona slowing the pace now after the thrills and spills of the first hour after sliding passes all over the pitch messi picks out neymar in the middle his feathered through ball is latched onto by surez who takes the ball around rico but just runs out of room and fires wide that would have been one for the archives mins sevilla have been a little ragged in this second half the passes not quite connecting this time ramis diagonal pass is overhit leaving vietto frustrated mins ganso summer signing and star of rumour mills is on replacing vzquez from the free kick nasri finds sarabia whose low cross has too much swazz for nzonzi to handle mins surezs pass to neymar is underhit and mariano intercepts before striding upfield barcelona are short at the back and digne hauls his fellow full back down earning a booking in the process mins sevillas unbeaten home record very much at risk now but perhaps itll focus their minds they have seemed unsure whether to stick or twist since half time sarabia gets two chances to cross from the right hand byline but cant find a team mate and barcelona clear mins barcelona have dominated the second half and after surez takes the ball from carrio messi charges through the sevilla midfield then picks out surez on the right of the area he takes a touch and fires low inside ricos near post this has been coming luis surez gives barcelona the lead mins messi almost stuns the home crowd into silence shimmying into the middle past several bewildered defenders but lifting the ball over the bar honestly he cant hit a barn door this lad mins moments before rami hacked busquets down trying failing to stop a counter attack the referee played advantage and didnt show the fortunate rami a second yellow card mins denis surez plays it forward to messi who tries to return the favour with a threaded through pass thats just too long mins mascherano has held the barcelona defence together at times and stops a sevilla attack with a perfectly timed block tackle on vitolo who was threatening to break free on the left mins surez who has come into this game like a wrecking ball theres an up to date reference backheels into the path of messi who takes a touch and curls a shot towards the top corner rico does well to palm it over mins sevilla grew more cautious as the first half went on and messis equaliser has left them in a tricky spot unable to throw themselves forward with the same gusto as in the first half mins another lightning barcelona counter with suarez bursting clear and finding messi who has neymar in space to his
anyone who has seen the documentary weiner may not have been entirely surprised that it was former congressman anthony weiner who threw a late spanner in the works of hillary clintons campaign the film charts in excruciating detail the collapse of a political career and ultimately of a marriage weiners laptop is now reportedly under scrutiny by the fbi lest it contain emails pertinent to clintons private server but if there is a movie sequel to be made it might be called podesta an avalanche of tens of thousands of other messages hacked from clinton campaign chairman john podestas gmail account and released by wikileaks in regular bursts over the past month has provided an unprecedented window on the inner workings of a presidential run there laid bare with all the brutal candour of a fly on the wall documentary are the office politics the egos the cliques the evolving attempts to package a candidate who admits she is not a natural political performer like her husband or barack obama the hoard offers insights that would not normally see the light of day until memoirs published years or decades hence the clinton campaign has blamed the russian government for breaking into podestas account and passing on the material to wikileaks in an attempt to help donald trump win next weeks election it has generally declined to confirm or deny the authenticity of the emails but podesta a veteran of nearly half a century of us politics says he has spoken to the fbi as a victim of hacking trump adviser reveals how assange ally warned him about leaked clinton emails read moreclintons handling of classified information as secretary of state which flared up again last week thanks to weiner has cast a shadow over her entire campaign and been a source of much angst at her headquarters when the issue first reached public attention in march last year podesta wrote of three fellow clinton aides speaking of transparency our friends david kendall cheryl mills and philippe reines sure werent forthcoming on the facts here the message was sent to neera tanden president of the center for american progress thinktank in washington who has a regular cameo in the emails she wrote back this is a cheryl special know you love her but this stuff is like her achilles heal sic or kryptonite why didnt they get this stuff out like months ago so crazy podesta replied unbelievable tanden added i guess i know the answer they wanted to get away with it facebook twitter pinterest hillary clinton there is no case in fbi email investigation videoboth tanden and podesta are unswervingly loyal to clinton but could be described as critical friends in another exchange in september podesta warned that the campaign has taken on a lot of water that wont be easy to pump out of the boat most of that has to do with terrible decisions made pre campaign but a lot has to do with her instincts shes nervous so prepping more and performing better got to do something to pump up excitement but not certain how to do that tanden assented almost no one knows better than me that her instincts can be terrible when the seemingly innocuous leftwing senator bernie sanders came out of nowhere to challenge clinton in the democratic primary there were fears of a repeat of her shock defeat by obama in tanden warned podesta against attacking sanders too aggressively just game out what that does to hillary she wrote in august last year when we went after obama she got killed for it reaffirmed all her negatives strengthened him we had no idea it was kryptonite for us to do that but it was i dont know if it was obama or hillary but its really something to focus group beforehand in december when tanden wrote in praise of the paris climate deal podesta responded can you believe that doofus bernie attacked it then in march this year clinton strategist minyon moore opined i think sanders is a rule breaker and has no institutional loyalty to the democratic party we should expect him to ignore the rules and persist in his quest to flip superdelegates despite overwhelming evidence that reflects his considerable weaknesses with the democratic base and no doubt in the general tanden meanwhile pulled no punches when clintons campaign hesitated over whether to condemn democratic activist david brock for demanding sanders medical records she wrote hillary god her instincts are suboptimal a stout defender of clinton in public in private tanden injects some bracing honesty that suggests the candidate is not surrounded by sycophants after the former first lady described herself as a moderate tanden asked of podesta why did she call herself a moderate he wrote back i pushed her on this on sunday night she claims she didnt remember saying it not sure i believe her tanden replied i mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter i know shes actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues it worries me more that she doesnt seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment the daily dump of stolen emails has uncovered clintons lucrative wall street speeches lists of potential vice presidents and potential campaign slogans fresh questions over a conflict of interest with the clinton foundation and alleged advance warnings of debate questions but there have been few revelations likely to alter the course of the race for the white house in fact just as wikileaks release of us embassy cables often showed diplomats judgment in a flattering light so the podesta emails have illuminated a micromanaged campaign operation with a laser like focus and little by way of ill discipline or even foul language the nerve centre is however all too aware of its candidates weaknesses and sensitive to media criticism and as prone as any other office to personality clashes terse exchanges and mutual exasperation the
once upon a time a long long long time ago small children might get told off for being loud or unruly or as we called it then disruptive now not so much in its cool to be disruptive its what every startup in silicon valley is straining to do its what airbnb has done disrupting the hotel industry as uber has disrupted taxis and amazon has disrupted bookshops and almost everything else two years ago i went to a conference in san francisco techcrunch disrupt and met many people claiming to disrupt many things including in one case socks but what no one anticipated was that though it may be convenient to summon a motor vehicle to ones home with a tap of a button or to buy things online while wearing pyjamas and possibly drunk it might also lead to where we are now november two days potentially before the world changes forever because donald trump is not just an over tanned reality tv star gone rogue he is not a weaponised version of lord sugar he is what happens when technology changes everything disruption wrote clayton christensen the professor at harvard business school who coined the idea is the technology mudslide hypothesis its how some scrappy little upstart like microsoft overthrew the colossus that once was ibm its how some small new technological breakthrough can have huge unexpected world changing consequences its donald trump the living breathing version of the scrappy little upstart that overturns an entire industry only this time its not an industry its democracy we have fetishised disruption governments have stood by and watched it take down all industries in its path the market must do what the market must do only now the wave is breaking on its shore because what the last week of this presidential campaign has shown us is that technology has disrupted is disrupting is threatening to upturn the democratic process itself the best most stable most equitable form of governance the world has yet come up with in many crucial ways it doesnt even matter who wins on tuesday because perhaps the best thing you can say about trump is that if it hadnt been him it would have been someone else its the opposite of the great man theory of history a misogynistic ex reality tv star is not the game changer here its technology two days ago the same hackers who took down twitter and netflix and the and reddit and cnn last week in the biggest attack of its kind that the world has ever seen started practising on a country computer malware had been used to infect inanimate objects in our homes the connected devices that comprise the so called internet of things and that its been discovered a bit late are hopelessly insecure it has harnessed these to create a gigantic internet destroying machine the so called mirai botnet and its honing its power last week it took aim at an entire country liberia a huge attack was launched against the two companies that own the only fibre going into the west african country bringing its entire internet infrastructure to a halt the worst case scenario that the hackers behind it are practising for tuesday when theyll aim their massed computing power against america this is everyday objects in our own homes smart objects intenet enabled toasters and refrigerators because this is where we are our toasters and refrigerators may be about to be used to subvert the democratic process of the greatest democracy on earth and if that reads like the most lunatic sentence youve ever read you maybe havent been paying close enough attention to because this is possibly finally the year when it hits home that technology is not just some cool titanium coloured gadget in our pockets its the facilitator of the degraded news space that treats facts and lies the same that has enabled thousands of twitterbots algorithms to scrape the internet for stories about trump and then retweet them it was robot accounts that caused trumpwon to trend after each tv debate and allowed trump to claim victory its how a man who hasnt set foot on the street for four years can with just his laptop create havoc in the critical last week of the campaign by leaking emails that potentially implicate hillary clinton julian assange has inserted himself like computer malware into the heart of the american democratic process hes infected it he is like donald trump the law of unintended consequences writ large in human form in we didnt mind the fact that the data he leaked was stolen here in the liberal press we championed it because it was stolen data that served to underscore our liberal sensibilities or at least mine and now not so much but then technology is neutral there is no left or right there is only hackers and twitterbots and year olds in macedonia who buzzfeed reported last week earn money via google adsense for writing made up stories about trump and making them go viral on facebook in a single macedonian town veles there are at least websites about american politics run by macedonian kids who make money from fabricated stories teenagers can earn up to a month by making up things about trump they dont care about trump or clinton or anyone else theyve just worked out what the us public wants to read and have found a way of serving it up to them whether its true or not the best way of making money via google is to write clickbait and the best clickbait theyve discovered the stories that are spread widest and furthest in facebook and twitter are stories about trump more specifically false stories about trump because in we read the news we want to read the so called filter bubble the means by which google and facebook give us more of what we want or what we already know our searches and
picture a child entering the world around the time that a new social networking venture known as thefacebook com is making its own entrance to the world it is and the child is easy to picture her parents have photographed their daughters first breath first smile first spoonfuls and first steps when she reaches school age she is snapped in uniform probably outside the front door and one parent probably her mother shares the image with friends the child learns to read write her name she wins certificates excels at sport when twitter instagram and later vine arrive her public identities multiply she starts secondary school in a few months this child and her classmates will begin to turn and perhaps create their own facebook accounts when they do they will come face to face with their digital shadow they may step into it easily or try to sever themselves from it but it wont let go this pre existent media identity because it has logged their lives from the moment they left the womb some will recognise their digital shadow but what of those whose online identity bears little relation to their sense of self or to the public identity they want to share for years parents have fretted about their childrens posting activities while continuing to post as they wish about their offspring is it time they stopped or at least asked for permission first do parents overshare pictures of their children on social media read moretoday these questions are on the minds of the children at kingsford community school in beckton east london where the and year old members of the debate mate after school club are filing into a classroom on the first floor slinging down school bags and glancing at the motion on the whiteboard this house would ban parents from posting about their children on social media the debate leader writes its kind of weird your parents are still posting pictures of you on social media someone says one boy malachi bows his head and writes a single word on his notepad reputation this is really about consent his friend says do i want to be seen by a larger broader range of people there is a loud hum of agreement and one girl raises her voice parents we dont want them invading our privacy because some of us the only privacy we get is through social media these pupils often discuss social networking sites their attractions and perils but this is the first time they have turned their scrutiny on their own parents and yet parents are the object of an increasingly aggressive interrogation this spring a mother from shropshire called out her sons bullying on facebook only for the post to go viral the criticism of her became so intense she removed it and changed her facebook page and phone number next came the year old mother from balloch scotland whose photographs of her month old daughter in tiny high fashion outfits attracted an instagram following that included khlo kardashian until critics claimed the woman was sexualising her baby she has since locked the account and gone to ground after her came the arizona father who nakedly cradled his naked feverish baby in the shower an image his wife snapped and shared before facebook removed it as offensive excessive sharing about your children has long incited disapproval but recently the disapproval has begun to acquire a proto legal tinge in march french police warned parents against posting photos of their children on social media according to social media analyst eric delcroix the children could soon be able to sue them for posting inappropriate pictures under the countrys privacy laws the treasurer of the uks human rights lawyers association leanne targett parker echoes the idea that it is only a matter of time before children mount legal challenges against oversharing parents you cant imagine it not being something that starts to develop within the next five to years she says i cant see how there be attempts at suing people for putting up posts that theyre unhappy with one day my hair was all raggedy sticking up all over my auntie put iton facebook i was so embarrassed icriedsome parents may shrug off the shaming stories and the professionalised sharing of family vloggers such as the shaytards the brataleys the ballingers as beyond the range of their own moderate social media activity but listen to the children in the kingsford classroom and it becomes clear how many degrees there are of shame to these teenagers even small instances of sharing can be divisive when i ask if anyone has experienced being overshared themselves hands shoot up but the answers are a long way from the public shaming that normally grabs headlines they are exactly the sort of infringements that many parents will commit without a second thought i was eating a subway chicken teriyaki eating that and my mum just took the picture and posted it on facebook one pupil says when i was little my parents took a picture of me being potty trained three weeks ago they posted it on facebook me on the toilet it was really embarrassing another adds i was with my aunt in the park i was wearing my scarf but i didnt have a pin it flew off and my hair was all raggedy sticking up all over the place my auntie put it on facebook i was so embarrassed i was crying i asked her to take it down but she said no it looks cute my uncle posted when his daughter had diarrhoea pray for her one girl raises her hand parents love to post things about you personal information that you might not like she says which kind of affects your relationship with them now when you want to speak to them about certain things youre worried they might post it her classmate erin stands up her team supports the motion on the
how do i become an agony aunt ive tried using social media but it hasnt workedas you are something of an agony uncle i am seeking your advice on how to become an agony aunt all my life i have helped others with their problems i have tried hard to find out how i can do this publicly i have started my own facebook and twitter pages but have been unsuccessful so far any tips or advice you could offer would be gratefully received jeremy saysid like to know in what way your facebook and twitter pages have been unsuccessful theres nearly always something constructive to be learned from failure but you have more than failure to guide you you say that all your life you have helped others with their problems so you must have some fairly clear ideas about the kind of advice that has been most useful adapting this experience to your online presence makes obvious sense but i imagine youve done this already as for the advice itself a surprising number of peoples problems stem from their failure to see things through the eyes of others they are genuinely baffled and often upset because a friend partner boss or colleague doesnt see things in the same way empathy comes naturally to some but others have to work at it however it can solve or ease a great many differences of opinion as a solver of other peoples problems yourself some degree of empathy is probably your most valuable talent readers say as someone who has worked in a counselling type role my whole life i would say dont in my experience the people who would actually be the best at this type of thing dont do it for a host of rational reasons or cant do it because theyre not journalists or famous journalism is probably the more reliable route because becoming famous is more by happenstance than design being a professional counsellor psychologist or psychotherapist etc may help you see the issues better but you simply wont have enough information to provide anything truly helpful momenta consider volunteering with an organisation such as the samaritans which provides training and support it responds to people who are struggling lonely ill poor in jail or at school anyone who wants to talk being an agony aunt is a niche role and one that is often as much about the adviser than the person asking for help id ask why its that route in particular that appeals pumpkindoge it is about having an appropriate background in publishing a reputation for having a clear thinking balanced approach to issues and a substantial amount of luck starterforten train to be a counsellor or better a psychotherapist itll take years and money but most of all you will be forced to question whether what you do is of any help onalongsabbatical write to yourself for advice if its good advice you will reach your goal if its bad advice maybe choose another path iamtherobotmanhow can i help my daughter to choose a career after she finishes sitting her a levels my daughter is bright but doesnt know what degree to take as she has no clear career plan we have discussed this time and again but she still cant decide she is studying for a levels in biology history and psychology and completed as levels in english and law she enjoys writing and has considered journalism but she is particularly interested in endangered species and greenpeace any ideas on how as her mum i can gently and diplomatically try and set her on an interesting path jeremy saysyour concern for her future is understandable and laudable you just have to be heroically patient its not unusual for those of your daughters age and stage of education to be indecisive about what to do next as the sense of pressure mounts often compounded by would be helpful teachers and parents wrong decisions can be made perhaps the most useful discussion should start with the sort of career she might consider there are some for which a degree in mathematics for example is essential but from the sound of it her interests mean the precise choice of degree course is less crucial her interests in journalism the environment and greenpeace suggest there is no essential degree subject the a levels she is taking are usefully broad and will provide her with valuable qualifications without being restrictive by all means continue to discuss her emerging interests but only if she welcomes such discussions if she shows curiosity about an occupation consider buying her books on the subject but take care she knows they are not intended as a covert form of encouragement even if she appeals to you to tell her what you think she should do resist its important she senses what she wants to do with her life and she will the urgency to do so is not quite as great as it seems readers say her college library should have a wide range of resources on choosing a degree course and careers information she could also take a look at websites such as prospects ac uk which suggests career paths and gives job profiles her mix of a levels could take her in different directions she sounds like the ideal candidate for a gap year not a jaunt to thailand or botswana but time out to try out a fewdifferent jobs possibly to join greenpeace and see what grabs her inpractice for most people the day to day realities of a job affect our enjoyment far more than the title or industry how much will you need to interact with the public how do you feel about eight hours a day in front of a computer how much does money or status matter these are best learned in practice and she can use her experiences to guide her choice the pace of technological change is so rapid and the global environment

there are only days to go before the us presidential election on november what are the latest polls saying for an election that is generating more passion on both sides than any in recent memory pollsters and pundits are offering scant comfort to those seeking clarity about tuesdays result most outlets continue to predict victory for hillary clinton but various models differ greatly in the certainty they award that outcome and various polling averages disagree on the margin nate silvers fivethirtyeight model gives clinton a chance of winning to donald trumps while the new york times sticks its neck out with an chance of a clinton presidency to for trump realclearpolitics polling average has clinton ahead by percentage points while huffpost pollsters average gives her a percentage point lead how have these indicators changed since james comey announced the fbi was looking into clintons emails again amid this dense electoral fog what is clear is that comeys bombshell last friday that the fbi is in a sense reviving its probe into clintons use of a private email server when she was us secretary of state has had a profound impact on the race it allowed trump until then mired in his own controversy over his attitudes towards women to swing the spotlight back onto his rivals perceived untrustworthiness probably as a result the republican nominees plummeting poll ratings have rallied bringing them within the margin of error both on a national measure and in key states such as florida and even propelling him into the lead in the bellwether state of ohio whats happening now about the fbi investigation is there a timeframe fbi agents are racing through emails reported to have been found on a laptop shared between huma abedin vice chair of clintons campaign and her estranged husband anthony weiner it is not known how many of those emails came to or from abedin nor how many might have related to clinton or might already have been examined by the bureau if there are any new clinton emails it will take time to work out whether they contain classified material so the search is unlikely to be completed by tuesday leaving this sword of damocles dangling over the democratic presidential candidate as americans go to the polls how is early voting looking more than million americans have already voted surpassing the million who cast their ballots early four years ago will this benefit clinton or trump theres no easy answer to that question given variations both by state and electoral group but there are clues the good news for clinton is that latino turnout among early voters has increased dramatically over suggesting that the sleeping giant of the hispanic vote might actually have been awoken this year by trumps anti immigrant rhetoric the bad news is that the african american turnout such a vital element in the coalition built by barack obama in his two successful presidential runs is relatively sluggish this time as is turnout for young voters the fall in black turnout could be especially perilous for clinton in swing states such as north carolina which has been identified by both candidates as a key target can early voters change their minds as trump has urged and have they been trump is trying to use the furor over the fbis renewed interest in clintons emails to persuade those early voters feeling buyers remorse to switch their preference now that you see that hillary was a big mistake change your vote he said on twitter making the same appeal at a campaign stop this week in wisconsin one of six states that do actually allow early voters to change their minds the others are connecticut michigan minnesota mississippi new york and pennsylvania some early voters have made use of this facility though probably not in numbers large enough to make a difference whats the latest from florida and why is the sunshine state so crucial florida accounts for of the electoral college votes needed to win which puts it on a par with new york and means it has fewer than only california and texas combine that with the states history of squeakily close presidential elections obama won here in by just out of more than votes and you have the mother of all swing states all modeling suggests trump must win florida or kiss goodbye to the white house although for clinton it may not be quite so crucial true to form the race in florida is looking too close to call clinton is counting on a large turnout of democratic leaning puerto ricans in central florida while trump is bashing the theme of the fbis investigation into clintons emails in the hope of riling floridians into backing him facebook twitter pinterest how does the us electoral college work how are voters reacting to trumps holding back of his tax returns trump is the first presidential nominee of either main party since watergate in to withhold his or her tax returns his only return to have been made public courtesy of a new york times leak suggests he may have avoided paying federal income tax for two decades his reluctance is deeply unpopular with polls showing that voters overwhelmingly think he should publish the records as do two thirds of republican voters and almost half of trumps own supporters but whether that translates into actual votes remains a moot point what about trumps other difficulty with female voters it seems that trumps crude comments captured on a hot mic about making uninvited sexual advances to women might not have dissuaded many staunch conservative women voters from supporters him but it has hurt him among white women voters generally who will play an important role in determining the outcome of the election ten recent polls show clinton with an historically high point advantage among women voters what last minute plans are there for this weekend with everything to play for both candidates will be clocking up serious

answer has never changed hes the best person i have ever met closing out her address in raleigh north carolina democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said that the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the hatred and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in history i believe americas best days are still ahead of us if we do what were supposed to do clinton concluded every social movement every economic advance has only come about because people going to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the affect of adversity it wasnt easy to get the vote for women it wasnt easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the civil rights act was enforced it wasnt easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down

to make sure we deliver on that promise clinton urged the crowd you can make the difference not only in who you elect but in the agenda that those people then get to work i want you to hold me

about communication between a server hosting trump domain addresses and a server owned by the moscow based alfa bank owned by two oligarchs mikhail fridman and pyotr aven aven worked with vladimir putin in city government in st petersburg in the early the slate story quoting a range of cybersecurity experts said the communication between the servers suggested it was human rather than robotic and that it was intended to be secret and exclusive in a statement fireeye said it had been presented with a log of the communication between the servers over a period of days listing the separate contacts the information presented is inconclusive and is not evidence of substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between alfa bank and the trump campaign or organization the statement said the list presented does not contain enough information to show that there has been any actual activity opposed to simple dns lookups which can come from a variety of sources including anti spam

whats the problem with hillary clintons emails clinton used a private email server situated in her new york home while she was secretary of state from to she has admitted that this was a mistake in july the fbi concluded that clinton and her aides had been extremely careless in their handling of classified information but should not face criminal charges the issue has dogged the democrats campaign for the presidency with supporters of republican rival donald trump regularly chanting lock her up clinton emails fbi gets warrant as comey told he may have broken law read morewhat just happened on friday fbi director james comey alerted members of congress to the existence of a new batch of emails he said could be pertinent to the investigation as many as messages were reportedly found on a laptop seized during an unrelated investigation of anthony weiner a former new york congressman who is the estranged husband of longtime clinton aide huma abedin abedin and weiner separated after weiner was caught in and again in sending women sexually explicit text messages and pictures of himself undressed federal authorities in new york and north carolina are investigating online communications between weiner and a year old girl senior officials at the department of justice expressed concern that comeys decision to inform congress would be inconsistent with protocols designed to avoid the appearance of interference in an election but the fbi director went ahead what is in the emails we dont know comey himself admitted the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant those mails with a connection to clintons server could merely be duplicates of emails already analysed or they could contain a smoking gun that compromises clinton even after the election on sunday the fbi obtained a warrant to begin reviewing the newly discovered emails the process will not be finished before election day what was the reaction to comeys announcement the timing less than two weeks before a presidential election drew harsh criticism from democrats and even some republicans at an organising event in daytona beach clinton called comeys actions unprecedented and deeply troubling her campaign launched an all out war on comey chairman john podesta said by providing selective information hes allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because comey has not been forthcoming with the facts the wider democratic establishment also weighed in four senators demanded a briefing from comey and nearly former department of justice officials and prosecutors both republican and democratic and led by the former obama attorney general eric holder signed a letter criticising comeys decision the trump campaign meanwhile was elated we never thought we were going to say thank you to anthony weiner the republican presidential nominee told a rally in nevada did comey abuse his power the nearly former officials criticised his actions in their open letter which was released by the clinton campaign director comeys letter is inconsistent with prevailing department policy and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections they said in another scathing letter to comey the democratic senate minority leader harry reid of nevada accused him of clear intent to aid one party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election reid wrote through your partisan actions you may have broken the law richard painter chief white house ethics lawyer from to said he had filed a complaint against the fbi for a possible violation of the hatch act what is the hatch act passed in it forbids anyone in the executive branch from using his or her official position to engage in political activity carolyn lerner head of the us office of special counsel wrote in the new york times five years ago at its best the act prevents people in political power from abusing their positions it prohibits coercion by a government supervisor such as pressuring employees to volunteer for or contribute to a campaign and shields the civil service and the federal workplace from politicking in july the housing secretary julian castro was found to have violated the hatch act when he expressed support for clinton comeys action however is less blatantly partisan and a case against him would be tough to prove in court the republican congressman trey gowdy told fox news on monday it is laughable that jim comey committed a violation of the hatch act i actually know what the hatch act is demonstrating a selective reading of the act he continued if the president of the united states actively campaigning on company time for another candidate to be president of the united states is not a violation of the hatch act then how is jim comey supplementing the record and telling the truth to congress a violation of the hatch act harry reid knows that this is not a violation so why did comey do it will hillary clinton lose the us election because of the fbi email investigation read morehe told fbi colleagues in a memo on friday he was aware his letter was at risk of being misunderstood but felt obliged to notify congress about the new emails after having told lawmakers that the matter was closed there have been reports that some members of the fbi were in revolt over comeys earlier decision not to recommend charges against clinton and that he feared word of the new email investigation would leak to the media leading to accusations of a cover up especially if it happened after november he therefore regarded going public now as the least worst option will these events affect the election result possible but not probable more than million people have already voted and there is little evidence of movement so
clinton campaign unleashes on fbis comeythe clinton campaign in full battle mode is seeking to deflect attention from the latest email revelations by pointing to allegations that the fbi director james comey sought to withhold evidence of russian support for trump for fear of influencing the election citing reports on cnbc and in the huffington post that comey privately urged against naming russia for allegedly meddling in the election clintons campaign manager robby mook said the move was jaw dropping and impossible to view this as anything less than a blatant double standard the white

the clinton campaign has accused fbi director james comey of jaw dropping double standards for releasing news of a fresh investigation into hillary clintons private email server while apparently withholding evidence of russian support for donald trump in case it were to influence next weeks election clintons spokespeople pointed to reports by cnbc and the huffington post claiming that comey privately urged against naming russia for apparently interfering in the election and hacking democratic email accounts with campaign manager robby mook saying the decision to hold back defied all logic the white house also aired more tentatively worded concerns about comeys actions and motivations while the guardian reported that the fbi director could himself face investigation for violating

the white house on monday highlighted concerns over the fbi directors decision to announce that the bureau is examining whether newly discovered emails may be relevant to its investigation of hillary clintons use of a private email server fbi director james comey may be under investigation for hatch act violation read morepress secretary josh earnest was careful to say fbi director james comey is regarded by barack obama as a man of integrity and principle but he also noted the importance of longstanding tradition and practice and norms and warned of the risk of communicating with congress earnest said one senior republican official already had suggested that his party was considering impeaching a future president clinton comey has faced a fierce backlash for going public with the new fbi investigation just days before a presidential election reportedly against the advice and guidelines of attorney general loretta lynch and other senior figures at the department of justice on sunday the fbi obtained a search warrant to begin reviewing the emails reportedly numbering and found on the laptop of anthony weiner estranged husband of clinton aide huma abedin on monday a spokesman for the office of special counsel indicated that the independent federal agency may be investigating comey over an alleged violation of the hatch act which guards against federal officials seeking to influence an election at a white house press briefing earnest said much that could be interpreted as critical of comey though he declined to do so explicitly the president believes that our democracy has been very well served for more than two centuries by officials at the department of justice and the fbi observing longstanding traditions that limit public discussion of investigations whether an election is around the corner or not he said it is clear what director comey has done whats not clear is what led to the decision nobody at the white house has insight into the decision that director comey made im not aware of any of the factors that went into director comeys decision to send this letter to congress on friday asked if the incident could affect the election outcome earnest replied we certainly have already seen some of secretary clintons harshest critics capitalise on this letter distort its contents to provoke controversy comeys letter to congress stating that the fbi is examining newly discovered information that might be pertinent to clintons use of a private email server as secretary of state has placed a widely respected fbi director in extraordinary political jeopardy earnest dismissed any notion that congress could be seen as an impartial oversight body weve already seen just in the last hours the kind of risk thats associated with communicating to them sensitive information he said theres one senior republican official who had previously endorsed the republican nominee for president whos let it slip that his party was considering impeaching president clinton even before shes been elected if shes elected facebook twitter pinterest trump whod have thought wed be thanking weiner that i think is a pretty clear indication that congress is not at all impartial and thats why many of these norms that apply even when were not talking about someone famous and even when were not talking about an election a week and a half away should apply the president believes these norms are important and worth upholding the press secretary was at pains to defend comey as an individual if not his actions in this case the presidents assessment of his integrity and character has not changed he said for example the president doesnt believe that director comey is intentionally trying to influence the outcome of an election the president doesnt believe that hes secretly strategising to benefit one candidate or one political party huma abedin has hillary clinton closest ally become her biggest liability read morehes in a tough spot and hes the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts including individuals who served in senior department of justice positions and administrations that were led by presidents in both parties but im just not going to be in a position to frankly defend or criticise the decisions that hes made with regard to what to communicate in public an emboldened donald trump has described the revelation as bigger than watergate but there is little initial evidence the news has upended the presidential race a morning consult politico poll carried out after the announcement put clinton three points ahead while a cbs yougov survey of likely voters in battleground states showed that only of clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her as a consequence trump claimed on monday that the fbi had stumbled across a digital mother lode and predicted they would discover missing work related emails that had been deleted from clintons computers emails i think you are going to find the that are missing he told supporters in michigan i think we hit the mother lode as they say in the mining industry trump urged comey to resist political pressure hes gotta hang tough because a lot of people think he did the wrong thing but he did the right thing he told the grand rapids rally i was not his fan but what he did he brought back his reputation it took guts for director comey to do what he did he added to chants of lock her up from the crowd trump has seized on signs of momentum to push into once safe democratic territory in the industrial mid west he was also due to speak in warren in michigan on monday before appearing with running mate mike pence in eau claire wisconsin on tuesday until his polling gap

three days ago james comey was one of donald trumps symbols of washington corruption and a law enforcer of the highest integrity to hillary clintons campaign on sunday the fbi director was the most controversial figure in the capital heroic to trump irresponsible to clinton and puzzling to nearly everyone comey has a long history of trying to walk political tightropes to varying success dating to the earliest days of his career clinton and trump camps duel over fbi director late email revelation read morecomey a career prosecutor who grew up in new jersey and studied religion and chemistry had his first brush with a high profile investigation came in after a stint with the us attorney for new york that year he joined a senate investigation into bill and hillary clintons real estate investments named whitewater after a failed venture they joined he remained in the background of an investigation that ultimately petered out but comey soon joined two prestigious prosecutors offices in eastern virginia and manhattan where he pursued high profile cases against identity thieves a top credit suisse banker and martha stewart in he was named deputy attorney general in the administration of george w bush becoming a dissenting voice against surveillance programs of the national security agency revealed in by the new york times comey later testified to congress that one night in march with attorney general john ashcroft hospitalized for an emergency procedure he raced to the sickbed to prevent the renewal of warrantless wiretapping programs which the justice department had determined were illegal comey arrived just before bushs top lawyer and chief of staff and ashcroft did not sign the renewal i was angry comey told the senate in i thought i just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man who did not have the powers of the attorney general because they had been transferred to me that night was probably the most difficult night of my professional life the next day bush modified the wiretapping program in those hearings about possible misconduct by the white house chief counsel and ironically missing emails from the republican national committee comey told congress he felt it imperative that the justice department stand outside partisan politics the department of justice in my view is run by political appointees of the president he testified but once they take those jobs and run this institution its very important in my view for that institution to be an other in american life my people had to stand up before juries of all stripes talk to sheriffs of all stripes judges of all stripes they had to be seen as the good guys and not as either this administration or that administration comey left the justice department in for lockheed martin the largest military contractor in the us and eventually an investment firm and columbia law school in barack obama nominated the registered republican to lead the fbi joking that the prosecutor was a man who stands very tall for justice and the rule of law he was confirmed as the agencys seventh director in a vote only kentucky senator rand paul voted against him over domestic drone surveillance and quickly took on a series of controversial cases will hillary clinton lose the election because of the fbi email investigation read morethough he opposed the nsas warrantless wiretapping comey has emerged as a steady advocate of us security agencies since the guardian revealed a host of programs in a system that gave the fbi access to a trove of data comey has repeatedly argued that security agencies should be given tools to bypass private encryption and took the fbi to court against apple over unlocking the phone of one of the san bernardino terrorists were asking apple to take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock he told congress in march its not their job to watch out for public safety thats our job the logic of encryption will bring us to a place in the not too distant future where all of our conversations and all our papers and effects are entirely private the legal battle ended in anticlimax as the fbi found another way into the iphone it has since said that the hack it used does not work on newer phone models comey has walked a careful line on race and police killings last year he said it was unacceptable that the guardian and washington post had better data on police shootings than the federal government but also dipped into controversy by suggesting a ferguson effect named after sometimes violent protests in ferguson missouri over the police shooting of an unarmed black teen may cause police officers to step back from their responsibilities comey conceded he lacked evidence for that claim which led him into an unusually public disagreement with the president who warned last year what we cant do is cherry pick data or use anecdotal evidence to drive policy or to feed political agendas since then tentative research by the justice department and a st louis criminologist has suggested the ferguson effect is plausible as an explanation for a single year spike in violent crime the director rose to national prominence in july when he announced the fbis findings in its investigation into whether clinton and her staff had acted criminally in their use of a private email server he concluded there was no evidence of intentional wrongdoing comey used a press conference itself a break from tradition and his original sin in one former officials words to lay out the facts at the time correct several false claims by clinton and castigate her and her staff for their extremely careless email practices he was then called to congress to defend his decision which ended months of expensive and inconclusive republican investigations facebook twitter pinterest clinton email investigation five key revelations from the fbiyou know what would be a double standard if she were prosecuted for gross negligence
so that is that bangladeshs win was a thumping one by runs with two days to spare history has been resoundingly made and its been an honour to tap out the first draft of it thanks for your company your emails your tweets and your good humour english cricket wont go down without a laugh heres our hot take on a quite astonishing test bangladesh claim historic test win over england as collapse ensures tied series read more man of the match is mehedi hasan mr six for who trots up with a glorious smile on his face and says im really happy he can say that again and he does my grandfather john de lisle was a county cricketer who spent several years in dhaka working as a jute merchant it would have surprised him to see bangladesh become a nation let alone a test team but i like to think he would have been cheering them on today test cricket has had a wonderful couple of weeks and to have a young nation doing so well makes the whole game stronger heres a story on it a great story bangladesh claim historic test win over england as collapse ensures tied series read more man of the series will surely be mehedi hasan the off spinner who took england wickets one for each of his tender years he was accurate tireless painstaking a real grown up england need to sort out the way they play spin and the way they deploy it alistair cook had three slow bowlers here but showed little faith in them and set fields that just gave away easy singles so history is made and history is invoked by phil our resident mononym to paraphrase admiral beatty at jutland he writes there seems to be something wrong with our batsmen the astonishing thing about this victory is not that it happened but that it came so fast england were at tea and cruising with ben duckett making an electric first test fifty the first ball after tea duckett got a daisy cutter and then mehedi stood tall and lured england into one of their all time great collapses they lost all ten wickets for in overs staggering stuff finn is plumb lbw and mehedi the teenage wonder boy has given his country their first win over england he may also have given the rest of the world a laugh but this win was no fluke and a drawn series is the right result over england target a pattern has already established itself for this partnership woakes takes a comfortable single half way through the over and finn uses his long reach to see out the rest if they can just keep it up for a couple of days england will be fine over england target woakes has been formidable for the past four months but this is surely beyond him over england target shakib was poor at the start of this innings but he has had the last laugh three of them in one over and that catch from mominul was phenomenal hey tim writes shammi huda the last decade has been tough as a supporter of arsenal fc and bangladesh cricket for the giddy highs there are always unspeakable lows every silver lining has a cloud but now welcome to tiger country great series commentary look forward to indian series me too but england may be dreading it ansar sees off one ball but cant cope with the next clipping to leg and falling to a superb catch from nominal at short leg that was james taylor esque its and england still need more than a hundred history is beckoning to bangladesh zafar ansari scholar and spinner has to see off a hat trick from shakib wit six men round the bat he manages it propping forward solidly rashid sent in ahead of ansari after his first innings heroics has gone straight ball stone dead and i am running out of exclamation marks rashid given lbw first ball and he looks a goner no doubt this time stokes b shakib flummoxed by the flight england sinking fast over england target we already have a winner test cricket again the suspense is delicious stokes survives saved by the flick of ball on glove which means he technically hit it you couldnt make it up given lbw he reviews looks outish stokes goes down the track to mehedi fails to reach the pitch of the ball and still lofts it over long off immense over england target when the hundred came up england were right on top now they are in a tight corner and a desperate scrap can stokes the dominant personality of the series so far dig them out stokes reprieved by shakib off his own bowling a tricky one falling in front of him but catchable over england target stokes tries to live up to that last point with a slog sweep off mehedi but its well stopped at square leg with the lights on bangladesh need to keep up this momentum over england target both batsmen are staying positive stokes will not go gently an email from phil who seems to have just the one name like beyonce with this first five batting order england will get slaughtered by india changes need to be made starting with ballance and moeen ballance for sure but that seems a little hard on mo who made a crucial at chittagong a in this series is worth a hundred in most places over england target woakes begins with a cool cover drive for three but if one more thing goes wrong england are surely sunk bat pad pop snaffle mehedi has yet another five for england are and bangladesh are now hot favourites an email from jake dodds a message from my dad that im happy to share as it demonstrates both cleanliness and humour just had quick shower lost wkts if you count ballance as
the latest furore over hillary clintons alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater confusion with little more than a week to go before voting day the fbis unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into clintons conduct may not be politically motivated but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged principally by the unscrupulous republican candidate donald trump despite this new firestorm stoked by republicans and rightwing media it remains likely that american voters will deliver a clear possibly resounding rejection of trump on november although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign climaxes clinton is ahead almost everywhere that matters and she is the sane and reasonable if uninspiring choice a trump defeat will be richly deserved as we have noted previously he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the white house his behaviour during a long raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign made that abundantly plain yet consigning the donald to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of trumpism this is likely to take a lot longer trumps platform was based not on thought through policies and careful analysis but on prejudice grievance ignorance and fear spiced with opportunism his unexpected success in winning the nomination despite the republican establishments hostility reflected his close identification with mainly white working class and lower middle class voters who like him feel angry undervalued and alienated while public figures such as barack obama trumps failed republican rival jeb bush and clinton appear to this constituency to be remote out of touch and uncaring trumpism peddles the delusion that the candidate is on their side again and again in ohio florida and elsewhere disaffected voters claimed that only trump could be trusted to tell the truth only trump would keep his promises only trump could make america great again oblivious to paradox irony history or facts trumpism projects a distorted vision of american greatness the trump doctrine decrees that a nation built by immigrants that became the most powerful on earth is so scared of migrant and refugee hordes that it must build a mile wall with mexico trumpism holds that a great nation that incorporated religious tolerance into its groundbreaking constitution and bill of rights must now shatter its own principles and deliberately discriminate against muslims to keep itself safe as general concepts trumpism makes an enemy of the other equates nationality with homogeneity calls honest critics liars and seeks to threaten jail or harm opponents it says individualism outweighs state authority as in the unfettered right to bear firearms but not perversely in the case of a womans right to choose abortion trumpism distrusts and fears foreigners it believes free trade international treaties and economic globalisation in general are loaded dice intended to rip off americans paranoid trumpism holds that long term allies such as germany and japan get a free security ride at americas expense trumpism admires the domestic authoritarianism and international bullying of dictatorships in russia and china vladimir putin is a strong leader standing up for his people national beliefs and way of life any inconvenient truth that contradicts this or other trumpist narratives is inherently mendacious part of a web of lies and falsehoods spun by the treacherous mass media conspiring with the establishment to dupe honest citizens and dont forget trumpism cannot be fairly defeated if it loses it was cheated for sure trumpism appeals to the worst in people cynically exploiting and fanning the anger grievances and prejudices of the economically disadvantaged the embittered uneducated and plain ignorant it appeals to base instincts to lowest common denominators its is political dumbing down writ large it is underpinned by a pervasive and comprehensible insecurity engendered across the west by post economic injustice and social division the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent unfeeling or corrupt governance fear is the common enemy but fear is trumpisms friend this phenomenon is not confined to america european countries including britain experience variations on the theme in germany and france concern about rising immigration has boosted hardline nationalists whose appeal and disturbing ideology extend far beyond the cathartic issue of syria in greece poland austria and hungary rightwing extremists evil dehumanising ideas about refugees migrants and foreigners in general have become a commonplace of political discussion in britain ukip provides a noisy echo chamber for some of trumpisms most divisive chauvinistic and discriminatory refrains if trumpism is indeed a transnational pestilence it would be wise to look for a common remedy but first the symptoms must be accurately diagnosed and its long term effects should not be exaggerated much of the political turbulence and iconoclasm witnessed of late in america and europe is the direct result of continuing negative economic fallout from the financial crash hard times austerity cuts high unemployment and low wages are the manure in which political aberration takes root but as history shows they sometimes yet rarely lead to disaster when economies improve generally speaking so too does the quality of political discourse ensuring all people benefit equally from such an improvement is the one certain antidote to extreme politics while protest movements share characteristics and aims it is also evident that they are not all the same as each other trumpism is an infection others can catch yet it is also unique to america before panicking about the advance of the far right and far left in europe commentators in britain and elsewhere should remember that when all is said and done mainstream politicians such as angela merkel alain jupp mariano rajoy and yes hillary clinton do on the whole get elected or re elected notwithstanding greeces epic upheavals the centre does mostly hold more than
by declining to put up an official candidate to fight the richmond park byelection the conservative party has shown itself to be cynical cowardly and rational it took the decision knowing that it is not a great look for the governing party to absent itself from the contest it calculated that it would be an even more dreadful look to field someone in the colours of mrs may and see them slaughtered which is what would have happened the chances of an official tory candidate winning in this leafy patch of southwest london would have been somewhat lower than a flying saucer piloted by elvis and lord lucan landing on the head of the loch ness monster there is no constituency in the country with a more intense concentration of rage about heathrow expansion and the government has just declared that it wants to multiply the number of planes flying over its rooftops the constituency voted heavily to remain within the european union and the government is embarked on a trajectory towards one of the harder versions of brexit a candidate in the name of the tory party would have split the conservative vote enhancing the chances of the lib dems taking the seat so cowardice and cynicism combined with logic yet this does not mean that the absence of an official competitor for the tory party is an unalloyed blessing for zac goldsmith the former conservative mp who is recontesting the seat in the guise of an independent once upon a time when he had a reputation as someone who was not enslaved to his partys line he might have been convincing in that role not now only a few months ago he was the conservative candidate for mayor of london moreover he made the disastrous decision not to run on his own terms but to be the frontman for a racially charged campaign designed by the tory machine both nasty and ineffective even his sister jemima khan was moved to publicly deplore that campaign only very occasionally in british politics have we seen genuine independents in parliament one such was martin bell the former bbc correspondent famed for his white suit who ran and won as the anti sleaze candidate against neil hamilton in tatton at the election zac goldsmith is no martin bell to see how truly independent he is we only have to visit the website of the local tory party when i checked there on saturday the banner at the top of the home page still featured his mugshot alongside the tory logo the strapline read supporting zac goldsmith in the richmond park constituency the video content is a stream of images of the man who is supposedly no longer a member of their party a statement by the chairman says that the association and its resources will not play a part in this byelection before declaring that individuals who are members of the association may well wish to support zacs campaign and they are at liberty to do so it then provides an email address for joining his campaign statements from the tory party nationally have conveyed their warmest wishes for his re election should he be returned as an mp it is widely suspected and he has not denied it that he will only sit as an independent for a while before after an interval he judges to be decent rejoining the tory party if words in politics retain any meaning zac goldsmith is no independent if he is re elected it will be a message to mrs may to carry on as you are it is a big challenge to run as a genuine independent because they cant usually compete with the money logistical capacity and activist base at the disposal of organised parties i guess the money is no obstacle in this case the trustafarian mr goldsmith has exceedingly deep pockets there is an issue over how much support overt or clandestine he is going to get from the conservative party will the tory machine feed him with voter data this is a highly valuable commodity especially at a byelection when turnout is often pivotal to the outcome it seems to be a legal grey area whether the tory party can gift him resources without it counting against the byelection spending limit or whether he should be expected to pay a commercial rate and count that as a campaign expense he starts with some significant advantages he has a well known name enjoys the benefits of incumbency and won a chunky majority of more than in the first opinion poll for what its worth has him comfortably ahead in an age that expects politicians to betray their pledges when they become inconvenient he may earn credit with some voters for keeping his promise to resign and recontest the seat if his party went ahead with heathrow expansion here though is a paradox this byelection may have been triggered by the runway decision but it is essentially irrelevant to the contest his lib dem rivals are just as opposed to the expansion of heathrow and unlike mr goldsmiths party they have always been united in their conviction that it is a terrible idea the lib dems who came second in the seat in and held it until ache for the boost in media attention and party morale that they would receive from a victory vince cable suggested that he might be up for attempting a comeback there but in the end he did not apply to be the candidate it concerns some lib dems that their flagbearer sarah olney lacks the name recognition and the experience of her opponent but that has not prevented them from pulling off byelection sensations before tim farrons party seeks to cast the contest as a referendum on the tory government and particularly its trajectory towards a hard brexit this makes sense if they are to see a national revival from their near death experience at the
as a fractious and often sordid presidential campaign reaches its denouement hillary clinton may be reflecting upon the grim irony that it is anthony weiner who has provided what could be the final miserable twist hillary clinton demands fbi give details on latest email inquiry read moreweiners predilection for sending sexually laden text messages derailed his career in congress and his chances of becoming mayor of new york city but his soap opera style re emergence in the hour of the presidential race may yet trigger the greatest political carnage of all his appearance comes in an election already defined by allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by clintons husband former president bill clinton and by the republican nominee donald trump on friday clinton called on the fbi to immediately explain its announcement that it was reviewing a new batch of emails relating to her after a review of her use of a private email server was closed in july then the fbi director james comey said clinton had been extremely careless in her use of a private server while secretary of state but said there were no grounds for a criminal investigation on friday he said in a letter to members of congress that the bureau would analyze newly discovered emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation republicans were quick to characterise the move as a reopening of the investigation into clintons server a description democrats rejected it was later reported that the new emails came from an ipad cellphone and laptop seized by the fbi and previously shared by weiner and his estranged wife huma abedin a top clinton aide clintons campaign and the obama administration have been left bewildered by the latest fbi intervention less than two weeks before the election with weiners involvement rubbing salt into the wound john podesta clintons campaign chairman said director comeys letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case but we have no idea what those emails are and the director himself notes they may not even be significant well oh god anthony weiner i should not comment im not a big fan i wasnt before he got in troublejoe bidenit is extraordinary that we would see something like this just days out from a presidential election vice president joe biden was more direct telling cnns michael smerconish in an interview broadcast on saturday well oh god anthony weiner i should not comment on anthony weiner im not a big fan i wasnt before he got in trouble weiner is being investigated by the fbi and police in north carolina over text messages sent to a year old girl in the wake of the latest allegations against him abedin who has herself been a target for criticism from republicans for some time separated from weiner she has continued in her role as clintons closest ally on the campaign trail once seen as a rising democratic star weiner was forced to resign from congress in after he sent a picture of his penis clad in his boxer shorts to a year old student via twitter after he initially denied involvement in the messages further pictures sent by weiner emerged and he stepped down at the urging of barack obama a redemptive quest to become mayor of his hometown new york city gained traction in with several polls showing he had a decent chance of beating the longtime clinton ally bill de blasio the man who would eventually get the democratic nomination and win the election in a landslide however weiners campaign was wounded after he admitted that a self taken picture of his penis which appeared on the internet was in fact his weiner had sent the picture to a year old woman he made contact with after leaving congress using the now infamous alias carlos danger in his interactions with her in a statement at the time weiner said i said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have these things that i did were wrong and hurtful to my wife and caused us to go through challenges in our marriage that extended past my resignation from congress this behavior is behind me ive apologized to huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness abedin initially spoke in defense of weiner but the former congressmans election hopes were further tarnished after he admitted sending sexually explicit messages to several other women another low point arrived when weiner was continually asked what is wrong with you during an excruciating live interview with the msnbc host lawrence odonnell as shown in an eponymous fly on the wall documentary released earlier this year weiner refused to bow out of the race despite the anguish of his staff and abedin who often looked on in silence as her husband attempted to extricate himself from the scandal weiner was subjected to taunts from the public and became embroiled in a two minute argument with a jewish voter who had criticized his marriage to an arab weiner retorted youre my judge what rabbi taught you that weiners campaign ended in high farce the candidate was crushed with just of the vote and was forced to dodge sydney leathers a woman who said she had received sexual messages from him while giving his concession speech the weiner documentary showed the candidate scrambling through a mcdonalds restaurant to enter the adjoining building for his speech in order to avoid leathers who was waiting outside as part of a media stunt facebook twitter pinterest trump gleefully responds to new fbi probe into clinton emailsabedin who has become an increasingly public figure in her own right as clintons top aide announced her separation from weiner in august after long and painful consideration and work on my marriage weiner and abedin have a young son the split was expected to mark the end of the saga but in what clinton will
you know i still make bangladesh favourites theyve got a decent lead very quickly and despite mahmadullahs brain fade batting to come that has plenty of potential runs in it im off tobed do more work but do join me again at about gmt tomorrow morning for what promises to be a cracker of a fourth day cheers for reading and apologies for any tweets and emails i couldnt use bye ben stokes and zafar ansari help england hang on against bangladesh read more over bangladesh alastair cook is told he cant bowl finn in this light so zafar returns i guess this will be the penultimate over although the way hes taking his time could well make it the last imrul comes forward to the second ball and looks to defend but is nutmegged outside leg stump by the low bounce theres a sense of panic when he turns back and heads towards his crease but hes fine cook brings in the men from long on and long off to catching positions and the pressure tells the very last ball of the day brings the wicket england wanted and theyll be buoyed going into tomorrow bangladesh lead by with seven wickets in hand utterly idiotic from mahmadullah he goes for the huge slog sweep and ruins all his hard work by missing a straight one down go the stumps on the last ball of the day over bangladesh on sky mike atherton is talking about playing with his dog which makes me want to be mates with mike atherton all the more mahmadullah is playing a fine innings himself here scurrying and busy and moving to from balls with a clip to midwicket for a well run two and a push to mid on for one the comes up and we can start thinking about what kind of total bangladesh will want to defend another runs and itd be a corker of a fourth innings over bangladesh another overthrow after a pointless shy at the stumps by i think ballance it looks like hes been exiled to the deep for that one a googly out the rough takes imrul by surprise and takes the shoulder of the bat but theres no catcher in place twice the batsman sweeps and the second time it works beating the sweeper duckett and skidding away for imruls eighth boundary over bangladesh into the last over then which moeen will bowl imrul misses a big sweep and is very careful to keep his back foot planted in the crease with bairstow lurking ominously behind moeen needs to take a wicket to prevent this from being bangladeshs day despite that run ninth wicket stand for england er it looks like were carrying on of course weve had the minimum overs for the day its looking dark out there too over bangladesh john starbuck writes dan tms are reminding us that as the clocks go back tonight their official start time will be gmt so why bother going to bed those crazy irresponsible tms guys eh im opening up the obo tomorrow so ive just spent rashids over swearing loudly while barry glendenning and gregg bakowski laugh at me imrul moves to a fine with a reverse sweep that goes fine and down to third man this has been an excellent innings from the man whom some thought of as a jumped up odi player before this series over bangladesh woakes is off moeen is on with just three overs left bairstow who is getting increasingly irritating behind the stumps screams his head off for lbw against imrul who dug a full ball out with his bat about a foot away from his boot cook unlike mushfiqur this morning is not impressed enough to call for a review theres a better shout a couple of balls later when mahmadullah is hit on the pad from round the wicket but moeen turns away without appealing himself over bangladesh another call for a catch from behind the stumps but rashids leg break just looped up off the pad with daylight between bat and ball two singles from the over drop the run rate below five which is a victory of sorts for england the lead is over bangladesh two more boundaries woakes strays on to the ankles mahmadullah steps back and across and whips it fine for four to bring up the partnership from balls fine stuff that from the hosts whose run rate is incredibly still around five an over root incidentally is off the field with an upset stomach then four balls later woakes puts a half volley in the slot and imrul reaches into the coaching manual and pulls out the cover drive sara torvalds oi england needs a wicket what are you planning to do about that howzat banvengoctober out bowling over bangladesh nice shot from mahmadullah going back in his crease and punching against the spin to mid on for just one you kinda feel he deserved more imrul then brings out the reverse sweep and zafar comes round to save a couple with a good slide the bangladesh batsmen play that shot well getting across and right on top of the ball to smother the spin a leading edge along the ground and through gully off the googly brings two more then a clip off the pads lands a foot or so short of buttler at midwicket you are kidding me says a grumpy rashid and his mood wont be helped by imrul thwacking the final ball on the pull through midwicket for four over bangladesh belatedly chris woakes is introduced to the attack and mahmadullahs single takes bangladesh to with minimal fanfare imrul reaches for a full wide one and bairstow appeals for a catch behind but im not convinced he even believes that one himself given his grin he cashes in with a glorious pull shot from a waist high short ball and crashed through midwicket with a lovely woody
im mid and have stalled but how do i compete for jobs with younger people i am in my and have worked all my life in several sectors but ive come to a standstill in my career where im working for the nhs as a doctors receptionist dragons wannabe doctors as everyone calls us this of course is not true but why bother to explain it will make no difference i want a change but feel like im an old person in a new just out of school and willing to learn make a difference world how do i prove that i can be the right person for the job with my expansive work history over all these teens jeremy saysdoctors receptionists form a human buffer zone between two groups of distracted people the doctors doing their best to diagnose and treat multiple patients every day usually in minute segments and trying and often failing to keep to an impossible timetable and their patients often anxious parents with health concerns that make them more than normally self centred i can sense from your letter that the daily experience of being held responsible for circumstances wholly outside of your control has taken its toll that is all too understandable but you must try very hard not to let your sense of grievance show one of the most unattractive characteristics you can reveal in an interview is world weariness bordering on bitterness and cynicism no one wants to import such an attitude into their workplace and it will count heavily against you sometimes its not a prejudice againstolder people as such that works against them in stark contrast with the bright eyed optimism of the young its the way they can exude a sense of cynicism and hopelessness you want a change but the chances are that your best bet of finding something satisfying to do will have some connection even if slight with some part of your previous expansive work history think systematically of all the jobs youve done and all the different situations youve encountered and pick a couple youd like to return to and then just as systematically list not what youd want from such positions but what you with all your experience could contribute to them thats what any application you make must positively project enthusiasm real understanding of the specific task concerned and with an emphasis on what you believe you could bring to it you cant prove that you would be the right person for a job nobody can but you can entirely legitimately present yourself as a very attractive prospect readers say if being an administrator has been your primary experience over the past years then there are a great many senior administrator positions that you could apply for highlighting your extensive experience including customer facing work and the associated managing of unexpected events under pressure etc but you sound frustrated so take some time to work on your mind set fatherlarryduff consider a larger employer as you will have access to internal vacancies secondment opportunities and staff development be proactive about your skills gaps and focus on redirecting your career with energy determination and positivity therunninggirl i am and my closest colleague at work on the same management level as i am is and has many skills i dont have and recognises that i have some skills he doesnt yet have either we learn from each other id say treat your colleagues with respect do the job to the best of your ability and show rather than tell those around you your abilities if you have talent and are assertive you should be able to shine but dont belittle those who are different from you tacitanontacit wait until you reach your want to help people and work in recruitment but am always told that im too nicei have worked in the relentless business of employment advice so long that i have become disillusioned about what transferable skills i have ive dealt with customers who have been unemployed for decades and helped those with severe disabilities or that are suicidal and in need of mental health assessments i first thought that i could go into recruitment but after about six interviews i got told by every company that i am either not hungry enough or am too nice for recruitment my current job is not giving me the hours i would like and i am looking over my shoulder every day waiting for the boss to say well this is your last day they pulled the plug i have all the experience in the world but not one qualification to my name i have been promised qualifications left right and centre but when i have asked about them the answer is usually something about them trying to get the funding where else do i fit what else can i do i love helping people but recruitment thinks im not evil enough jeremy saysa bit like the reader before you show signs of allowing your disillusionment to colour your entire approach to finding agreeable work again thats completely understandable but if it becomes apparent in your manner it can only harm your prospects i doubt if your lack of qualifications is holding you back in feedback recruiters often cite an absence of qualifications as an objective reason for rejecting an applicant when in truth the reason was more subjective where the right job is concerned your extensive experience should more than compensate for the absence of more formal training i would strongly encourage you not to abandon recruitment as a prime goal the fact youve been called for interview six times is encouraging not all companies share the same hard edged attitude to recruitment and staff management that youve so far encountered you have long experience of working with the long term unemployed the severely disabled and those with mental health problems and still you love helping people please hang on to that central truth whatever

years trump says very falsely trump is distorting an fbi statistic into a false claim in september the agency reported that murders and non negligent manslaughter rose in the us by in the largest single year increase since that is not the same as saying there are more murders in the us than at any point since murders were reported in down from and highs of and there were more murders in than in the murder rate declined from to even though the population increased by a quarter during this weeks debate trump almost cited the statistic accurately saying we have an increase in murder within our cities the biggest in years the fbi figure is a national one not restricted to cities you dont hear that from these people he adds gesturing toward the press they dont want to talk about it you

who were brought to the us as children like obama she supports deportation for people with criminal records we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan this is only true if youre in the wealthiest bracket of american earners half of trumps tax cuts would go to the top of earners according to the tax policy center and most families below the top of earners would have income gains of less than trump doesnt linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of drain the swamp his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in washington forty five percent of african american children under the age of six are in poverty trump says inaccurately citing outdated data per politifact the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great recession but they have since eased to somewhere between percent and percent depending on which income threshold you use still the rates for african american children are disproportionately high so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on balance we rate the statement half true another two million hispanic americans have fallen into poverty under the obama administration he says also falsely per the guardians own fact check trumps use of two million is misleading on two points he starts counting from when george w bush was still in office and from right before the financial crisis peak and he ignores that the hispanic population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost million hispanic people fell below the poverty line between and census poverty numbers show but the number of hispanic people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in it fell to down from in it will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your heirs he says alluding to the so called death tax on inheritance though the estate tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of americans trump then moves on to saying that hes really moving in the polls and that hes leading in many of them this is not true as election models and poll averages show i dont know whats going to happen now trump continues so much is at stake in this election when we win in november we are going to have honest government once again hillary clinton destroyed emails destroyed iphones he then says without evidence that clinton put her office up for sale to corporations and foreign donors hacked emails show concerns within the campaign that clintons husband bill was too close with various donors but no one has found evidence of a favor returned in exchange for donations to the clintons charitable foundation trump moves on to reminiscing about how last june he came down an elevator with his wife to announce his presidential campaign he abruptly segues into saying

a melbourne cinema has cancelled a screening of a documentary on mens rights activism for fear it could be potentially damaging to our credibility following online uproar the red pill a documentary by film maker cassie jaye was due to screen at palace cinemas kino cinema on sunday november at an event organised by mens rights melbourne the film professes to take a balanced approach to the mens rights movement documenting jayes life altering journey where she would never see the world the same way again but it has faced backlash from members of the feminist community and has been criticised as unbalanced and in favour of mens rights groups the australian premiere was cancelled on wednesday after an online petition calling on the cinema to abandon the misogynistic propaganda film eclipsed signatures susie smith who founded the petition on change org said the film gave a platform to views similar to those of daryush roosh v valizadeh a self described neo masculinist whose planned visit to australia caused a stir with immigration in february this is the kind of disgusting violent message that is totally out of line with australian values and law smith wrote daryush valizadeh cancels neo masculinist meetings over safety read moreplease do not associate your cinema with the kind of people who teach men how to violate women physically and emotionally please stand with the women everywhere and do not promote misogynistic hate the petition was directly referenced by kino cinema in its email to notify david williams the event organiser and a spokesman for mens rights melbourne that the screening had been cancelled guardian australia has contacted williams for comment williams pasted the email above a rival petition on change org set up to stop extremists censoring what australians are allowed to see at time of writing it had more than signatures in the email the representative of kino cinema told williams that much of the feedback to the screening of the red pill assumed that it was a curatorial decision which is potentially damaging to our credibility as we are yet to see the film so cannot stand by its contents in the face of the criticism we are receiving a spokeswoman for palace cinemas confirmed that the email pasted by williams was sent by staff at kino cinema benjamin zeccola chief executive of palace cinemas told guardian australia on thursday that the decision to cancel the screening was made in the absence of any judgement of the film filmmakers or attendees however what was initially booked as a closed private screening was being publicised widely and this in turn upset a significant proportion of our customers who communicated their feelings to us directly upon receiving such direct feedback we realised that irrespective of the content its presence in one of our cinemas was offensive to a large section of our core audience and movie club members therefore we took the decision to cancel the screening aware that regardless of the decision we took a significant number of people would be disgruntled so we took the decision that we think was best for our customer base at that time jaye rallied against the decision on social media and called for one melbourne movie theatre to defend free speech and host the screening the numbers are on our side people want to see the red pill so why arent any australian movie theatres wiling to stand up to censorship she wrote williams told the herald sun he was determined to find a new venue to screen her film cassie jaye it confirmed palace cinemas has pulled the red pill a film they have not even seen read their letter here https t co jaye uninformed protestors bullied a melbourne theater into censoring redpillmovie but have signed wanting to save the red pill october jaye just need one melbourne theater to defend free speech and screen redpillmovie but they all saying they do want to invite controversyoctober told guardian australia she was very disappointed that a petition filled with lies raised the response it did and that kino cinema had decided to cave to these bullies demands rather than stand up for whats right im still hopeful that the red pill will find a courageous australian cinema to support a screening of the documentary and if that happens i believe that theatre will receive a lot of praise and support from the general public for standing up for free speech pointing to her portfolio of work she said she was a supporter of womens rights and gay rights i am not a mens rights activist even after making the red pill but i do believe in having an open dialogue about gender equality and thats what my film is about she said she told the website breitbart last year that she had struggled to find executive producers who were prepared to work on a balanced film about the mens rights movement we found people who wanted to make a feminist film though the film eventually raised more than us on kickstarter its release has been plagued with controversy much centring around one of its central subjects paul elam the founder of the mens rights website a voice for men which has published some deliberately inflammatory articles on domestic violence feminism and rape you see i find you as a feminist to be a loathsome vile piece of human garbage reads one of his posts on the site i find you so pernicious and repugnant that the idea of fucking your shit up gives me an erection alan scherstuhl referenced elams writings in his review of the documentary for the village voice the red pill he noted was screened in theatres mostly so that outlets like this one get tricked into running reviews that even if negative confer some kind of legitimacy i apologise for taking the bait he added david futrelle a chicago blogger who tracks and mocks the mens rights movement on his website
and you can read a full report from game here indians win world series game against cubs as kluber sets strikeout record read more email from len d this aint a good start remains to be seen if the goat isdead fingers crossed well see its a seven game series and a lot can happen but no doubt this was a huge victory for the cleveland indians also terry francona is now undefeated in world series games the more you know well theres a game tomorrow an hour earlier than todays game due to weather concerns a win there and the cubs have gone on the road which is what youre supposed to do another indians win well then chicago might start panicking well be covering that for the guardian hopefully youll be joining us thanks for following along with tonights liveblog especially those who contributed ciao cubs indians finalmiguel montero is in to pinch hit here allen falls behind it feels like with a run lead the mission should just be throw strikes but given the circumstances its hard not to understand if his command isnt ideal he gets the benefit of a high strike call on the next pitch his next pitch is a definite strike progressive field gets real loud and montero swings and misses at the next pitch and it gets louder the indians have won game of the world series cubs indians top takes ball one and then swings and misses at allens second pitch he swings and foul tips one into the mitt for strike two he swings and misses at a high fastball and thats out number two the cubs are down to their final out of the game cubs indians top falls behind contreras and then hits a fly ball off the wall for a double improbable rally time cubs indians top closer cody allen comes in and immediately strikes out baez the indians are two outs away email from don l stuck in cleveland without a functioning tv what to do get on google and find your coverage its great much like the early days of radio coverage when one had to wait while the announcer recreated the sounds of the bat and ball and the crowd cheering thanks for the kind words well be liveblogging every game of the world series here at the guardian hopefully youll stick with us and that goes for everybody reading right now wait hold on we still have half an inning left here cubs indians bottom grounds out and the inning finally ends cubs indians bottom the one time i praise one of maddons moves literally the only time this postseason and it goes completely wrong davis hits a double off of rondon ratings in chicago start to plummet cubs indians bottom hander hector rondon is up here to face perez franconas done no pinch hitting tonight i just realized rondon gets perez into a count then wastes a pitch and then throws a hanging breaking ball and perez hits his second home run of the ballgame cubs indians bottom is up with one on two out grimm falls behind him yeah this is the grimm i remember he lines the next pitch over the shortstops head and guess what we have a pitching change although in this case maddons in the right to make a move here cubs indians bottom brandon guyer grimm falls him but guyer swings through the next two pitches to even the count guyer checks his swing and its a full count now grimm misses up high with his next pitch and guyer takes his base cubs indians bottom hits a routine flyball thats two down cubs indians bottom grimm is still out there id imagine if the game were closer thered be someone else up also up is carlos santana whos uh is ready to hit a soul sacrifice no never mind theres nobody on base to move up in any case he strikes out badly on a unchecked swing on a count not so smooth right right okay im getting a tad loopy here cubs indians bottom the good news for chicago is that millers probably not going to be available to for for more than an inning in game thats not nothing it feels like francona might have leaned too heavily on his best pitcher but he knows the old teams that win game of the world series factoid cubs indians top gets ahead millers next pitch schwarber swings for the fences and comes up empty and on the very next pitchschwarber strikes out miller leaves the mound to a huge ovation cubs indians top with a sharp single bryant is at third the tying run is up to the plate once again chicago hasnt stopped fighting you have to admire that cubs indians top is up miller gets ahead of him the crowd starts to get loud again every two strike count with miller is an event millers next pitch is a ball rizzo fouls off the next pitch still millers next pitch a slider just off the plate gets called for a ball the crowd doesnt like it but it did break rizzo swings at the next pitch but he doesnt quite get a good swing at it and it ends up just being a wind wavering flyout that davis eventually tracks down millers thrown pitches already cubs indians top works a full count against miller getting him to throw as many pitches as possible might be the best long term strategy for the cubs at this point and he takes ball four cubs indians top is back out for his last inning one would assume cody allen is up in the cleveland bullpen he gets fowler to line out andrew m to len dnobody is feeling good about a team called the indians winning in hopefully their own fans are even a little bit guiltytheres definitely a conversation to be had about the
donald trump photograph mark wallheiser getty imagesdonald trump said today that hillary clintons plan for syria would lead to world war three because of the potential for conflict with military forces from nuclear armed russia in an interview focused largely on foreign policy the republican presidential nominee said defeating islamic state was a higher priority than persuading than syrian president bashar al assad to step down playing down a long held goal of us policy trump questioned how his democratic opponent would negotiate with russias president vladimir putin after having demonized him blamed barack obama for a downturn in us relations with the philippines under its new president rodrigo duterte bemoaned a lack of republican unity behind his candidacy and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders supported him if we had party unity we couldnt lose this election to hillary clinton trump said as they go to the polls in a historic presidential election more than six in americans say neither major political party represents their views any longer a survey has found dissatisfaction with both democrats and republicans has risen sharply since when less than half held that neither reflected their opinions according to research by the public religion research institute a former aide to republican governor chris christie reiterated today that a now infamous email she sent saying time for some traffic problems near the george washington bridge in referred to a traffic study not a political retaliation plot trump implied today that he would be willing to fight the sitting vice president joe biden behind a barn speaking at a rally in tallahassee florida almost precisely two weeks to the minute to when polls close there on election day trump said of a fist fight between the two id love that the year old republican nominee for president also labeled the vice president mr tough guy and said of beating up the year old biden some things in life you could really love doing fox news host megyn kelly and former house speaker newt gingrich engaged in an aggressive argument tonight over lingering questions regarding donald trumps treatment of women and how it might affect him in the coming presidential election with gingrich accusing kelly of bias against trump and kelly urging gingrich to take your anger issues and spend some time working on them im sick and tired of people like you using language thats inflammatory thats not true gingrich shouted i think that is exactly the bias that people are upset by i think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes sir kelly deadpanned what i said is if donald trump is a sexual predator then its a big story what we saw on that tape was trump himself saying that he likes to grab women by the genitals and kiss them against their will kelly continued referring to a tape that showed trump bragging about being able to sexually assault women with impunity because of his fame then we saw ten women come forward after he actually denied doing it at a debate to say that was untrue he did it to me he did it to me he did it to me we saw it with reporters people who had worked with him people from apprentice and so on and so forth he denies it it all which is his right we dont know what the truth is my point to you is as a media story we dont get to say the ten women are lying kelly continued we have to cover that story sir gingrich dismissed kellys assertion and decried the amount of focus paid on trumps sexual assault accusations you are fascinated with sex and you dont care about public policy gingrich responded and thats what i get out of watching you tonight im not fascinated by sex but i am fascinated by protection of women and understanding what were getting in the oval office kelly retorted its not about me its about the women and men of america and the poll numbers show us that the women of america in particular are very concerned about these allegations the former speaker of the house of representatives responded by daring kelly to call former president bill clinton a sexual predator which kelly ignored were gonna have to leave it at that and you can take your anger issues and spend some time working on them mister speaker kelly concluded and you too gingrich responded meekly the trump campaign swiftly responded deeming gingrichs appearance a success dan scavino jr newtgingrich just destroyed megynkelly shows she is totally biased against mr trump not very smart mr trump has long known october hillary clintons campaign has released yet another spanish language advertisement in ruby red arizona although theres no word yet whether clinton plans on visiting the grand canyon state herself families are complicated malik obama all i know is that my brother has done nothing for the kenyan side of his family i wonder if we are related sometimes october scott adams the author behind the once popular dilbert cartoons has published a blog post in which he offers his qualified support of donald trump but vows to assist in his assassination if trump does anything that looks even slightly hitler ish in office in a post titled the crook versus the monster adams argues that the public conception of trump as a monster are misguided but that if they prove accurate adams vows to join the resistance movement and help kill him calling it an easy promise to make adams continues i hope my fellow citizens would use their second amendment rights to rise up and help me kill any hitler type person who rose to the top job in this country no matter who it is what could be a more suitable ending to this awful campaign than a fistfight between donald trump and joe biden donald trump photograph jonathan ernst
