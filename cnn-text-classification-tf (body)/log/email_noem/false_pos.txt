monkeyball is on the steep decline people would rather watch a super violent show about a masculine white man destroying his enemies deadline even after one of the bloodiest and darkest episodes in the amc series history the walking dead really does have something to celebrate about its season debut and were not talking a fantasy sequence with million watching the october premiere to discover who negan would kill and million among adults for an rating the zombie apocalypse blockbuster had a very good night as the no show on broadcast and cable how good well twd knocked the stuffing out of the often dominating sunday night football demo wise this weekend left the season debut of big heavy hitter empire season in the dust and solidly bested its own season premiere last year add to that the show based on the robert kirkman comics basically matched its all time series highs of the season opener of october in both viewers and the demo and with maybe a slightly aging fanbase after all these years pile on that the season opener set a series high among adults making it clear that the walking dead is alive and kicking at this point deep into its run when most other shows are doa nfl ratings are collapsing completely awful announcing the nfls downturn in ratings has been the dominant sports media storyline of the fall of and unfortunately for the league its not getting any better especially when it comes to the primetime windows and while there are a number of factors at play in whats ailing the nfl right now the quality of the primetime games isnt helping in spite of featuring the games most storied rivalry in bears packers thursday night football was down versus last year the abysmal tie between the cardinals and seahawks was unsurprisingly down from last year proving that not all close games are guaranteed to drive viewership the monday night football matchup between houston and denver was also uninspiring and down from last year fox sports exec michael mulvihill has been tweeting out numbers throughout the season and through seven weeks now its obvious that fox and cbs coverage on sunday afternoons are being affected much less by the nfls ratings challenges than in primetime with all three primetime windows dropping this week tnf snf and mnf are all down at least in viewership from this time a year ago this is a massive drop massive though the kike media is coming up with all sorts of excuses none of them are looking at the most obvious thing that has changed in america over the last couple of years and that is race relations sportball americans aka the blacks have become insanely hostile toward the white population of this country so it makes absolute sense that people are now less interested in watching these vicious apes throw balls at one another nigga ah be botta frow dis ball over der dat oder nigga botta be catch dis ball din he gunna run ober der nigga nigga nigga fugg wite ppl muffugguh ah keel u nigga fu shii t the colin kaepernick hate protest against america itself which many of his fellow apes have joined in certainly isnt helping the situation any yes mr grossman please please take it to the next level i simply cannot express to you how much i want you to do exactly that as i have always said racial tension is good for the white movement polarization is always good for revolutionaries black lives matter is doing our work for us when white people see blacks rioting and attacking whites when they witness this hateful rage against them it triggers an instinctive tribalist reaction hence collapsing monkeyball ratings for their part jews are totally incapable of understanding the concept of going too far as long as there is room to push it further they will keep pushing it further and they are oblivious to potential backlash we see this with the sexual liberation some people would have chilled out once gay marriage was solidified but they moved on to trannies and now theyre headed for pedophilia because we are the underdogs in this race war against the kikes it is necessary to always understand and exploit their weaknesses they biggest weakness is this incapacity to stop pushing everything as far as it can be pushed this is why they were kicked out of over european nations territories and why they will eventually be rounded up and expelled from the united states of america look for rap music sales to drop next you can take that prediction to the bank the walking dead as implicit fascist propaganda okay so nobody liked seeing rick f that n last season i get that at the end of season i was working on a very long essay about the show and then ended up canning it because i knew there would be outrage over the season six sex act but even with that element the walking dead remains a type of implicit fascist propaganda due to the themes themselves it is almost like they have to include these multicultural elements in order to avoid open accusations of fascism the setting is one of survivalism during a zombie apocalypse where the only way to survive and protect your people is to be ruthless and the hero who began the show as a bright faced golden boy trying to help everyone is now an unrepentant mass murderer who will kill anyone who messes with his people if you ignore the racial element the show is utterly fascist as it denies the concept that jews have pushed in their media since they founded hollywood that the ends never justify the means and unrepentantly shows its hero a masculine blue eyed white male justifying the most violent of means to the end of protecting his people this is i believe why the show has been so overwhelmingly popular it
november chapel hill n c president obama threw the power of the white house behind hillary clinton on wednesday he faulted how the f b i director james b comey handled new emails related to the investigation into mrs clintons private server and then shouted out to college students here in a pivotal battleground state that it was crucial that they vote because the fate of the world is teetering mr obamas comments about mr comey broadcast early in the day as recent polls showed a tightening race were striking for a president who has insisted he does not comment on f b i investigations but mr obama appeared to be doing exactly that in implicitly criticizing mr comeys decision to send a vague letter last week to congress and by extension the public informing lawmakers about a discovery of new emails related to mrs clintons use of a private server as secretary of state we dont operate on incomplete information mr obama said in an interview with nowthis news we dont operate on leaks we operate based on concrete decisions that are made
cnns jake tapper hit the nail on the head last night as he was speaking about why people voted for trump tapper said that most americans are sick of the income inequality globalization and politics as usual that the status quo have given us he even pointed out that only a handful of people have gotten rich off of globalization and a lot of people have been left behind indeed exit polls last night showed that the economy was the number concern for voters the guardian reports its the economy stupid was a phrase coined by her husbands adviser james carville in the election and in many ways it ought to have helped democrats again in barack obama helped rescue the us from the financial crash and presided over a record series of consecutive quarters of job growth unfortunately for clinton many americans simply did not feel as positive stagnant wage levels and soaring inequality were symptoms of the malaise felt by many voters trump successfully convinced them to believe this was caused by bad trade deals and a rigged economy despite being pushed in this direction by sanders in the democratic primary clinton never really found a satisfactory response her volte face on trade sounded and was later proved by leaked emails unconvincing at best deeply cynical at worst similarly brexit the other recent vote which went against all political forecasts was largely a vote by those who lost out on the benefits of globalization that only a handful of fatcats really profited from leaders of the brexit campaign noted the confluence of the two votes jeremy corbyn described mr trumps victory as an unmistakable rejection of political establishment ukip leader nigel farage who went to the us to appear at a trump campaign rally said he was handing over his mantle as the creator of political earthquakes to the new president saying that was the year of two great political revolutions adding i thought brexit was big but boy this looks like its going to be even bigger n igel farage has issued this statement following donald trumps victory today the establishment is in deep shock even more so than after brexit what we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives voters across the western world want nation state democracy proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives i commend donald trump for the courage with which he has fought this campaign and i look forward to a closer relationship between the usa and the uk we now have a president who likes our country and understands our post brexit values prepare for further political shocks in the years to come voters in the uk and the worlds strongest nation the u s have both rebuked the status quo including neoliberal trade and economic policies whats next the rebellion will spreadfor example its so probable that merkels christian democratic union party will be thrown out on its ear that merkel is already trying to distract with silly claims that the russians will hack the german election postscript there are of course other reasons that trump won but the economy is the main one
