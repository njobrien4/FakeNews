email even amidst the bluster , lies , and anger unleashed by the presidential electionthe last of these captured this morning in a vivid photo essay in germanys leading daily , the s ddeutsche zeitung , i often hear the calming strains of one of johann sebastian bachs most famous arias , sheep may safely graze the first duty of the president , we are often told by the candidates , is the security of the american people in this piece bach presents a sonic vision of safety secured by enlightened leadership above a pulsing b flat drone whose static harmony conveys contented repose , a pair of pastoral recorders waft over an untroubled landscape this is artfully managed nature with no suggestion of the horrors of the wild , nowhere the menace of danger there are no armies or terrorists massing beyond the verdant hills when , after two bars of instrumental introduction , the drone breaks into a gentle gait it is not done to worry the listener but to lift the eyes and ears over welcome fields in just four graceful measures bach has painted an expansive , tranquil canvas over these bachian fields floats the soprano voice of pales , the roman deity of shepherds sheep may safe graze , when watched over by a good shepherd where rulers govern well peaceful calm is to be felt that makes a country happy ruling your subjects well is like animal husbandry manage the flock , be concerned , competent and watchful let your charges nibble and roam but never too far towards unknown perils we may have the notorious bundy gang getting let off federal conspiracy and weapons charges after its attempt at an armed takeover of huge stretches of the american landscape \( the rogues gallery of the exonerated is to be seen in new york times today is even scarier than the just mentioned photo essay in the s ddeutsche zeitung \) , but bachs aria nonetheless projects a pursuit of happiness that can readily be transposed from its premiere on february 23 rd , 1713 in a castle banqueting hall set in the green hills of central germany to the land of the free on october 28 , 2016 little more than a week before election day heard today , the aria confirms that what americans want most is a nice lawn a pet or two and to be left in peace in the three centurys since its first performance , the aria has proliferating in myriad transcription and arrangements , the most famous of them by the visionary italian piano virtuoso f erruccio busoni given the works graceful beauty , it is not surprising that in one version or another its a favorite at weddings having played the thing countless times for nuptial proceedings , i can assert that its popularity indicates that security and stability , not passion , are the enduring foundation of the institution of marriage , and in turn therefore of american democracy the aria texts praising male rule remains unheard in these instrumental transcriptions , and the wedding pairs remain blissful ignorant of it this best of bach track comes from the so called hunt cantata \( bwv 208 \) , composed for the thirty first birthday of duke christian of saxe weienfels he loved music , but even more , hunting , a proclivity captured by bach in his musical tribute at his own wedding the previous year , duke christians distant relative , the mighty saxon elector and polish king , frederick the strong , had had his jewelers , the miraculous dinglinger brothers , fashion a lavish hunting cup that he presented to the couple and which is now to be marveled at in dresdens famous museum , the gr nes gewlbe bachs music was meant to match this level of opulence and artifice , one which even minor german princes like christian enjoyed but hunting was not just a topic for artistic representation at the hands of a dinglinger or a bach it was a dangerous pursuit , especially since prevailing attitudes towards gun control and safety were almost as primitive as those held in america today musicians were not spared mortal danger the weienfels male alto and writer on music johann beer , who was also among the funniest and most prolific of early german novelists , got himself killed in a hunting accident with one of the dukes his colleague david heinrich garthoff , who must have known bach , came to the court as an oboist \( an instrument often deployed for accompanying the hunt \) but got his lower lip shot off while hunting birds garthoff was a versatile musician and became the courts lipless organist lucky for us , christian didnt hand bach a blunderbuss and command him into the fields when the composer visited the court for the dukes birthday festivities in 1713 , otherwise we might have been deprived of hundreds of cantatas , the goldberg variations , the b minor mass and heaps of other hits and only a few misses both countess clinton and sir donald are all for protecting the gun rights of hunters , so this is a movement both could get behind indeed , its any gun lovers dream , even if he didntor doesnthave a tenth of the arsenal of the duke at the arias start the obligatory horns fill the banqueting with tales of the days daring escapades taking down massive bucks beaten towards the hunting party so that the duke could dispatch these trophies to be at close range then the goddess diana , sung by the famed german soprano pauline kellner \( also likely anna magdalena bachs teacher \) , unleashed her own dazzling vocal firepower , shoots off a coloratura melisma on the very first syllable before listeners can even figure out what she was referring to , though the hunting horns have left little doubt hunting is the passion of the gods , she sings , following that blast with a line that would make a fine bumper sticker for a ford f 250 pick up on the back roads of upstate new york hunting is for heroes even if there had been rather too much of the above mentioned collateral damage among weienfels musicians , this is bracing bipartisan defense of guns and game while the aria may indeed represent hilarys views on the second amendment , she could use more than a little of the panache of bachs diana in getting her message out before we leave this hugely entertaining cantata lets listen quickly to the political lessons to be gleaned from the first aria of pan , the god of shepherds and a lusty rustic type who , like donald , you wouldnt want to sit next to in first class bach makes his pan a fun loving , loose cannon of a bass , who goes off half cocked claiming that he would make a worthy leader like bill clinton and donald trump , this libertine purports to have great erotic powers , and it can only be assumed he thinks these will help him as head of state a pair of brash oboes starts bragging even before the voice enters , making the absurd claim that a prince is the pan of his country the bass sounds off through a lurching gigue that suggests too much drink after his opening comic comparison , one about as funny as imagining donald trump in the oval office , pan goes on to make a decent point of political theory , though hardly an original one since the analogy between a ruler less country and a headless body politic was a trope of the time just as the body without the soul cannot live or control itself , so a country is a cave of death when it no longer has a head and prince and therefore lacks its best part pan holds resolutely to long notes on live and rule but then tumbles drunkenly down from them as he runs out of breath on entering the mortal cavern with its minor shadows and chromatic crags , the drunk goes dark , only brightening just before the close when he remembers that he is after all the best partthe happy head to the nations body its a raucous , rambling stump speech worthy of you know who sumptuous entertainments like this cantata drained the ducal coffers in weienfels such that many of the courts musiciansincluding some of bachs own in lawswere eventually owed years of unpaid salary as a result , the duchy was dissolved by the higher up royals in dresden even the marital hunting cup came back to the giver if you believe the gun loving trump , a similar fate awaits the americans once the chinese debt holders come callingand not just to bag a couple of big horn sheep for their trophy wall
email it was fifty four years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by isaac babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry \( the title of babels collection of short stories written when the jew and former menshevik was imbedded with pro revolution cossacks \) had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones for the backward peasants , this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a decade , being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time being , however , they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of peace , bread and land it was the assault on the gentrys land that for the time being assuaged the peasants responding to an aggrieved muzhik \( peasant \) , dyakov , the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as red faced with a gray mustache , a black cape , and wide red tatar trousers with silver stripes , promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the muzhik cried out , lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get up \? its on its last legs ! dyakovs ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like jesus raising lazarus from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he wrote you are insulting this horse , my dear fellow ! dyakov answered with fierce conviction pure blasphemy , my dear fellow ! and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus ring , he stretched his magnificent legs , his trousers girded by cords around the knees , and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a severe , penetrating eye , licked some invisible command from his crimson palm , and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this sprightly , gray , blossoming romeo her muzzle lolling , her legs skidding under her , feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious impatience , the mare slowly and deliberate1y rose onto her legs and then we all saw dyakovs slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty mane , and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body shivering , the mare stood on four legs without moving her timid , doglike , lovestruck eyes from dyakov so you see this is a horse , dyakov said to the muzhik , and added softly , and you were complaining , my dearest of friends ! throwing his reins to his orderly , the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap and , swirling off his operatic cloak , disappeared into the headquarters today , reading this story once again for the first time in fifty four years , i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like ezra pound , james joyce and thomas mann , he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early 60s i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse my early connections to modernism and my later connections to marxism that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early 60s converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on october 28 th at the cinema village in new york directed by david novack , who has a background as a sound engineer , it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of ukraine today as a possible trigger of wwiii according to some , babels multiple identity as jew , ukrainian , communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by andrei malaev babel , who is the grandson of isaac babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of florida , to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work isaac babel was executed for treason in 1940 , having been charged with belonging to a trotskyist group and spying for france and austria babels wife antonina pirozhkova , who died at the age of 101 in 2010 , is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in 1939 , the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new york times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering degree , she helped to design the moscow subway system the obit notes ms pirozhkova recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading habits , which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director sergei m eisenstein and visits by foreign luminaries like andr gide and andr malraux it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original russian revolution rather than to fall in line as a stalin toady as he travels around ukraine , malaev babel encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for odessa tales , another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in 1923 and 1924 , the stories focus on jewish gangsters living in moldavanka , an odessa slum , hardly the material youd expect to find written by a partisan of the russian revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to terences observation homo sum , humani nihil a me alienum puto , or i am human , and nothing of that which is human is alien to me although i have never read odessa tales , i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather probably knew in byelorussia and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the usa unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in sullivan county in upstate ny , abe kid twist reles and other members of murder incorporated only saw the borscht belt as a place where they could dump their victims in swan lake , about fifteen minutes from my home town throughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by liev schreiber that will be a good introduction to babels literary power there are also interviews with some leading babel scholars including stanford professor gregory freidin who spent a day traveling around paris with malaev babel to see places where babel lived for a few years before returning to russia we learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of stalins countless victims by living in exile , he was too attached to russian culture and language to live abroad while in paris , babel wrote a play titled maria that likely put him on stalins shit list although being a free thinking intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start with his theater background , malaev babel is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including marina vlady , an acclaimed russian french actress , who reads a letter from the titular character in 2003 , gregory freidin mounted a production of maria at stanford university the plays program describes major character isaac dymshit , a jewish gangster , as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution she , like the young babel , served in the red cavalry never seen on stage , we only hear from maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five it begins at dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me by eight i have to be in the political propaganda division , im in charge therei edit the articles of the divisional newspaper , i run the literacy classes our reinforcements are all ukrainians they remind me of italians , the way they talk and act russia has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries in our house in petersburg , opposite the hermitage and the winter palace , we might as well have been living in polynesia for we knew any thing at all about our people ! it is writing lines like this that got babel killed rather than spying for france or austria babel was a friend and protg of maxim gorky , who remained a diehard stalinist despite sharing babels inclination for writing about the lower depths of russian society he was deeply troubled by how maria depicted political corruption , prosecution of the innocent , and black marketeering within soviet society gorky accused babel of having a baudelairean predilection for rotting meat apparently gorky had forgotten that baudelaire was marxs favorite novelist david novack , the director of finding babel has a connection to odessa but not to its legendary jewish gangsters he has an ancestor named david nowakowsky who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there in an interview given to the odessa review , novack sums up isaac babels relationship to the soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left as someone with roots in the existential outsider world of the 1960s that saw albert camus as its most eloquent spokesmen , i never found myself comfortable with the trotskyist milieu that fostered cultish obedience to the genius leader to this day , it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland i think that novacks description of babels insider outsider sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the left babel represented the insider outsider , thats what he was he got himself all the way inside , up to the upper levels of the nkvd up to beria who ended up supervising his torture in the end , personally i dont know if he was in the room , but he had an office in the st catharines monastery where babel was tortured that monastery was being used as a torture prison , the sukhanovo prison , which we note in the film , we visited it he got himself as close to the flame as possible as an insider , but yet he was an outsider because he was from odessa , he was jewish he should not even have been permitted to study under gorky which is where he really honed his skills the only reason that he was able to study under gorky is that he smuggled himself illegally to st petersburg when he wasnt allowed to be there , because it was outside the settlement area for jews so babel was an outsider he then found himself with red calvary with the cossacks in the red army , running through western ukraine as he documented brutality against the ukrainians and the jews brutality brought on by both sides , it was a civil war essentially between the reds and the poles who suffered the most \? the jews and the ukrainians , the peasantry are the ones who suffered the most in that conflict there he was again , the outsider insider its from this very unique perspective where all his writing came from

so the band has done it finally , a group of like minded individuals has started to write music and playing shows it is exciting , corralling friends and family in a crowded bar and blasting them with the sonic abilities of the new band maybe members of the musical group have started posting flyers and setting up a facebook , reverbnation , soundcloud , and even a twitter account at some point , however , being a good band is not enough to bring in new fans all musical groups arrive at the crossroads where they have to make a decision on where to record their music history of the recording industry there are many options today , compared to the recording industry 10 years ago in previous years , there were not many choices there were a handful of studios that catered to any genres , all bands , and solo artists the quality was top of the line , however , it was expensive to record , especially for starving artists but now , with the digital age , things have changed it seems that anyone can stumble upon dozens of small studios within the area nevertheless , among all the choices , who can be trusted with original music \? and even more important , what is the right balance of expense and quality \? before digital recording became the industry standard , everything was done on reels or with adat hardware , and it was expensive to produce an album that is no longer the case for less than 1 , 000 , with a little bit of practice and creativity , a creative music studio can be set up at home is this really the right option for artists today \? the answer is simple maybe , sort of , possibly some artists might look forward to tirelessly editing track after track to make that perfect cut however , they might be robbing the band of the actual gains from a musical engineer sometimes having an unbiased ear that is not married to the guitar player is the insight needed to turn a song from mediocre to a hit most musicians forget this factor when they begin building a studio for themselves recording options part of the price of using a professional studio is the benefit of an engineer who cares about the project and offers a new , creative element to a song the band has been playing for the last few years if the group decides not to purchase an m box , pro tools set up for 500 , and learn the engineering side of things , there is still that big question which is the right studio for the band \? larger studios will always be able to craft great sound with their resources , they can stay up to date on new software , some programs cost as much as 10 , 000 , and have access to the newest and hottest electronic toys on the market however , most musicians are worried that while larger , more professional studios can produce great sound , will it be an accurate representation of the groups style and be reproducible studios that have access to all the gear and software to produce great sounding demos or albums can do so because of their sheer volume of customers they may not be unable to give every project the time it deserves also , musicians may find themselves bound to a setting where the engineer does not even listen to the genre the band is playing , or maybe even hates it some musicians feel that paying someone to care , is not enough to put their dreams in someone elses hands so , it the studio is not the right option , then what \? with the digital age and loads of free software like reaper and garage band , smaller , home studios have blown up all over it seems like anyone with a handful of microphones and a computer is a self proclaimed engineer producer they can be found on craigslist , through referrals from fellow musicians , or maybe it is even a best buddy from grade school still , are these small studios going to have the talent to take the band to the next level \? what to look for when reviewing a small studio is the engineer running the studio out of his living room or worse , his parents garage \? after all , how can someone , who wants to charge money , not able to afford an actual place to work , and more importantly , create the desired sound \? smaller places like this may be significantly cheaper but may not have the resources necessary to produce the desired sound , regardless if they are a fan of the band and style is the engineer qualified \? has he she gone to school or been involved in an apprenticeship program \? what makes them qualified to produce an album \? \( that being said , there are many famous people who have fantastic talents behind the mic and the glass \) the lowest price in the world is not worth anything if the group signs up to record with a producer who has little or no idea what they are doing listened to previous work they have recorded have they produced anything like the genre and sound of the band \? what is the quality of their work \? there is no right answer when looking for the perfect studio for a project , but there are plenty of options whether it be a local staple studio , a smaller less expensive place , or create a home studio , there is one thing that is almost guaranteed to happen most musicians will never be satisfied with their recording maybe the drummer could have done this differently , the singer was sick , or a guitar player was just a fraction out of tune most likely , while dissecting the demo or album , after thousands of playbacks , some sort of imperfection will be discovered hopefully , it is something fans will not notice , like a slight eq problem or a fade that should have gone just a little longer it is important that no matter where the music is recorded , musicians go prepared have realistic expectations of what the end product will sound like from a qualified engineer this is the best way for the band to feel their money was not wasted on a great project that sounds terrible by alexander johnstonpersonal experience from business \( the music lab \) image courtesy of yasunari makamuras flickr page creative commons license bands , music , recording , studio

friend , and for me to serve that bold artistic spirit firsthand , was a privilege and great gift he leaves behind a legacy of work that will bring insight , inspiration and healing for generations to come cohen was the dark eminence among a small pantheon of extremely influential singer songwriters to emerge in the sixties and early seventies only bob dylan exerted a more profound influence upon his generation , and perhaps only paul simon and fellow canadian joni mitchell equaled him as a song poet cohen 's haunting bass voice , nylon stringed guitar patterns and greek chorus backing vocals shaped evocative songs that dealt with love and hate , sex and spirituality , war and peace , ecstasy and depression he was also the rare artist of his generation to enjoy artistic success into his eighties , releasing his final album , you want it darker , earlier this year i never had the sense that there was an end , he said in 1992 that there was a retirement or that there was a jackpot for many of us , leonard cohen was the greatest songwriter of them all , nick cave , who covered cohen classics like avalanche , i'm your man and suzanne , said in a statement utterly unique and

, who later that year included two of his songs , including the early hit suzanne , on her album in my life his new york milieu included andy warhol , the velvet underground , and , most importantly , the haunting german singer nico , whose despondent delivery he may have emulated on his exquisite 1967 album songs of leonard cohen cohen quickly became the songwriter 's songwriter of choice for artists like collins , james taylor , willie nelson and many others his black and white album photos offered an arresting image to go with his stark yet lovely songs his next two albums , songs from a room \( 1969 \) and songs of love and hate \( 1971 \) , benefited from the spare production of bob johnston , along with a group of seasoned session musicians that included charlie daniels during the seventies , cohen set out on the first of the many long , intense tours he would reprise toward the end of his career one of the reasons i'm on tour is to meet people , he told rolling stone in 1971 i consider it a reconnaissance you know , i consider myself like in a military operation i do n't feel like a citizen his time on tour inspired the live sound producer john lissauer brought to his 1974 masterpiece , new skin for the old ceremony however , he risked a production catastrophe by hiring wall of sound maximalist phil spector to work on his next album , death of a ladies man , whose

styles on recent songs \( 1979 \) , cohen accorded warnes full co vocal credit on 1984 's various positions various positions included hallelujah , a meditation on love , sex and music that would become cohen 's best known composition thanks to jeff buckley 's incandescent 1994 reinterpretation its greatness was n't recognized by cohen 's label , however by way of informing him that columbia records would not be releasing various positions , label head walter yetnikoff reportedly told cohen , look , leonard we know you 're great , but we do n't know if you 're any good cohen returned to the label in 1988 with i'm your man , an album of sly humor and social commentary that launched the synths and gravitas style he continued on the future \( 1992 \) in 1995 , cohen halted his career , entered the mt baldy zen center outside of los angeles , became an ordained buddhist monk and took on the dharma name jikan \( silence \) his duties included cooking for kyozan joshu sasaki roshi ,

always plagued him leonard cohen , the hugely influential singer and songwriter whose work spanned five decades , died at the age of 82 gijsbert hanekroot redferns gettythe final act of cohen 's career began in 2005 , when lorca cohen began to suspect her father 's longtime manager , kelley lynch , of embezzling funds from his retirement account in fact , lynch had robbed cohen of more than 5 million to replenish the fund , cohen undertook an epic world tour during which he would perform 387 shows from 2008 to 2013 he continued to record as well , releasing old ideas \( 2012 \) and popular problems , which hit u s shops a day after his eightieth birthday y ou depend on a certain resilience that is not yours to command , but which is present , he told rolling stone upon its release and if you can sense this resilience or sense this capacity to continue , it means a lot more at this age than it did when i was 30 , when i took it for granted when the grand tour ended in december 2013 , cohen largely vanished from the public eye in october 2016 , he released you want it darker , produced by his son adam severe back issues made it difficult for cohen to leave his home , so adam placed a microphone on his dining room table and recorded him on a laptop the album was met with rave reviews , though a new yorker article timed to its release revealed that he was in very poor health i am ready to die , he said i hope it 's not too uncomfortable that 's about it for me the singer songwriter later clarified that he was exaggerating ive always been into self dramatization , cohen said last month i intend to live forever suzanne \( rare footage \)

chicago cubs first baseman anthony rizzo stepped up to the microphone during the world series rally in grant park and choked up , as he spoke about what it meant to be able to be on a team with the 38 year old catcher david ross , who was a mentor to him rizzo , ross , and center fielder dexter fowler stood shoulder to shoulder singing that silly jingle , the one that goes , go cubs go ! go cubs go ! hey , chicago , whaddya say \? cubs are gonna win today it all really hit home for me as a cubs fan life is full of things that bring us joy but carry unsavory aspects to them the cubs team is owned by tom ricketts , a man who donated 1 million to donald trump and bears a frightening resemblance to ted cruz so much that one might think ricketts was his brother the cubs also signed aroldis chapman , a closer , who served a 30 game suspension this year for domestic abuse cubs executives and city officials are responsible for some pretty rapid gentrification in the area of wrigleyville with that said , almost all of the cubs players had fun with each other and never let the pressures of fan fueled folklore around curses defeat them that made the postseason truly blissful this is where i wrote , thomas g , my fathers name on the wall i had to squeeze it in near the brick sidewalk i live about seven blocks from wrigley field i went down there multiple times in the past week the day after they won , i went down to wrigley field to write my fathers name on the stadium wall and join thousands of other cubs fans in paying tribute to family , who died before they could see the cubs win a world series in the immediate hours after their sweet victory , i took my life into my own hands and went down to the area around clark and addison to snap a photo of the stadium sign with world series champions emblazoned on it on sunday , right before game 5 , down 3 1 in the series , i stood outside the friendly confines and said to myselfand to my father , even though i dont really believe in this kind of stuff , this was going to be the game where they turned it all around that they could still come back also , i bought a copy of the chicago sun times after each game , even the editions with the devastating headlines on game 3 and game 4 , because it was important to have the full story i can now put those papers side by side and forever see the journey the chicago cubs took and relive the heart wrenching and euphoric moments that took place this seismic sports eventending the longest championship drought in american sports historygripped me like so many other americans it taught me , once again , the importance of slowing down life and reveling in these kind of experiences which i know is easy for me to say i did not have a boss , who told me i had to work a night shift or else i would be fired i did not have to worry about what i was going to do to feed my children or prevent my home from being foreclosed i did not have to be concerned about an array of disadvantages people should not have to confront on a daily basis , but all too often we just go , go , go , and lose sight of those little things that can make us feel a bit more content in life or we reject slowing down to appreciate something amazing that magnificently disrupts our routine additionally , during an election that has smothered and shaken many of us , the perfect antidote was watching this team play baseball players like rizzo let their guard down and made themselves vulnerable in front of us they were on a world stage , where they perhaps may have thought they needed to maintain a level of toughness or masculinity rizzo , on the other hand , as he now famously told ross during game 7 , was an emotional wreck , and he did not seem to be ashamed of making that confession many of us were emotional wrecks everyone watching this series felt like emotional wrecks at some point not everyone watched all moments of the games , unless you happened to be in the select group of people that possibly had tickets to all the games ill never forget how ross told rizzo it was only going to get worse in the 9th inning he was right the cleveland indians tied the game in the 8th , acrobatic second baseman javier baez had a mishap with a bunt that could have been costly in the 9th , and fans had to bow their heads and hope chapman would not make a mistake , even though manager joe maddon clearly overworked him the past few games statue outside wrigley field of ernie banks \( photo by \) the weather went from great to pouring rain there was a delay that delay gave the team a kind of gift , a bit of a halftime to find their composure to go out and win in the 10th inning \( it was suggested during the rally that this may have been a gift from legendary shortstop and first baseman , ernie banks , who was mr cub or , legendary third baseman ron santo , who later became a wgn radio broadcaster \) so , rizzo , the emotional wreck , stepped up to the microphone during the rally and gave this very real and human tribute to a mentor , grandpa ross , who played his last game on november 2 gramps and i sat down a few years ago in an offseason before his last season with boston he was a free agent , and we just talked , rizzo shared we had the same agent were talking , and i say to my agent , man , this is what the chicago cubs need he is exactly what we need to bring everything together obviously , a lot of pieces came through with that , but he taught myself personally how to become a real winner hes like a brother to me fighting back tears , rizzo continued , hes taught me a lot in lifeon the field , off the field , how to be a better person im forever grateful for him hes going out a champion forever for the rest of his life , he can say the last game that he played hes a world champion that to me is what has made these past moments special the fact that it took so very long for the team to finally win a baseball championship means all three to four generations were brought together sons and daughters know their parents longed for this , and many of them have parents , who longed to see what happened if those parents are still alive , their parents were ecstatic to have lived to see a cubs world series families shared stories about their first games , games they remembered , games they want to forget , and games they saw with their fathers or mothers they shared stories of players they remembered or recalled when they first put on a cubs baseball hat or wore a jersey with their favorite players name on the back i dug out a photo of me when i was a toddler wearing my cubs shirt i am 28 years old i waited 13 years for this because 2003 was the first postseason , where i really got into watching the cubs play and experienced what it meant to fail to end the drought when they lost to the florida marlins in the national league championship series that is a rather short time span when compared to legions of fans maddon said , its a players game indeed , but for the cubs , its unique cubs baseball was essentially a fans game , much more so than other ball clubs the last two years of decisions by business executives were made for the fans the scouts , who went out and found these all star players , did it for the fans they recognized there were so many aging chicago cubs fans , who kept asking them on the street if they were going to live to see the cubs win a world series theo epstein , one of the executives who enabled this team , did not want to have to tell any more fans to take their vitamins when asked if this would be the year even with 103 wins in the regular season and the status of number one team in baseball , all too many fans were aware of the record for teams , who came in to the postseason on top and did not make it to the world series we also took note of the statistics for comebacks in the world series when teams were down 3 1 so few ever win not only three games in a row but three games in a row , including two on the road that put tremendous pressure on the cubs players they clearly felt it , and we thank them for putting up with millions of emotional wrecks as fans process and revel in the fact that it happened \( as maddon would say , how we did not suck \) , i think about what this means for next year for the first time , it is possible to watch the cubs without bringing a legacy of doubt and negativity to games there are no more goats there is no more steve bartman there are no more distractions that are not typically part of baseball everyones favorite punchlines dont really work anymore they all are part of the past , and the immediate future is baseball with a team that will have some of the players , who won this championship and who will undoubtedly find ways to dazzle us again as they attempt to repeat as champions in 2017 for a coda , chicago cubs fan caitlin swieca pledged a day after chapman signed with the team in july to donate 10 to a chicago domestic violence organization every time he got a save her campaign managed to raise over 31 , 000 , especially when it took off after she shared it on twitter swieca told espn she thought during game 7 , we all compromised what we believed in to root for this guy , and hes gonna blow it then , it shifted to a celebration cubs pitcher mike montgomery got his first career save ever , and it was in game 7 of the world series she was happy chapman did not get the glory and said it couldnt have been scripted better oh , and at the parade , some of us fans looked up to see a plane with a banner that read , chinese americans for trump go cubs i stood next to a filipino american family , who had some chinese heritage in their ancestry she thought it must be a joke then , someone told her it was real they read something about this group of chinese americans instantly , she said she was insulted were not all trump fans because ricketts owns our team only a small segment are , and they are the same kind of white men and women disconnected from reality , who you will find in the fandom of just about every american sports team they would probably support trump whether ricketts was a cubs executive or not illinois governor bruce rauner and chicago mayor rahm emanuel were at the rally , but they are both hot garbage neither took the stage to speak , and i view that as some kind of small political victory that sweetens the victory over a baseball team with a racist colonialist sports mascot , which should be replaced immediately in fact , lets conjure the curse of the racist mascot and say the cubs passed it on to them and thatll prolong their championship drought until they replace chief wahoo maybe then the indians will get rid of him the post appeared

nov 4 , 2016 21 2 if the ego had an engine , its fuel would be fear trepidation isnt all bad , but it certainly has its time and place fear can render us quivering and useless , or motivate us toward change in the study of zen , we learn how to not only overcome our fears , but to become fearless this is called the lions roar of zazen the lion is the living embodiment of self possessed power this animal has dominion over all he sees as well as the courage , speed , and might to attain all he desires his deportment is regal and calm , though , never bullying and neither shrinking the metaphor of the lion is used to describe how one overcomes fear in the majjhima nikaya , a collection of middle length discourses on buddhas teachings , and they are immaculate at describing the fears most of us face many zen teachers describe how to become regal and fearless in their discourses as well fear of the loss of life zen master , d t suzuki says that fear of the loss of body is usually what we must overcome first following this , an internal consciousness becomes aware that we are threatening the slated , well accepted notion of being merely corporeal , and we think we are frightened suzuki says we neednt look any further than the bodily sensations that arise when we simply ponder fearfulness an empty feeling in the lower abdomen ensues , there is an immobility at the base of the tongue , and our breathing becomes restricted if we were to remove these sensations , though , fear becomes a meaningless thing szkuki attests that according to zazen , we aim to keep a lower abdomen full of power , the breathing always uniform , the heart beat tranquil , and the muscles of the whole body resilient so that if emotions like fear arise , they can easily be encountered and dismissed fear of the loss of self some fear is understandable , even such as when we realize we must face a spiritual death in order to progress on our path although we may long to richer higher levels of consciousness , we arent always so keen to let go of the habits and crutches that have propped up our current level of awareness as the sufi poet rumi once said , no one will find his way to the court of magnificence until he is annihilated other types of fear make us meek and fallible our consciousness easily wavers , and we cannot attain mu , or a state of zen , let alone get on with our daily activities it is only by cultivating the 4 zen states of mind that we can fill our abdomens with power and roar like a lion with fearlessness 4 zen states of mind shoshin or beginners mind \( \) is the first stage in cultivating fearlessness think of a time when you were excited , and eager to start a new endeavor there might have been unknowns , but you were brimming with glee over trying something new this is the type of mind we want to cultivate with all aspects of life instead of begin nervous or fearful , we can aim to be eager and open , accepting all that comes our way in order to approach life from the beginners mind we need to let of preconceived notions , and be optimistic if youve been able to have this feeling with one thing youve done in life , you can translate that feeling to other areas also fudoushin \( \) means you have an immovable mind it doesnt mean you are stubborn , but fudoushin does translate to being determined in the face of obstacles does a lion run away from present danger \? hardly the animal doesnt get angry or judgmental about obstacles either he is peaceful like the eye of the storm until he is upon his prey if you can develop fudoushin when you are under stress , you will be unstoppable in life mushin \( \) or without mind this is a similar philosophy to the chinese taoist idea of wei wuwei when we are in the zone working on a great masterpiece or doing something we love , weve likely already experienced the state of mushin when we are empty of thoughts , yet moving and acting purely in the present moment , without fear , anger , ego , or other emotion , we are a force to be reckoned with by developing equanimity and learning how to focus to the point of no thought , we can cultivate mushin the last of the four states of zen mind is called zanshin \( \) which literally translates to remaining mind this state of mind contains two precise elements it means you are both relaxed and keenly aware of your surroundings this is the state that marital artists aim to be in so that they can react at any moment to anything that comes their way by maintaining relaxed alertness fear cannot sway you , even in the face of a frightening opponent fear of suffering the buddha taught that self grasping and ignorance are the root of all remaining fears healthy fears aside , our tendency to try to avoid suffering the fear of failure , heartbreak , being trapped , being lost , etc are all caused by a single root and arise from the mind in shantidevas guide to the bodhisattva way of life , is is said that the buddha articulated , the source of all our fear comes from our own uncontrolled minds or delusions in order to overcome this root cause of fear , the buddha , and zen masters alike , teach to strive for no self or emptiness this doesnt mean a nihilistic view for life is adopted friedrich nietzsche accused buddhism of being existentialist , but the buddha taught us to seek the middle way between the mundane and the spiritual , seeing objects as real but dependently originated , not self and unsatisfactory instead of seeing all things as pointless and empty , we see mundane life as meaningless but recognize spiritual goals as meaningful as the zen master , sojo has said , heaven and earth and i are of the same root , the ten thousand things and i are of one substance after all , even once the buddha gave up all his worldly possessions he realized he was no closer to achieving nirvana he discovered that exaggerated asceticism was not required to attain enlightenment by learning how to work through these fears , we can achieve the lions roar of full realization
by on october 27 , 2016 visible origami oct 26 , 2016 dog poet transmitting i would like , within the limitations of my ability , to talk a little about bhakti yoga today which for me is the only legitimate fast track to the divine that exists for the present and the least dangerous of all the options out there my life keeps going by and i step in and out of it these days i spend a great deal of my time in reflection , as well as preparation for my ongoing journey it might be awhile yet and it may be right around the corner , either is fine with me i have come to understand that loving the divine is so very , very much easier , once all the distractions that the greatest majority of us live with are in pursuit of , or which predominates over all of the esoteric alternatives are gone without my even being aware of it , at first , nearly all of the usual human attractions and compulsions just slipped out the door and havent returned i find myself watching life behind some kind of glass its a movie that is being screened in the mind but once the film in the projector has been changed , ordinary life becomes irrelevant and one can immerse themselves in more important considerations one still goes to the supermarket one still eats and excretes one sleeps and awakens in the dream one drives and walks and watches and listens to all of the sounds of the world around them but the effect of all of it has changed last night \( as happens a couple of times a month \) i laid in my bed and did not sleep most of the night so i did as i usually do and repeated , i love you over and over and over on this night there was an atmosphere of static and confusion and i could not seem to break through it images of the past spiraled through to haunt me over mistakes made and opportunities missed the voice entered and said , do not occupy your mind with thoughts of what is past these have all been paid for through your suffering they are not relevant anymore try telling that to the monkey mind however , the point is that regardless of the static and confusion and the seeming distance between myself and the divine , i did not allow any of these distractions to deter me from the continuous repetition of , i love you i felt the obstacles that hung in the air i felt all the barriers that occasionally come and go and are sometimes not there at all and i just kept at it i studiously ignored whatever it was that was interfering with my efforts and i told myself that i would not allow anything to intrude , no matter how much it did intrude no matter what the difficulty might be i would persevere and i did i fell asleep at some point i awoke this am and said , good morning lord it is another day and i do not want to forget that every day given to me is an opportunity to celebrate the almighty , no matter how far away the almighty might seem to be and no matter how difficult the effort might become the path of love is not an easy cruise to some literal or metaphorical caribbean island though we paint it as the only sure and certain route here , this does not mean it is also an easy route there is bound to be opposition in times of material darkness there are agents of that darkness who seek to hinder and hamper our efforts and often these days no real efforts are even made the world seems to be swept away in a tidal waves of garbage and noxious dreams that spin themselves out of perverted daylight humanity is there to be found in the midst at all times but it takes a concerted determination to rise and greet it at every turn where it seeks to appear to me , this is the real work to move through the murk of this gray scale existence and reach out to every hungry and troubled heart with some portion of the sunlight we are all given for the purpose of sharing if we are cheap with our sunlight , the amount of sunlight given will decrease and further decrease until we find ourselves in darkness i refer you to the parable from jesus the christ where he gave the example of the three men to whom a certain amount of talent were given so it is when you are kept awake in the night and you strive and reach for unity with the ineffable and you get nowhere you continue and continue as if , at any moment , you will achieve that unity and you will not cease until you do even if it is a thousand times a thousand nights , even if you are in prison or confined in even greater distress in the houses of the rich you do not deter you do not immerse yourself in comforting distractions one day the sun will rise in your heart and there will be no further static or confusions the love of god is a consuming fire and fortunate is the one so consumed it is important to understand that such a love will demand everything of you and such a love will try and test you to discover the level of your dedication and sincerity many are called but few are chosen i am reminded of that short but powerful poem by stephen crane , the wayfarer the reality of this great and singular quest is precisely as the poem describes and there have been many souls who have discovered the truth of it as they went surging forward in all their temporary and unchallenged zeal , right up until they saw that every blade of grass was not a blade of grass imagine in your own life and in your own mind , how often you forget about the ineffable and how often petty and incidental concerns arise in your thoughts to take you away later you can often not remember what these concerns were but you can certainly remember that they were of small importance , since you often cannot even remember what they were when we look back on our lives we cant recall how we got where we got at all life is filled with things of small importance for me , it is critical to remember that there are forces that are actively engaged in steering us wrong and placing obstacles in our way and it is even more critical to recall certain clues such as this one from the lords prayer lead us not into temptation every agency that places obstacles and lures upon our path are not entities of the dark side lord ganesha is portrayed with two items one of them ensnares us and one of them frees us regardless of whatever religious schematic you may consider the nature and ruling power of the universe through , the similarities are glaring for the objectively minded unfortunately for many we live in a time of punishing subjectivity it tends to influence the way we think and feel and behave it takes a strong and inspired heart to break free and a steadfast intention to continue to that point the rate and intensity of contention between and among us seems to increase by the day , according to the divide and conquer philosophy that guides the game plans of those who serve the prince of darkness in this time of the harvesting of souls , it is of critical importance to both sides of the equation in this truly important time in what direction we are swayed i can truthfully say that recent years , until the beginning of this one , have been extremely difficult for me strangely enough , during some of the most difficult and inexplicable events , i just moved through it as if it were of no consequence at all , even though they were life and circumstance changing and might have caused me no end of grief but it all seemed like a passing dream to me i didnt get angry i was filled with wonder that it happened and uninformed as to the meaning of any of it it passed and i moved on from one situation to another , to the one i find myself in and its all behind me there and of no present relevance i could have gotten angry , or fearful , or despairing or depressed but none of this occurred and i do not chalk this up to any great strength or fortitude on my part it is as if the ineffable has been slowly but surely slipping ever deeper into my life and every challenge and trauma was just one more act on the part of the ineffable to distract me from the reality of the almighty taking up residence in my life i realize now that it is not what happens to you that is most meaningful but it is how you react to it once you have stilled the reactive mind you are closer to your real home than you might imagine loving god will draw the divine to you because the almighty is helpless before the sincere love of any soul it has been said in many eastern texts that the ineffable is the slave of love we must consider that this implies being a willing slave because the almighty is not subject to anything that the almighty does not choose to be subject to love the divine with all your heart and soul and mind and the lord will return it in kind this is what i believe and this is what i am inspired to speak of let this love permeate your existence and see every event in your life as a blessing and it will surely prove to be so remember that every incident in your life , no matter how insignificant it may seem , is a particular dealing of the ineffable with your soul end transmission
by on november 6 , 2016 nov 6 , 2016 dog poet transmitting its saturday , late afternoon and tuesday is two days away , if you dont count the rest of today or tuesday because it would then be tuesday and not away anymore then again , it will take all day tuesday for whatever the nonsense is to complete itself and possibly into the next day as well one thing that this election has done and which hasnt come to the attention of many people is that it has woken the public up the public has been able to see first hand the level of media bias and the cynically suckupping celebrities it has been able to see the intensity of the lies in all those political commercials like the one that said trump was walking in on naked beauty contestants , some of whom were only 15 years old that one amused me i have never seen the degree of vituperation that has been taking place i have never seen the media so clearly expose itself for what it is it did it in such a way and to such a degree that even the wet brain american public was able to see it mr apocalypse is like an expensive watch a multiplicity of gears turning and each gear is a kind of plot construct and it seems impossible to tell which of them are turning all of the others you might term it a wheels within wheels kind of thing , or a number of those acts of misdirection from a great magician all the while a variety of events seem to be taking place but what is happening is that something else , entirely different , is being woven out of them all the while , as the psychopaths and opportunists are having their way , their every machinations is being recorded for posterity and their every act is being choreographed to a specific end destiny is one of those words , one of those concepts , like karma that has a temporal meaning over a broad surface spectrum , because of the varieties of interpretations given by this one or that one but these words have much deeper interpretations that exist , according to the depth of the one giving the interpretations destiny has an individual application and then various broader applications families have destinies , towns and cities have destinies , nations have destinies and even planets have destinies , as do solar systems and galaxies the gods have a destiny the gods have karma and all of the aforementioned do as well this accounts for some of those who walked out on their families and the towns and cities they were birthed in and grew up in they were in search of something they carried with them as they went looking it doesnt matter where you are no matter where you are , there you are and the most priceless and valuable thing that it is possible to acquire , you are transporting from place to place as you look for it under the guise of everything else the first consideration any human being ought to make in this life is to ponder what it is that is distracting them from self inquiry what is it that makes it so difficult to scrutinize the imponderables of existence how is it that one can see the sun and moon in the sky and the glittering and countless stars and not know that there is some grand and majestic power at work how can one pass by the buddhas and hindu gods in the antique shop window and no wonder about the tales that attend them \? how can one not make the connection between the face of a new born baby and an old man sitting in his chair on a porch \? how can one attend birthday parties and all those other celebrations and then attend a funeral and not make the connection that since they were present at all of the other events , how could they not expect that a funeral would be held for them \? there is a story about the pandava brothers where dharma appears as a stork to one of the brothers and asks him what the greatest mystery is the brother doesnt know and the stork says , that you see men dying all around you and do not think that you yourself will die was that in the mahabharata \? im not remembering it that well but its been decades since i read the major books from the hindu tradition except for the bhagavad gita that always seems to be around here somewhere \( grin \) i cannot shake the feeling that some shocking surprises are looming in the event horizon i also cannot get around the feeling of this unshakable optimism that suffuses the atmosphere all around me there are threats of earthquakes and tsunamis there are wars and rumors of wars there is the specter of economic collapse the worst of it is the collective immersion of the human psyche in material culture without this freakish zombie obsession the self styled elite would have no power over the rest of us but it is like pouring swill into a hog trough with the certainty that the hogs will come a running it is a form of pornography even worse than the usual fare its the single most difficult hurdle of them all human ignorance and indifference are what makes all of the visible evil possible and hardly anyone even sees it its business as usual it is the daily redundancy of the dream walkers , lumbering up and down the aisles of somewhere in search of something it is the unexamined lives from cradle to grave with nothing understood and nothing to remember precious lives wasted and in vain few realize the value and privilege of a human birth fewer still realize the potential of it powerful invisible forces wait at the ready for any and every person who begins to show an interest in the hidden side of existence they watch to see who awakens to the joy of service they pray for the opportunity to assist in every righteous endeavor these days more time is spent publicizing a persons acts of alleged charity than the act was worth wealth is relative and so is the value of ones contributions weve become a cartoon in so many ways bruce springsteen canceled his north carolina leg of his tour because north carolina wouldnt back down from george soross efforts to create gender neutral bathrooms should hillary succeed in stealing the election , you may be sure that she will continue all of the perversion themes of bwak ! obama because the same people that own him , own her i cant imagine that who becomes president is going to make a great deal of difference because america has a specific destiny and a specific karma and we are watching it unwind in the meantime , regardless of the threats of earthquakes and tsunamis , wars and rumors of wars , economic collapses , political psychopathy and whatever else is out there , a spiritual renaissance is being generated for those so inclined anything is possible so i wont conjecture what might or might not happen flying saucers could come out of the skies the people who live in the earth might migrate to the surface the aliens among us might suddenly expose themselves in their real skin holographic jesus could materialize all over the world at the same time the mist around shambala could dissolve and reveal itself and then the destiny of that scenario could play out portals could open all over the planet and those who are able to see them could walk through them into another world or dimension there is no telling what may or may not occur but it goes without saying that it cant continue to go on the way it has been going and that we are pretty much assured of sweeping and dramatic changes greater than most of us can imagine the solution is whatever you come up with based on what you are after or my version , complete surrender to and reliance on the ineffable who is in absolute control of all of it in the first and last place and all spaces and places in between if one is capable of uniting their consciousness with the cosmic consciousness then one enters into the cosmic consciousness and becomes a visible representative of the invisible theres a learning curve of course but once muscle memory and all the rest of those memories come on line one is in a positions to sail like a swan upon the river of time hassan i sabbah once said , nothing is real , everything is permitted certainly according to appearances \( grin \) he happens to be right and the only difference between any of us is determined by ones intention and that decides the good and the bad of it relatively speaking it is my hope that all of you not only pass through the flotsam and jetsam that is coming in on the tide but that you absolutely flourish see you somewhere around tuesday end transmission visible reads from the 6th chapter ofthe way to the kingdom
