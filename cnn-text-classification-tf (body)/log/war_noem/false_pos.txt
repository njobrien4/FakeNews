los angeles times casino operators know there are no gamblers quite like the chinese with their affinity for baccarat the most lucrative game in las vegas chinese gamblers have long commanded special treatment be it with private chinese gaming salons lunar new year festivities or performances from pop stars flown in from hong kong and taiwan no one in las vegas however has built a casino and hotel strictly for chinese visitors until now the lucky dragon hotel casino is billing itself as las vegas first asian themed resort funded in large part by chinese investors the property set to open dec with a traditional lion dance will offer bilingual staff and signage a luxury tea bar and a host of restaurants with food that wouldnt look or taste out of place in guangzhou or shanghai no general tsos or egg rolls here said david jacoby chief operating officer for the resort which left no chinese superstition unturned the rose colored resorts front entrance is designed in a dragon motif a feng shui master blessed its kitchens the main bar is eight sided for good fortune and its hard to find a no on the property the unlucky digit is absent from room numbers and the phone directory the nine story hotel even skips a fourth floor this place is heavily feng shuied jacoby said with all that attention to detail youd think lucky dragons brain trust was born in beijing but the idea behind the room boutique resort off the northern end of the las vegas strip was largely conceived by an american veteran gaming executive bill weidner the former president and chief operating officer of las vegas sands corp weidner an advisor to lucky dragon is no neophyte to the chinese market he worked with some of chinas most powerful government figures to lead sands expansion into macau when the former portuguese colony relaxed its monopoly on gaming licenses in macau now generates nearly five times the gambling revenue of the las vegas strip forever changing the fortunes of the global casino industry weidner was also involved in the development of the billion marina bay sands in singapore before leaving the company in a bitter dispute in weidner and jacoby know major las vegas gaming resorts like the sands venetian mgm or wynn already cater to chinas high rollers with vip parlors and relationships forged in macau lucky dragon though tiny compared with those properties addresses what they see as a gap in the market middle class chinese gamblers chinese americans as well as the broader asian american community let them fight over the and let us fight over the remaining said jacoby who previously worked for weidners firm global gaming asset management opening a casino resort in the philippines that pool of chinese gamers will almost certainly grow on dec hainan airlines will fly the first direct flights from china to las vegass mccarran international airport already a record visitors from china traveled to las vegas last year nearly double the number in according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority meanwhile ground was broken on another asian themed resort this one much bigger than lucky dragon resorts world a malaysian hospitality and casino giant with decades of asian gaming experience is spending up to billion for a room property on the north strip that will feature chinese architecture such as an ersatz great wall its slated to open in plans are also underway to build a billion resort on the strip called alon las vegas the project is owned by australias crown resort who count chinese gamers as a major source of business its going to be even more of a competitive market said john decree an analyst at union gaming in las vegas everyones coming for the same customer its going to be a challenge with rooms the hotel is small compared with many on the strip but with five restaurants it offers more dining options than many its size competition could also be fierce for chinese high rollers whose gambling activity has been curtailed by a slowing chinese economy and an anti corruption campaign at home that until recently sent macau gambling revenues into a two year slump las vegas isnt immune to those headwinds after years of explosive growth casinos on the strip experienced a decline in the amount of money bet on baccarat to about billion in thats nearly billion less than according to the nevada gaming control board the casino industry uses the card game as a proxy for chinese gambling activity because of its massive popularity within the culture thats both for practical and superstitious reasons baccarat has the best statistical odds of beating the house compared with other games and as a game of chance over skill baccarat also plays into chinese fatalistic attitudes toward luck the vast majority of baccarat play comes from the asian market said jacoby of lucky dragon jacobys casino will offer seven vip baccarat tables on a second floor terrace with access to a vast menu of authentic chinese food in addition to live seafood flown in from all over the world the property will serve staples like congee wonton noodles and dim sum food is expected to be a big draw because chinese vacationers overwhelmingly prefer their native cuisine over others las vegas has a number of well regarded chinese restaurants such as ping pang pong at gold coast hotel casino china mama in chinatown and an outpost of chengdu taste the san gabriel valley stalwart for sichuan cuisine high end chinese food is also served at high roller rooms such as the venetians paiza club no casino however boasts the concentration of chinese restaurants that lucky dragon will with five altogether the hope is chinese tourists staying at other properties will choose to eat and gamble at lucky dragon when they venture off the strip the emphasis on food means lucky dragons owners can eschew things that arent particularly important to
email grab a box of tissues because this story is about to make you feel some big time feels two years ago john fitzpatrick got the most devastating phone call of his life when he learned that his brother robert had died of a heart attack in his sleep john instantly thought of roberts year old daughter sophie who was just starting to forge her path in life thats when this amazing uncle decided to step up in a seriously inspiring way with robert no longer there for her john took it upon himself to discourage his nieces art career okay is someone cutting onions in here because were getting just a little bit teary ever since his brothers passing john has made it a point to call his niece every single sunday evening to remind sophie just how much her father loved her how proud hed be if he could see her now and how unstable a career in the arts can be compared to more traditional nine to five employment sophies true passion in life has always been drawing and painting but thanks to her selfless uncles constant reminders that almost nobody actually ends up working their dream job shes now just two years away from getting her ba in marketing i want sophie to know that she can always depend on me john explained gazing tearfully at an old photograph of robert holding his baby girl but she cannot depend on freelance income especially in a field as oversaturated and undervalued as the arts shes way too smart for that john has never faltered in his commitment to making sure his niece understands just how unrealistic it is to earn a living as an artist last summer when sophie landed an internship at a brooklyn art gallery john spent countless hours reminding her that new york is expensive dangerous and very far away from ohio before ultimately finding her a job doing administrative work for his friend instead and when sophie briefly considered getting a double major in studio art her uncle pulled out all the stops even going so far as to gain control of her late fathers finances so that he could temporarily withhold the semesters tuition check until she changed her mind incredible is there an uncle of the year award because this guy definitely just won it while nobody can ever take the place of sophies father it is seriously heartwarming to see john step up to the plate like this sophie is so lucky to have an uncle she can always turn to for love guidance and stacks of brochures for mba programs handed to her at every family holiday heres to you john
alabamas last execution may have burned a man alive because the consciousness assessment it administers is about as scientific as someone jostling you when you nod off on the sofa this is clear from the firsthand account of ms terry deep a federal investigator who witnessed the execution of christopher brooks at holman prison in atmore alabama on january ms deep signed a sworn affidavit attached as an exhibit to an april court filing in the case of ronald bert smith detailing these observations mr smith is scheduled for execution in alabama on december and his federal defenders also represented christopher brooks ms deeps account goes like this after the warden called for order and read the execution warrant mr brooks made his final statement warden davenport then left the execution chamber leaving a correctional officer identified only as d f and the prison chaplain in the execution chamber the chaplain walked over to mr brooks held his hand and stepped away mr brooks breathing became rapid and shallow d f called out mr brooks name raised his eyelids and reached behind mr brooks left arm momentarily mr brooks eyes were closed at the end of this activity d f stepped away from mr brooks mr brooks breathing further slowed before the curtains were closed mr brooks left eye opened and was still open when the execution chamber curtains were closed using these critical observations federal defenders based in montgomery alabama cogently argue that alabamas execution protocol uses potassium chloride a drug that unquestionably causes an unconstitutional level of pain alabama does not intend to anesthetize ronald smith rather they intend to use a sedative with no analgesic properties to create the illusion of adequate anesthesia alabamas protocol further creates an illusion of adequate anesthesia by having an untrained corrections officer conduct a consciousness assessment to determine whether an inmate is anesthetized prior to injection of potassium chloride a drug that if injected without adequate anesthesia indisputably causes an unconstitutional level of pain because of the way midazolam works in the human body it could sedate an individual to the point where he was incapable of communicating that he was in pain while doing nothing to suppress the experience of pain because midazolam is a sedative and not an analgesic there is a high likelihood that an inmate who receives a high dose of midazolam would be unable to respond to the noxious stimuli that constitute the adocs consciousness check but would still feel the excruciating effects of the second and third drugs in laymans terms what the public defenders are saying is as human beings if we insist on pumping caustic corrosive drugs into other human beings our constitution and specifically the eighth amendments prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment demands it not cause excruciating pain in the case of lethal injection i respectfully submit this is an impossible burden to satisfy because thankfully exterminating human beings is hardly an exact science and corrections officers who execute in alabama and for that matter nationwide whose government paychecks come with a duty to kill are not when it comes to administering lethal injections the sharpest tools in the shed see stephanie mencimer state executioners untrained incompetent and complete idiots in alabamas executions including mr brooks the critical consciousness assessment the federal public defenders say is performed by a corrections officer who has received no medical training whereas anesthesiologists receive extensive training in order to assess a patients depth of anesthesia not only must they graduate from college and medical school they must follow this with four years of training before they can be certified to practice anesthesiology without supervision anesthesiologists however wont help alabama or any other state to whitewash using a seemingly mundane and sterile looking medical procedure the violent torture that lethal injection is as dr j jeffrey andrews secretary of the american board of anesthesiology wrote in may of we should never confuse the death chamber with the operating room lethal doses of execution drugs with anesthetic drugs or the executioner with the anesthesiologist physicians should not be expected to act in ways that violate the ethics of medical practice even if these acts are legal anesthesiologists are healers not executioners furthermore as the federal defenders in alabama highlight even if anesthesiologists did violate their professional code of ethics and participate in the ignominy of public executions a nesthesiologists do not take such action based solely on a manual assessment they also rely on the use of devices that monitor vital signs the events of christopher brooks execution indicate that defendants crude assessment conducted by an individual with no medical training creates a substantial risk of pain in violation of the eighth amendment mr brooks left eye opened after the consciousness assessment and assuming they even noticed no one from the adoc took any action the late dr jack kevorkian nicknamed dr death was once according to his new york times obituary called a reckless instrument of death who poses a great threat to the public but compared to corrections officers on the execution squad in alabama at least when kevorkian sent people to their deaths he had some medical training and whatever their efficacy he used machines in a paper kevorkian once authored called capital punishment or capital gain quote most of us are well aware that the ultimate laboratory for testing every medical fact concept or device is man himself in this logical and proper sequence of trial the human subject at the end the guinea pig is and always will be the most difficult link to procure viewing the problem purely realistically capital punishment as it exists today offers an unrivaled opportunity it would appear the state of alabama agrees is a former d c public defender who worked as an assistant federal public defender in alabama between and he has contributed to numerous magazines and newspapers in the united states and overseas he writes full time and lives in woodland hills california

enough a couple of years ago the start of the opera season was almost derailed by a strike by its unionized set artists and camera operators over company calls for a pay cut its an ironic fate for a

it was supposed to be an edgy thriller that made statements about upper echelon decadence while also utilizing the real world sex life of tom cruise and nicole kidman as a kind of doorway bridging the gap between reality and fantasy something that does come up in other kubrick films such as a space odyssey in this kubrick film however we have a statement about who runs the show the show is both the film itself as well as reality and kubrick wants viewers to realize that reality is run by our present showmasters of the videodrome the viewer is supposed to reflect upon the decadence of the eastern elite establishment but also notice that viewing the film itself is homage to present social hypocrisy since the film is a wannabe voyeuristic step into the sex lives of others in this regard it functions as an initiation none of the other analysts and commenters have really noticed this virtually every review i have read sees it as some elaborate mkultra illuminati mind control thing while other reviews from professors and academia see it as a social or psychological commentary i think it has elements of all this but the real goal is i believe an initiation process the viewer is watching the film because he or she is curious about hollywood secrets and elite lives think of all the silly gossip magazines we have the average joe went to see the film for a glimpse of nicole kidman and kubrick wants the viewer to see the hypocrisy in such an action given that most people will judge the films secret society cult eyes wide shut then is a descriptor of the audience as well as the characters in the film who dont really understand the sociopolitical power base that runs things the power base is not according to kubricks film the average politician or wealthy doctor or lawyer in new york indeed this is precisely kidman and cruises characters status they are unwitting inductees thus throughout the film the viewers eyes are wide shut to the reality of the power structure just as kidman and cruises characters are until the end when they have their eyes opened as they both say at the end let us proceed the opening scene shows us mrs harford between two pillars this is the doorway to the initiation in other words the two pillars figure prominently in freemasonry as the entrance way to the divine as borrowed from solomons temple nicole stands between two pillars jachin and boaz setting the initiatory tone for the film the two pillars of freemasonry borrowed from solomons temple indicating the doorway to the mysteries the viewer is being told from the beginning that they are to undergo an initiation into how the mysteries and the secret societies work particularly from a sociological perspective the harfords we discover are having marital troubles related to sexual frustrations it is also significant that it is christmas time when the initiatory procedure takes place as a kind of anti traditional religious anti christian statement it is also important to remember that all details in a kubrick film are significant the placement of everything is meaningful and deliberate as mentioned in the picture above the film is full of mirrors which are symbols of the psyche the inner world as it were as well as other worlds this occurs in alice in wonderland for example and this theme as well as the wizard of oz both figure prominently and are theosophical allegories most commenters who note this point to it as some kind of mkultra control mechanism but i think that is far flung more realistic would be the usage of such stories as allegories or metaphors for transformation the metamorphosis of initiation into the mysteries if you will both stories have theosophic undertones and symbolism and thus constitute initiatory tales as well when the harfords arrive at the party we see a clear symbol of what kind of initiation they are going to undergo a satanic one as we see from the inverted pentagram the doors of their perception are about to change as they enter the party marked with an inverted pentagram ziegler harfords friend invites the couple to his parties frequently under the auspices of eventually getting them to participate in the orgies as it turns out there are two parties and mr harfords old college buddy nick nightingale plays piano for both initially both harfords resist the temptation to sleep with other people yet appear to have the desire given their own marital sexual problems however what we continue to suspect is not that the events are randomly occurring but rather that it has been organized it is not an accident that bill harfords college buddy has shown up alice gets drunk and is then hit on by sandor szavost a wealthy hungarian szavost is likely a reference to anton szandor lavey the founder and high priest of the church of satan i think this is a symbolic reference just to let us know the crowd they are being allowed to party with is ultimately an upper echelon satanic cult it is also interesting to note that the original story is written about a couple who undergoes the experience in upper class austria around the turn of the century since germany is the origin of the actual members of the order of illuminati bill discovers that ziegler is involved in some shady dealings and apparently has some connection to drugs and beauty queens mandy a beauty queen we later discover is knocked out from drugs asleep and nude and we will find alice experience something similar mandy has almost overdosed and dr harford tells her she cannot keep doing what she is doing we dont know if its a suicide attempt or not it is also interesting that the nude woman in the painting above mandy is sprawled out in the same position as if to allude to the

donald trump likely to end aid for rebels fighting syrian governmentby november nyt washington president elect donald j trump said friday that he was likely to abandon the american effort to support moderate opposition groups in syria who are battling the government of president bashar al assad saying we have no idea who these people are in an interview with the wall street journal that dealt largely with economic issues including his willingness to retain parts of the affordable care act he repeated a position he took often during his campaign that the united states should focus on defeating the islamic state and find common ground with the syrians and their russian backers ive had an opposite view of many people regarding syria mr trump told the journal my attitude was youre fighting syria syria is fighting isis and you have to get rid of isis russia is now totally aligned with syria and now you have iran which is becoming powerful because of us is aligned with syria his comments suggest that once mr trump begins overseeing both the public support for the opposition groups and a far larger covert effort run by the central intelligence agency he may wind down or abandon the effort but there are in fact two wars going on simultaneously in syria one is against the islamic state in which the united states is supporting syrian kurdish and syrian arab fighters who last weekend announced they were opening a new phase of the battle beginning to encircle the isis capital in raqqa there are roughly united states special operations forces on the ground assisting these militia the second effort is in support of rebels fighting mr assad the c i a covert program is by far the largest conduit of support providing antitank missiles to rebels fighting the government that is the program that mr trump seems most intent on ending if the united states pursues that line we end up fighting russia fighting syria mr trump told the journal the argument for ending the support may be bolstered by the fact that as a matter of survival those opposition groups have entered into battlefield alliances with the affiliate of al qaeda in syria formerly known as al nusra this has had the effect of allowing mr assad and russia to argue that they are attacking al qaeda and the united states should aid them in that effort secretary of state john kerry acknowledged that argument during his ultimately failed effort to reach a deal for a cease fire and an ultimate settlement mr trumps the enemy of my enemy is my friend logic is consistent with what he said during the campaign im not saying assad is a good man cause hes not he told the new york times in an interview in march but our far greater problem is not assad its isis but it also takes a position that will gratify president vladimir v putin because it suggests that rather than pressure russia to end its support of mr assad a trump administration will get out of mr putins way in another hint of a major change in policy one of mr trumps primary national security advisers lt general michael t flynn the retired head of the defense intelligence agency wrote in the hill newspaper this week that the united states should extradite fethullah gulen who turkey has demanded should be sent back from his exile in pennsylvania the turkish government of recep tayyip erdogan has blamed him for a coup attempt over the summer the justice department has not yet concluded that there is any convincing evidence that mr gulen should be sent back to almost certain confinement or execution under an extradition treaty with the united states they see the request as part of mr erdogans effort to eliminate all opposition mr flynn adopted many of turkeys arguments about mr gulen arguing that american taxpayers are helping finance gulens charter schools in the united states and that it is more important to support turkey than be hoodwinked by this masked source of terror and instability nestled comfortably in our own backyard eric schmitt contributed reporting president assad syria is ready to co operate with donald trump the us is currently enmeshed in a complicated alliance in syria with turkey and saudi arabia who would like to provide rebels among them al qaeda backed factions with surface to air missiles what will trump do on syria the us should get out of the war in syria and avoid destabilising more middle eastern countries and the us should work with putin to defeat terrorist groups such as the islamic state of iraq and the levant

by lambert here apparently then neoliberal u plans to build trust based relations and offer personalised attention by gutting tenured faculty shifting the teaching load to contingent faculty redistributing salaries to administrators and socking money into fancy facilities let me know how that works out by philip oreopoulos professor of economics and public policy university of toronto and uros petronijevic assistant professor department of economics york university originally published at voxeu questions over the value of a university education are underscored by negative student experiences personalised coaching is a promising but costly tool to improve student experiences and performance this column presents the results from an experiment comparing coaching with lower cost nudge interventions while coaching led to a significant increase in average course grades online and text message interventions had no effect the benefits of coaching appear to derive from the trust based nature of relationships and personalised attention policymakers and academics share growing concerns about stagnating college completion rates and negative student experiences recent figures suggest that only of students who pursue a bachelors degree complete it within six years and it is increasingly unclear whether students who attain degrees acquire meaningful new skills along the way students enter college underprepared with those who procrastinate do not study enough or have superficial attitudes about success performing particularly poorly personalised coaching to improve outcomes a promising tool for improving students college outcomes and experiences is personalised coaching at both the high school and college levels an emerging recent literature demonstrates the benefits of helping students foster motivation effort good study habits and time management skills through structured tutoring and coaching cook et al find that cognitive behavioural therapy and tutoring generate large improvements in maths scores and high school graduation rates for troubled youth in chicago while oreopoulos et al show that coaching tutoring and group activities lead to large increases in high school graduation and college enrolment among youth in a toronto public housing project at the college level scrivener and weiss find that the accelerated study in associates program a bundle of coaching tutoring and student success workshops in cuny community colleges nearly doubled graduation rates and bettinger and baker show that telephone coaching by inside track professionals boosts two year college retention by across several higher education institutions while structured one on one support can have large effects on student outcomes it is often costly to implement and difficult to scale up to the student population at large noting this challenge we set out to build on recent advances in social psychology and behavioural economics investigating whether technology specifically online exercises and text and email messaging can be used to generate comparable benefits to one on one coaching interventions but at lower costs among first year university students several recent studies in social psychology find that short appropriately timed interventions can have lasting effects on student outcomes relatively large improvements on academic performance have been documented from interventions that help students define their long run goals or purpose for learning teach the growth mindset idea that intelligence is malleable and help students keep negative events in perspective by self affirming their values in contrast to these one time interventions other studies in education and behavioural economics attempt to maintain constant low touch contact with students or their parents at a low cost by using technology to provide consistent reminders aimed at improving outcomes providing text email and phone call updates to parents about their students progress in school has been shown to boost both parental engagement and student performance while direct text message communication with college and university students has been used in attempts to increase financial aid renewal and improve academic outcomes can lower cost alternatives to one on one coaching be effective we examine whether benefits comparable to those obtained from one on one coaching can be achieved at lower cost by either of two specific interventions we examine a one time online intervention designed to affirm students goals and purpose for attending university and a full year text and email messaging campaign that provides weekly reminders of academic advice and motivation to students we work with a sample of more than undergraduate students who are enrolled in introductory economics courses at a large representative college in canada randomly assigning students to one of three treatment groups or a control group the treatment groups consist of a one time online exercise completed during the first two weeks of class in the autumn the online intervention plus text and email messaging throughout the full academic year and the online intervention plus one on one coaching in which students are assigned to upper year undergraduate students who act as coaches students in the control group are given a personality test measuring the big five personality traits figure summarises our main results on course grades overall we find large positive effects from the coaching programme amounting to approximately a percentage point increase in average course grades we also find that coached students experience a standard deviation increase in gpa in contrast we find no effects on academic outcomes from either the online exercise or the text messaging campaign even after investigating potentially heterogeneous treatment effects across several student characteristics including gender age incoming high school average international student status and whether students live on residence figure main effects of interventions our results suggest that the benefits of personal coaching are not easily replicated by low cost interventions using technology many successful coaching programmes involve regular student coach interaction facilitated either by mandatory meetings between coaches and students or proactive coaches regularly initiating contact our coaches initiated contact and built trust with students over time in person and through text messaging through a series of gentle open ended questions the coaches could understand the problems students were facing and provide clear advice ending most conversations with students being able to take at least one specific action to help solve their current problems our text messaging campaign offered weekly
by on fri oct at pm as megyn kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her share on twitter print this post earlier this week friday fox follies under the assumption the explosive and bizarre battle between megyn kelly and newt gingrich would be this weeks lede i had already tricked up an opening paragraph in case you missed it thats when he got personal accused her of being obsessed by sex and she told him that he should work on his anger issues this weeks column would have been about how the fox audience continues to splinter as they take sides in the presidential election the nyt calls em megyn moments i call them fissures in what had been assumed to be the bedrock foundation of the fox news channel its unthinking audience then came word that rupert murdoch was playing hardball as kellys contract negotiations break out into the open that paragraph lovingly crafted went out the window but lets see what this fight was about because heat is always better than light for ratings as trump congratulates newt gingrich for getting his butt kicked by megyn kelly watch as kelly garners headlines for her feminism or lack thereof rupert murdoch seems desperate to keep her her contract expires next year and rupie opened up to the wall street journal of which he is owner to partially cajole kelly and partially to threaten her into extending her contract million in contract talks with fox news if they are going to make a network that is going to be a post ailes post trump it will be around megyn kelly chris wallace and shep smith and they are going to have to throw hannity and oreilly overboard said andrew tyndall a television news consultant of other hosts at the network that isnt going to happen promised mr murdoch were not changing direction that would be business suicide he said mr oreillys contract is also up at the end of next year and mr murdoch said were going to want bill to stay with us mr hannitys contract isnt up until ms kelly has forged close ties to mr murdochs sons particularly lachlan murdoch who is co executive chairman of fox and has taken an active role in contract talks people close to the situation said fox would like to settle this before the election and before kellys book is released both of which could only strengthen her position in the negotiations if all goes well from the the power of megyn kellys feminismeven if she doesnt call it that by the daily beasts tim teeman imagine then her mix of satisfaction and maybe ennui as she scrolled across some of the praise ridden screeds out today how megyn kelly became an improbable feminist icon megyn kelly has become the biggest example of white feminism at work and aw crapheres proof that megyn kelly is kind of a feminist role model now note the grudging headlines because of kellys employer and because she has not fought the good feminist fight in a conventional left wing context throughout her career to date the f word mantle is being conferred upon her with something of a scowl this in itself reveals a kind of blinkeredness on the part of kellys critics it is perfectly possible to work for a right facing institution and not be percent right wing yourself or spout the prevailing dogma of the tv station you work for aside from the fact that when she tilts right she tends to tilt alt right the biggest knock on kelly is that shes too hard edged marshall mcluhan spoke of the medium cool of tee vee but kelly comes across as the opposite of warm and fuzzy this makes her less attractive to other networks shes hoping to change that impression when she co hosts live with kelly ripa the morning after the election think of her as a designated hitter trying to knock murdochs hardball right out of the park still watters still a few weeks back fff reported on a racist watters world in which the white privileged pencil necked geek made fun of asians this week asian american groups meet with fox news personnel over awful jesse watters segment paul cheung president of aaja told the erik wemple blog that the meeting was productive i think they heard what the communitys reactions are he said of the session at new yorks museum of chinese in america approximately asian american groups and allies have signed an open letter to fox news regarding the unfortunate episode said cheung ron kim a new york state assemblyman in attendance told this blog that a representative from the oreilly factor and a senior representative from the news side of the channel attended the meeting together they played a good cop bad cop routine said kim the gentleman from oreillys show was defending what they were doing and trying to explain that this is a part of the opinion section of fox news and sometimes edgy humor can go too far said kim once again the specter of fox newss vaunted news opinion divide presents itself as weve noted before this is a convention borrowed from the newspaper industry to justify fox news hosts such as sean hannity openly campaigning for donald trump steve doocy of the morning show fox friends spreading harmful innuendo into the public square and oreilly allowing his protege to spread racist stereotypes all about chinatown
home foreign affairs rothschild bank now under criminal investigation over missing billion in global corruption probe rothschild bank now under criminal investigation over missing billion in global corruption probe jay syrmopoulos may comments last year the veil of invincibility seemingly came off the secretive rothschild banking empire as baron david de rothschild and his company the rothschild financial services group were indicted by french prosecutors for allegedly defrauding british pensioners in a scheme that saw large sums of money embezzled only two months ago we reported on the swiss branch of the edmond de rothschild group announcing that they were the target of a french criminal probe regarding a business relationship managed by a former employee now the luxembourg unit of rothschild banking empire is being investigated by the luxembourg state prosecutors office alleged to have sent hundreds of millions of dollars to an account at a bank in luxembourg that originated from development berhad the fund was established by malaysian prime minister najib razak in as a government investment fund there have been widespread accusations of corruption surrounding razak after billion dollars in deposits into his personal bank accounts were revealed the deposits totaled hundreds of millions of dollars more than had previously been exposed by probes into state fund according to the wall street journal the luxembourg investigation stems from an international probe of money that may have flowed from the malaysian government investment fund which is at the center of various worldwide corruption probes according to a report in the wsj the luxembourg unit of edmond de rothschild group a private bank that manages money on behalf of wealthy clients said it is cooperating with an official investigation of money that may have flowed from a malaysian government investment fund at the center of various world wide corruption probes the luxembourg investigation widens probes of already under way by authorities in switzerland malaysia singapore hong kong and abu dhabi swiss authorities said in january that related losses from misappropriation could reach billion the luxembourg prosecutor said its case was connected to the investigation in switzerland was created to invest in local energy and real estate projects to boost the malaysian economy the fund amassed billion in debt which it has struggled to repay last july the wall street journal reported that almost million was transferred to mr najibs bank accounts via a web of entities money which investigators believe originated with has denied sending money to mr najibs accounts and denied wrongdoing and said it is cooperating with probes edmond de rothschild europe is actively cooperating in the judicial proceedings a spokeswoman for the edmond de rothschild group told the wsj the edmond de rothschild group oversees roughly billion in assets according to bloomberg the private bank and asset management firm to the elite was founded by edmond de rothschild in paris in edmonds son benjamin de rothschild succeeded his father as head of the group in last year benjamin appointed his wife ariane chairwoman of the executive committee the swiss unit traces its roots to the acquisition of banque privee in geneva in but the history of the rothschild banking empire stretches far further back in time according to the richest the rothschild family as we know it is descended from mayer amschel rothschild who was born in what is now frankfurt germany the son of jewish moneychanger and trader amschel moses rothschild mayer amschel rothschild was the fourth of children and went on to establish a huge international banking empire through his sons mayer amschel rothschild expanded his banking business which was founded in the to international areas and as such managed to bequeath his huge wealth unlike many rich members of the jewish community at the time mayer amschels sons were each stationed at one of the major european financial centres one in frankfurt london naples vienna and paris this passing on of mayer amschels wealth and business meant that his sons could continue to build on the foundations of their fathers success in the century the rothschild family were at the height of their powers and were known all around the financial world their great fortune and ingenious business minds meant that they carried great power during this time they utilised this power by affecting some very significant events in human history in order to profit greatly from it this included backing the british forces with huge sums of money during the napoleonic wars and funding brazils claim for independence from portugal the rothschild banking dynasty is a family line that has been accused of pulling the political strings of many different governments through their control of various economic systems throughout the world historically there is ample evidence to show that the family has used insider trading to bilk money from both private and public funds towards the end of the napoleonic wars in nathan mayer rothschild saw napoleons war efforts as a threat to his business practices and decided to step in to help defeat the french conqueror he became the most important financier of the british war effort pouring the equivalent of million dollars in todays dollars in alone the defeat of napoleon and subsequent ending of the napoleonic wars which started in and raged throughout the continent for years before finally coming to an end in during the battle of waterloo in the napoleonic wars nathan rothschild was responsible for one of the oldest cases of insider trading which led to the rothschild family robbing a whole nation blind when the battle of waterloo took place in horse messengers were the fastest method of communicating information the rothschilds took advantage of this by having their own spies on the frontlines of the battle that would then expedite the information to the family faster than the messengers used by the military when the british won the battle nathan rothschild was of course the first to know and he immediately went to the stock exchange and started selling stocks while putting out
email im trying to make this campus more aware said jessica adams coordinator of lgbt services at the cross cultural and gender center at fresno state university in california im asking most people to unlearn this concept of gender that they have been taught for years and its not an easy task no doubt most people are stuck believing boys are boys and girls are girls adams argues that those who hold to such beliefs are the ones with the problem she recently helped mr love a female who is transitioning to a male become one of the first of these transgender students at fresno state to change her name on her student id card this is considered a huge victory by adams because she claimed you feel fraudulent as a person yet no one is allowing you to be who you are if you can imagine being called the wrong name for the rest of your life or even for a day if you kept telling them and they refused to acknowledge that thats painful mr love is transitioning by taking natural supplements rather than testosterone injections but this is not her first transition in the past she was at one time bisexual and has suffered from anxiety and depression in fact mr love reacted to the tragic news that people were murdered by an islamic terrorist in orlando by considering suicide it was all just too much mr love recalled i wanted to die one survey has found that more than percent of transgender people have attempted suicide in a study conducted by the new atlantis sex reassigned individuals were about times more likely to attempt suicide and about times more likely to die by suicide whatever the exact figures it is obvious that these are deeply mentally disturbed individuals after writing a suicide note to some friends mr love was forced into an ambulance and transported to a mental health center in fresno but what really upset her was when she looked down and saw the name on the plastic medical bracelet they had use mr loves birth name instead of mr love it was an aztec female name meaning goddess of music and dance mr love explained you have to realize every time you say it its going to be like knives to the heart to those in the transgender community birth names that identify the person as male when he wants to be known as a female or identify the person as female when a transgender individual wishes to be known as a male are referred to as dead names sometimes mr love uses the name of alex because it is more gender neutral when mr love was a high school student at clovis united the school board refused to adopt a gender neutral dress code boys and girls who supported the transgender students swapped clothes as a protest against school policy although no federal statute exists that requires local school districts to allow transgender males into girls locker rooms and vice versa the obama administration has told schools across the country they will either do so or face the loss of federal funds the charlotte observer recently editorialized in favor of allowing transgenders to use the bathroom they identify with and not their biologically appropriate one the paper dismissed concerns that sexual predators could use trangender oriented bathroom laws besides the paper lectured the thought of male genitalia in girlss locker rooms and vice versa might be distressing to some but the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort so according to the charlotte observer anyone who opposes a naked boy strolling into a shower full of naked girls is no better than a segregationist after all it was discomforting to a white bigot to be around black people and opposition to transgenders using the bathroom of the opposite sex well that is a bigoted stance too of course a similar opposing argument would have just as much or more logical validity maybe transgenders should get used to the discomfort of being naked around their own biological sex and that to do otherwise and force their nakedness on the unwilling opposite sex is akin to sexual assault although mr love wants to be recognized as a man she wants to keep her mezzo soprano voice ive come to terms with my voice my voice is everything its all i have mr love said mr love insists that she is a man trapped in a biological womans body and that she cannot help it i didnt ask for this life i didnt choose it i really didnt but a recent study in the new atlantis journal concluded that trangenderism is not supported by the science the report was co authored by dr paul mchugh who is the former chief of pyschiatry at johns hopkins university examining research from the biological psychological and social sciences this report shows that some of the most frequently heard claims about sexuality and gender are not supported by scientific evidence the hypothesis that gender identiy is an innate fixed property of human beings that is independent of biological sex that a person might be a man trapped in a womans body or a woman trapped in a mans body is not supported by scientific evidence insisted the researchers but it is not just that the acceptance of transgenderism is unscientific the report argues that such enabling is harmful an area of particular concern involves medical interventions for gender nonconforming youth they are increasingly receiving therapies that affirm their felt genders and even hormone treatments or surgical modifications at young ages in a statement released in march by the american college of pediatricians a similar conclusion was reached the report was entitled gender ideology harms children and in it they assert that taking gender dysphoria as anything other than a psychological problem is harmful one woman cari stella took to youtube to describe how this ideologically driven
friday november first there was spygate then there was deflategate and now prankgate it common knowledge amongst nfl fans that the new england patriots seek out innovative and creative ways to gain a competitive advantage often blurring the line between gamesmanship and rule breaking we all heard the rumors of helmet radio interference or fire alarms sounding late at night in visiting hotel rooms or that peyton manning himself refused to ever speak aloud in the locker room at foxborough but now it is alleged that over the past decade members of the special teams unit have placed thousands of elaborate prank calls to opposing players and coaches in hopes of disturbing them mentally and emotionally speaking anonymously a former special teams assistant named time pro bowl kicker stephen gostkowski as the ringleader of the operation the plan was to pose as solicitors family members or even romantic partners according to our source gostkowski makes the majority of the calls himself and finds considerable pleasure in hoodwinking his opponents he refers to himself as stephen gotcha kowski confessed the whistleblower stephen gostkowski might be the best kicker in the world but stephen gotcha kowski is the greatest pranker on the planet his words not mine when stephen arrived in bill belichick told the special teams guys to find busywork while the offense and defense were watching game film recalls the ex assistant stephen did even blink he started dialing that day and never looked back first we collected phone numbers of former patriots and ex teammates before the bye week we had every number in the league gostkowski took his craft seriously our source claims he hired a team of assistants to perform hours of research to craft the perfect call to suit each victim when a video surfaced of rex ryan fetishizing his wife feet gostkowski brought his own wife in and jumped on the opportunity he had his wife hallie flirting with rex three or four times a week she was just as into the pranking as stephen was she made up a character for herself bought a bunch of high heels and would act out scenes while she was on the phone with him rex loved that girl he was ready to put her in his will this prank may have backfired however by serving as motivation for rex the jets beat the patriots in the playoffs one month later before the afc championship game the shenanigans took a dark turn gostkowski called colts head coach tony dungy posing as a suicidal college student that got intense our source remembers coach dungy was a sweetheart they talked for hours and by the end of it steve was broken down in tears i thought dungy was wearing him down emotionally but as soon as they hung up he busted out laughing and got started on the next call that one gave me the creeps again gostkowski ploy failed despite the lack of sleep dungy warm and motivational demeanor helped his colts to defeat the patriots on the way to a super bowl victory more than just a conniving prankster gostkowski also became a master impersonator in he spent weeks honing a spot on impression of coach jim harbaugh gostkowski studied his dialect inflections and even began mimicking the coach movements and style of dress while at home he then called harbaugh brother ravens head coach john harbaugh and slipped into character dude went balls out on that call recounts the former assistant he drank cans of red bull and threatened to set john house on fire with such a bold claim one would think harbaugh would catch on quickly but that was the case john totally bought it almost as if the threats came as no surprise to him public records do indicate that police visited both homes on january but it did not hinder the performance as harbaugh squad thumped the pats in the wild card playoff game the next day this method however did not deceive another famous pair of brothers gostkowski called giants quarterback eli manning prior to the patriots devastating super bowl xlii loss this time posing as legendary quarterback peyton manning eli was really smart about it our source discloses he was one of the first to catch on he strung steve along discussing for a good minutes or so then eli started asking him personal questions with increasing specificity steve came prepared and nailed the stuff about peyton favorite sandwich and the suspicious spot on his scrotum but crumbled when eli brought up a childhood story about a manning family reunion that ended in tragedy gostkowski pretended to lose service and hung up the phone but he was sweating bullets after locking up the stunning upset manning made sure to catch up with gostkowski on the field eli shook steve hand brought him in close and whispered dropped the turd in the that really pissed him off just how many prank calls has stephen gotcha kowski made over the years i would say upwards of five thousand that just during practice who knows how much pranking he did in his spare time the source alleges that gostkowski once convinced former bengals head coach jon gruden to buy into a pyramid scheme and even tricked friend and former teammate wes welker into believing he was suffering from schizophrenia i could write a book on this guy declared the assistant when asked if he thinks the kicker is still making these types of calls i would bet my kidney that he still doing it and i only

posted on tweet a major scuffle broke out between the incarnation of maharaja jai singh ii the original owner of jantar mantar and delhi chief minister arvind kejriwal on saturday over the rights to use jantar mantar however the property dispute was later resolved when mr kejriwal decided to leave the place and protest at red fort maharaja jai singh ii who built jantar mantar in had reincarnated in and has been keeping an eye on his property for the past few decades from a tea stall across the road he was delighted to see tourists from all over the world coming in to admire the structure he constructed and his self esteem had hit an all time high when he learned from the tea stall owner that his jantar mantar is one of the most popular tourist attractions in india however for the past few years he started to become a bit wary of a muffler clad gentleman sneaking into the premise on a regular basis with a group of people initially he gave him the benefit of the doubt assuming they were just a group of theater artists hired by the administrators to entertain the tourists but soon he realized that the man was popping up almost every day damn even i didnt come here that often when i was the king grumbled mr singh and on saturday when mr kejriwal sauntered to jantar mantar again after breakfast he said enough is enough and decided to confront him he patiently waited at the gate and when mr kejriwal was leaving the ground after dharna he stopped him and asked what are you doing here mr kejriwal was dumbfounded by the question he was not expecting anyone to question his rights to enter the place he belongs to and he mumbled umm protesting we ahem he cleared his throat and said we are protesting fine but why here this is the place where we come to when we have to protest this is where magic happens go and protest elsewhere where else can we go protest in your house your office or go to jnu but stay away from my property your property does this place have an owner yes i own this place hello this is our official protest venue and we will protest here mr singh lost his cool he grabbed him by the collar and pushed him to the ground oh i get it a modi agent said kejriwal a hint of rabid glee on his face go and tell your boss that kejriwal is not scared of anyone he hollered the news spread like wildfire and aap supporters started tweeting about how modi is not letting kejriwal work a few articles were hurriedly published about the emergency like situation created by modi meanwhile a couple of policemen heard the commotion at the ground and rushed to the scene screaming ink attack ink attack no but its an attack on democracy he is not letting me protest here kejriwal pointed to jai singh but why cannot he protest he lives here one of the policemen asked maharaja jai singh and then turned to kejriwal and inquired you own this place right umm no then no i mean there are open spaces ideal for protests and no one stops us so then you cannot use this place asserted the police inspector if delhi police were under the control of aap i wouldve suspended you and this guy wouldve been behind the bars you mean he wouldve been giving company to your mlas they giggled kejriwal glared daggers at the policemen fine i am leaving i will go to red fort why do you need to protest at historical places because i will create history he avowed and left for red fort he was later seen at red fort practicing independence day speech from the ramparts

louis t mcfadden louis t mcfadden louis t mcfadden was a member of the house of representatives in the twenties and thirties he was the chair of the house banking and currency committee during the twenties he used his position in congress occasionally to crusade against the federal reserve mr chairman we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks the federal reserve board a government board has cheated the government of the united states out of enough money to pay the national debt the depredations and the iniquities of the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks acting together have cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over this evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the united states has bankrupted itself and has practically bankrupted our government it has done this through defects of the law under which it operates through the maladministration of that law by the federal reserve board and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it louis t mcfadden june at one point mcfadden started impeachment proceedings against the entire board of the federal reserve not too surprisingly there were three attempts on mcfadden life one shooting and two poisonings the second of which was cuccessful although still officially declared as heart failure newspapers of the time reported now that this sterling american patriot has made the passing it can be revealed that not long after his public utterance against the encroaching powers of judah it became known among his intimates that he had suffered two attacks against his life the first attack came in the form of two revolver shots fired at him from ambush as he was alighting from a cab in front of one of the capital hotels fortunately both shots missed him the bullets burying themselves in the structure of the cab he became violently ill after partaking of food at a political banquet at washington his life was only saved from what was subsequently announced as a poisoning by the presence of a physician friend at the banquet who at once procured a stomach pump and subjected the congressman to emergency treatment president john f kennedy as president john f kennedy understood the predatory nature of private central banking he understood why andrew jackson fought so hard to end the second bank of the united states so kennedy wrote and signed executive order which ordered the us treasury to issue a new public currency the united states note kennedy united states note click for larger kennedy united states notes were not borrowed from the federal reserve but created by the us government and backed by the silver stockpiles held by the us government it represented a return to the system of economics the united states had been founded on and was perfectly legal for kennedy to do all told some four and one half billion dollars went into public circulation eroding interest payments to the federal reserve and loosening their control over the nation five months later john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas and the united states notes pulled from circulation and destroyed john j mccloy john j mccloy president of the chase manhattan bank and president of the world bank was named to the warren commission presumably to make certain the banking dimensions behind the assassination were concealed from the public kennedy e o has never been repealed and is still in effect although no modern president dares to use it almost all of the current national debt has been created since as we enter the eleventh year of what future history will most certainly describe as world war three we need to examine the financial dimensions behind the wars towards the end of world war two when it became obvious that the allies were going to win and dictate the post war environment the major world economic powers met at bretton woods a luxury resort in new hampshire in july of and hammered out the bretton woods agreement for international finance the british pound lost its position as the global trade and reserve currency to the us dollar absent the economic advantages of being the world go to currency britain was forced to nationalize the bank of england in the bretton woods agreement ratified in in addition to making the dollar the global reserve and trade currency obligated the signatory nations to tie their currencies to the dollar the nations that ratified bretton woods did so on two conditions the first was that the federal reserve would refrain from over printing the dollar as a means to loot real products and produce from other nations in exchange for ink and paper basically an imperial tax that assurance was backed up by the second requirement which was that the us dollar would always be convertible to gold at per ounce the bretton woods resort new hampshire the federal reserve being a private bank and not answerable to the us government did start overprinting paper dollars and much of the perceived prosperity of the and was the result of foreign obligations to accept the paper notes as being worth gold at the rate of an ounce then in france looked at the huge pile of paper notes sitting in their vaults for which real french products like wine and cheese had been traded and notified the united states government that they would exercise their option under bretton woods to return the paper notes for gold at the per ounce exchange rate the united states had nowhere near the gold to redeem the paper notes by the imf estimated foreign central banks held billion u s dollars however the united states had only billion in gold to redeem those paper notes so on august richard nixon temporarily suspended the gold convertibility of the us federal reserve notes nixon
