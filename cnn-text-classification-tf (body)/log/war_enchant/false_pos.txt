thanksgiving by the core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores a national consecration of the a balm and benediction for the a blessing of the fruits of murder and and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day by this article originally appeared in the issue of the black which and edited nobody but celebrates thanksgiving it is reserved by history and the intent of the founders as the supremely white the most ghoulish event on the national calendar no of the imagination can rival the reality that was the and remains the of the thanksgiving it is the most day of the year a pure glorification of racist barbarity we at are thankful that the day grows nearer when the almost four abomination will be deprived of its reason for white supremacy then we may all eat and drink in peace and gratitude for the blessings of deliverance from the rule of evil men thanksgiving is much more than a lie if it were that an historical correction of the record of events in would suffice to purge the flaw in the national mythology but thanksgiving is not just a twisted and the mythology it nurtures is itself inherently evil the events subsequently revised were perfectly understood at the time as the definitive triumphs of the genocidal project in new england the of native in soon from most of the remainder of the northern colonial seaboard was the true mission of the pilgrim enterprise act one of the dream slavery commenced contemporaneously an overlapping and ultimately inseparable act two the last act in the drama must be the root and branch eradication of all vestiges of act one and two seminal crimes and formative projects thanksgiving as presently celebrated that as a national political event is an affront to civilization celebrating the unspeakable white embraced thanksgiving because a majority of that population glories in the if not the unpleasant of genocide and slavery and on the good about their a cornucopia of privilege and national power children are taught to identify with the good fortune of the pilgrims it does not much matter that the native and holocausts that flowed from the feast at are hidden from the version of the story kids learn soon enough that were made scarce and became enslaved but they will also never forget the core message of the that the pilgrims were good who could not have purposely set such evil in motion just as the first thanksgivings marked the consolidation of the toehold in what became the united the core ideological content of the holiday serves to validate all that has since occurred on these shores a national consecration of the a balm and benediction for the a blessing of the fruits of murder and and an implicit obligation to continue the seamless historical project in the present day the thanksgiving story is an absolution of the whose brutal quest for absolute power in the new world is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human most the pilgrims are depicted as victims of harsh weather and their own nave yet wholesome visions of a new beginning in light of this carefully nurtured whatever happened to the from to and in the aftermath of the dinner must be considered a the result of misunderstandings at a series of lamentable tragedies the story provides the essential first frame of the saga it is unalloyed racist a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the pilgrims political in much the same way that mythology of a glorious past advanced another expansionist mission thanksgiving is quite dangerous as were the pilgrims rejoicing in a cemetery the their ostensibly religious venture backed by a trading were glad to discover that they had landed in a virtual cemetery in corn still sprouted in the abandoned fields of the but only a remnant of the local population remained around the fabled rock in a letter to bay colony founder john for

did prime actually read the full text of the resolution on and before he raved with i think this is a inconceivable he said it is not possible to continue with these resolutions at the and that aim to attack it is shocking and i have ordered that we stop taking this position even if it means diverging from the position taken by the rest of he added who became prime minister in at the relatively young age of knows exactly how the game is played in order to win favor with he must first please tel his country has abstained from the vote on a resolution that condemns violations of the cultural and legal status of occupied east this decision has ignited the ire of ambassador to who riled up the community in to protest the abstention in was converted into a champion of the temple the name uses to describe the holy site cravenly went on damage control mode without truly understanding the nature of the which merely condemned obvious violations of international and only calls for to respect the status of culture in the occupied city none of procedures that led to the vote on the resolution voted by with abstentions violated nor was any of the wording inconsistent with international law in was merely doing its attempting to protect and preserve the historical and cultural heritage of the world is a sacred and a holy city to a majority of simply because it is significant to the spiritual wellbeing of the adherents of the three monotheistic religions in the resolution stated affirming the importance of the old city of and its walls for the three monotheistic outburst is quite to say the for the eager politician simply tried to score cheap political points with thus the united states without a or even partial comprehension of what the resolution resolved nor did he seem aware of the fact that such text is largely a repeat of what has been discussed by the worlds leading cultural organization in and repeatedly before that date if anyone wants to say something about let them say but they should not use to say that the have no links to is like saying the sun creates he paraphrasing the sentiment displayed by the prime minister it would be rather sad if sees a mentor in for the latter is one of the least liked world leaders who has made a mockery of international forums and derided the united nations itself as and its process as theater of the absurd this is what had said in response to the resolution and shortly before he suspended his membership in using a language that is as amusing as his cartoon depiction of the nuclear bomb in his famous spectacle in he to say that has no connection to the temple mount and the western wall is like saying that china has no connection to the great wall of china or that has no connection to the pyramids other officials followed suit with a chorus of included who described the decision as an embarrassment for culture cut to the by labeling the resolution shameful and in it was neither in addition to odd the united states and other western governments reacted with exaggerated again without even addressing the situation on the which prompted the resolution and numerous other resolutions in the past in the first place even the parliament jumped on voting to condemn what they described as a sentiment i have read the resolution repeatedly to pinpoint the specific text that could possibly be understood by friends as to no avail the entirety of the text was based on past international international and refers to as the occupying as per the diktat of the conventions

email it was years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry title of babels collection of short stories written when the and former was with had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones for the backward this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a being forced

was the assault on the land that for the time being assuaged the peasants responding to an aggrieved the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as with a gray a black and wide red trousers with silver promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the cried lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get its on its last ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like raising from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he you are insulting this my dear answered with fierce conviction pure my dear and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus he stretched his magnificent his trousers girded by cords around the and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a penetrating licked some invisible command from his crimson and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this blossoming romeo her muzzle

throwing his reins to his the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap swirling off his operatic disappeared into the headquarters reading this story once again for the first time in i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like and he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse my early connections to modernism and my later connections to that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on th at the cinema village in new directed by who has a background as a sound it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of today as a possible trigger of according to babels multiple identity as communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by who is the grandson of babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work babel was executed for treason in having been charged with belonging to a group and spying for and babels wife who died at the age of in is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering she helped to design the subway system the obit ms recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director m and visits by foreign luminaries like and it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original revolution rather than to fall in line as a toady as he travels around encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in and the stories focus on gangsters living in an hardly the material expect to find written by a partisan of the revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to homo a me or i am and nothing of that which is human is alien to me although i have never read i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort
email rd is around the corner this day of the year may or may not mean something to you i consider it is a sad day for poetry on this day years ago the poet of left our world born on is not only the peoples poet of he is the poet of the people who love and beauty in his prolific showed that if we know the place where we come from we will have enough stories to tell for the rest of our lives he taught us that it is only by telling stories and paying attention to others stories that we truly live from the remote villages and treacherous mountains of wrote poems and stories whose words are like loaves of bread to feed the hungry his rhythms like raindrops falling on the endless deserts of the deprived souls his depth and clarity like clear spring waters from the melting snows of the mountaintops of some of his poems turn me into a bleeding red a singing wind on a long lonely a thunder loudly objecting every form of oppression on this planet others silence my vocal cords and sets free a stubborn tear hanging on the corner of my eye with his i turn into a into a wild flower on the side of a mountain into a shiny distant star on a silent and cold winter night is it a coincidence that died in the same year the land of poetry and was occupied and turned into rubble and the poet arrived to this world in the village of in the the name of the village means fire in the which reflects his own poetic fire that was neither tamed nor domesticated nor put out throughout the years of his life his poems capture the human soul that is like powerful yet also fragile and delicate in other ways as children of we are capable of doing so yet mother nature can crush our arrogance in a blink of an eye understood our delicate existence that can easily be crushed by the cruel rocks of reality yet our only bet is on our souls that enable us to fly high and far away reminding us of our strengths and he hit a bird with a the bird dies hit a stone with a the bird dies the son of the from the early years of his youth showed an extraordinary passion for oral village and everything the people of the mountains cherished and held dear and sacred his intellectual character is best captured in a version of an old saying that many mountain peoples worldwide one should only kneel down in two to drink clear water from a or to smell a wild flower this profound expression reminds us of the role of the intellectual in a world where everyone and everything is up for sale intellectuals can only kneel down to drink from the spring water of or to smell a wild flower whose scent would set their imagination free if we kneel down for any oppressive power even we may forever be and perhaps never able to stand up on our feet again tells us that he first picked the seeds of poetry from his mothers songs in the cradle he picked the fire of poems from his father who loved reading and writing in addition to working long and harsh hours in the fields from an early he was determined to capture the stories of his people to show the world that poetry transcends human and all artificial borders he once recalled his reacting to one of his early if you rummaged in the you might find at least a glowing amber i am sad to report that there is an embarrassing absence of the translations of particularly in the language this negligence is itself a form of censorship of works that may potentially humanize and change how we think about other people and cultures who inhabit our planet great works of literature from other places are not only censored by banning but even more so by silencing by refusing to translate them in the first place marginalization is the worst form of censorship and intellectual assassination choosing what gets translated into a certain language and what gets marginalized is a form of shaping and constructing the historical memory of a place according to whims of those who own the money and means of knowledge production but since the politics of translation is not the subject of this i will spare you more details lest i distort this poetic atmosphere to commemorate the th anniversary of i would like to take you on a journey in one of his most poetic books of all time titled my the originally written in the was first translated into in since then the book has been translated into many languages for those the only translation i was able to find is one from published by progress publishers in in this i will use the translation first published in in to share with you some of the countless gems leaves us with in this masterpiece from the very opening of the treats the reader as a guest upon entering his shall hopefully leave as a friend he opens it with what he titles instead of an introduction from the early the poet creates a harmony between writing and his beloved he writes that ideas and emotions are like mountain they come without without prior and there is no way for us to hide or escape from them when they arrive in the there are no important or unimportant guests the youngest of guests are equally important and honored even more than the oldest person in the simply because they are guests we receive guests at the doorstep without asking them where are you we take them to the center of the house and seat them on the near the fireplace adds that guests in the mountains
it was supposed to be an edgy thriller that made statements about upper echelon while also utilizing the real world sex life of tom cruise and as a kind of doorway bridging the gap between reality and fantasy something that does come up in other such as a space odyssey in this we have a statement about who runs the show the show is both the film as well as and wants viewers to realize that reality is run by our present of the the viewer is supposed to reflect upon the decadence of the eastern elite but also notice that viewing the film itself is homage to present social since the film is a wannabe voyeuristic step into the sex lives of others in this it functions as an initiation none of the other analysts and have really noticed this virtually every review i have read sees it as some elaborate mind control thing is supposedly everything on those while other reviews from professors and academia see it as a social or psychological commentary i think it has elements of all but the real goal i an initiation process the viewer is watching the film because he or she is curious about secrets and elite lives think of all the silly gossip magazines we have the average went to see the film for a glimpse of and wants the viewer to see the hypocrisy in such an given that most people will judge the films secret society cult eyes wide is a descriptor of the as well as the characters in the who really understand the power base that runs things the power base is according to the average politician or wealthy doctor or lawyer in new this is precisely and cruises characters they are unwitting inductees thus throughout the the viewers eyes are wide shut to the reality of the power just as and cruises characters until the when they have their eyes as they both say at the end let us proceed the opening scene shows us between two pillars this is the doorway to the in other words the two pillars figure prominently in freemasonry as the entrance way to the as borrowed from stands between two pillars and setting the initiatory tone for the film the two pillars of freemasonry borrowed from indicating the doorway to the mysteries the viewer is being told from the beginning that they are to undergo an initiation into how the mysteries and the secret societies particularly from a sociological perspective the we are having marital troubles related to sexual frustrations it is also significant that it is when the initiatory procedure takes as a kind of statement it is also important to remember that all details in a film are significant the placement of everything is meaningful and deliberate as mentioned in the picture the film is full of which are symbols of the the inner world as it as well as other worlds this occurs in in for and this as well as the wizard of both figure and are theosophical allegories most who note this point to it as some kind of control but i think that is more realistic would be the usage of such stories as allegories or metaphors for transformation the metamorphosis of initiation into the if you will both stories have theosophic undertones and and thus constitute initiatory tales as well when the arrive at the we see a clear symbol of what kind of initiation they are going to undergo a satanic as we see from the inverted the doors of their perception are about to change as they enter the party marked with an inverted pentagram invites the couple to his parties frequently under the auspices of eventually getting them to participate in the orgies as it turns there are two and old college nick plays piano for both both resist the temptation to sleep with other yet appear to have the desire given their own marital sexual problems what we continue to suspect is not that the events are randomly but rather that it has been organized it is not an accident that bill college buddy has shown up gets drunk and is then hit on by a wealthy is likely a reference to the founder and high priest of the church of i think this is a symbolic just to let us know the crowd they are being allowed to party with is ultimately an upper echelon satanic cult it is also interesting to note that the original story is written about a couple who undergoes the experience in upper class around the turn of the since is the origin of the actual members of the order of bill discovers that is involved in some shady and apparently has some connection to drugs and beauty queens a beauty queen we later is knocked out from drugs asleep and and we will find experience something similar has almost and tells her she cannot keep doing what she is we know if its a suicide attempt or not it is also interesting that the nude woman in the painting above is sprawled out in the same as if to allude to the films thesis of a thin borderline between fantasy or and reality we see the going about daily activities notice again the inverted pentagrams in the more inverted pentagrams pop up the then have a big argument over sex and the desire to and tells bill she once wanted to have sex with a young man years ago at a hotel throughout their condo we see images of gateways in indicating again that this is a film about initiation gardens also bring to mind and the expulsion of and eve due to or it could refer to their coming initiation into the garden of the so to as they are about to experience the underworld in bill then leaves to visit a patient who has passed and begins his languorous

the bloc may have won the but did win the by now it should be clear to all but the blindest rabidly that the united nations is an organization that has been by the nefarious interests of nations and their despotic third world allies it is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy an organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as today greatest purveyor of historical revisionism and conspiracy theories this fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by united nations and cultural organization that deny the indisputable nexus to the holy city on the body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly resolution that referred to holy sites in exclusively by their names and designated the temple holiest as a holy site of worship to add insult to the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that was planting fake graves in other spaces of the cemeteries the which was submitted by seven passed by a wide margin with votes in six against and abstentions two nations were absent for the vote and shamefully supported the vile resolution that the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner support and could thus claim a moral victory with its past and proclivity to kowtow to the worlds despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble but following the a crack appeared in the of invective so prevalent at the it appeared that was having a case of buyers remorse in an address to the prime minister termed the resolution clumsy and unfortunate he then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that will never deny the presence and history in it would make no it is absurd to deny this history is one of strongest advocates for the the authority and their allies at should have understood from statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic support instead of declaring victory and moving they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in the resolution sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the resolution it condemned for various contrived transgressions and again severed the nexus to the city this time the bloc was in for a rude awakening while the resolution the bloc was unable to garner a majority in the body of the nations that voted in favor of the resolution later withdrew support lowering the final tally to were composed of states with majorities while a is percent making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion what was notable was the fact that this time the resolution failed to garner a single western concurrence other developing like which had hitherto supported drafts also abstained political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the initiative was paying dividends following the resolutions the and their allies suffered additional political reversals asked for a because it wished to withdraw support for the motion secretariat of foreign affairs said in a statement that his governments changed position reiterates the recognition that the government of gives the undeniable link of the people to the cultural heritage of east soon followed suit echoing position in a the government noted that it would no longer support such resolutions which had went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future prime minister told an radio station that these resolutions were unacceptable and wrong he added that to say that the have no links to is like saying the sun creates darkness even voiced disapproval by stating that the heritage of is and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city she later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion on the authority and introduced a third draft resolution to world heritage committee seeking to generate further political terrorism the proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the nexus to the city and its holy sites the body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise and asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the bloc instead of the motion passing by the vote was in two eight abstentions and one nation absent the two nations opposing were and the of the seven were it was a victory at best given the large number of countries represented at the and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed but as evidenced by recent political gone are the days that the can rely on automatic and support has been effectively reaching out to the nations and it is having a significant positive impact part of the success lies in the fact that the state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water warfare and arms this outreach has translated to political dividends at the the resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many member states it also underscores the need for the united states to maintain its commitment and assurance to that it will never allow the to impose terms and dictates on there have been rumors circulating that in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on utilizing the security council the white house has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation the administrations objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed likely introduced by or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto in addition to betraying commitments to and running counter to strong bipartisan the notion that the united states would throw under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant to have a
mysterious universe as the season draws stories of strange experiences and supernatural hauntings ride and popular interest in haunted phantom other things deemed paranormal abound so far as the serious study of apparitions opinions about the concept of ghosts remains manifesting in a number of different folkloric motifs since earliest days ghosts are most often represented in cultural traditions as being spirits of the and legends often conjoin ghosts with death and the afterlife in equal traditions pertaining to belief in ghosts often view them as the stuff of or perhaps even as harbingers of to come this and the fear associated with belief in has especially been the case with ghost stories in we have little doubt that thanks can be attributed to tales of popular hauntings the likes of the horror to account for much of this such though supposedly based in some element of fact is often upon further are further vilified on the big making them the lasting stuff of horror cinema the attitudes more the biases that begin to emerge toward our ideas about ghosts in relation to cultural standards become once consideration beyond these lasting stereotypes is given in butler the the famed poet retold a number of ghostly legends recounted to him by the people of particularly an older gentleman identifies as an acquaintance named paddy in the chapter on village describes the belief that to have a ghost living within ones home is actually good a stark contrast when paired alongside the modern horror stories of the last few the house ghost is usually a harmless and creature it is put up with as long as possible it brings good luck to those who live with it i remember two children who slept with their mother and sister and brothers in one small room in the room was also a ghost they sold herrings in the and did not mind the ghost because they knew they would always sell their fish easily while they slept in the room harmless and usually the first terms that spring to mind in relation to ghost stories today go on to describe that some of the ghosts of were viewed as appearing before the death of or in the very most classic returning to fulfill unfinished

relationship with the some time ago i received an email from one of my who shared his own story of what he perceived may have been an encounter with the ghost of a i have a friend near who used to have a black cat the cat was old and eventually died in the house one after having drunk a cup of i was standing at the rinsing the coffee and out of the corner of my eye i saw her black cat deceased charging my like a kitten would i called to my friend and told her that her cat had just attacked my ankles she started laughing and assured me that her cat was dead i i told her her cat know she was yet somewhat in keeping with this idea of animal went on to discuss in the twilight how some traditions in hold that believed to be the spirits of dead may return in the form of various in the surrounding villages they adopt strange disguises a dead old gentleman steals the cabbages of his own garden in the shape of a large rabbit a wicked stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage in the shape of a making the most horrible noises he was only dislodged when the wall was broken then out of the sold plaster the snipe rushed away whistling nearby on the isle of which lays between and there is a strange bit of folklore about a family named who had been haunted by a voice which emanated from within the walls this occurred during the and the case was even investigated by the famous ghost researcher harry price around the time of the disturbance the strange twist to the story had been that the voice claimed it had belonged to a which had as a stowaway from and had been trained to

mysterious universe do other realities brush up against our are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some untraceable veil separating the idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to i have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at mysterious universe before and here i will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked whether intentional or not in the issue of fate magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in according to the in the fall of that year a woman by the name of golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her in the elevator was and when made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one that was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at but rather an expansive train station the enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air there seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before the confused made her way to an information booth to ask where she but found that the woman working there completely ignored as if she there at all followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street and she emerged out into a sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than in a place that was most certainly not she wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her at some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even and approached him wondering what was going on the boy was able to actually see and respond to and looked in her the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this surreal place as she the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to smiled slightly and purportedly i guess they let you off at the wrong too the two lost people walked together down the street in the whole time completely ignored by those around and the boy told of what had happened to him he claimed that he had been playing tennis in in the united and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes when he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train which had turned out to be the exact same station into which had enigmatically entered from the elevator the two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary to one of the women was oddly her sister the women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to and her companion this encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the which did not seem so far and which he was confident he could reach yet even though he was a good swimmer it seemed that no matter how much he tried and pushed against the he was unable to draw any closer to the mysterious sandbar and he returned to shore in frustration it was then that the sandbar supposedly suddenly vanished into thin air closed her eyes in and and then was overcome by the sensation of floating through space after some time of this odd feeling of hovering in darkness she claimed that she suddenly opened her eyes to find herself sitting atop a stool in the music store in which seemed to be in the process of closing for the suggesting that she had been there for at least several hours looked around for her but could not find him and decided to head back to his home when she her was noticeably relieved and explained that he had lost her in the store and had waited for her to come to the right floor for a few hours before deciding to go back home the whom had seen on the mysterious sandbar claimed that she had seen in town and had even called out to but that she had been too absorbed in talking to a young boy to notice her where did go during that why should she see her sister on a sandbar while the sister had seen her in all while they could not reach across to were they separated by strange barriers we do not and may not ever it is a mystery another strange article in the issue of fate magazine tells of the weird experience of a e of who in was traveling home with her husband and four children from a weekend trip to on the way they noticed what looked

so the band has done a group of individuals has started to write music and playing shows it is corralling friends and family in a crowded bar and blasting them with the sonic abilities of the new members of the musical group have started posting and setting up a and even a twitter account at some being a good band is not enough to bring in new fans all musical groups arrive at the crossroads where they have to make a decision on where to record their of the recording industry there are many options compared to the recording industry years ago in previous there were not many choices there were a handful of studios that catered to any all and solo artists the quality was top of the it was expensive to especially for starving artists but with the digital things have changed it seems that anyone can stumble upon dozens of small studios within the area among all the who can be trusted with original and even more what is the right balance of expense and digital recording became the industry everything was done on reels or with and it was expensive to produce an album that is no longer the case for less than with a little bit of practice and a creative music studio can be at home is this really the right option for artists the answer is simple sort artists might look forward to tirelessly editing track after track to make that perfect cut they might be robbing the band of the actual gains from a musical engineer sometimes having an unbiased ear that is not married to the guitar player is the insight needed to turn a song from mediocre to a hit most musicians forget this factor when they begin building a studio for options part of the price of using a professional studio is the benefit of an engineer who cares about the project and offers a creative element to a song the band has been playing for the last few years if the group decides not to purchase an pro tools for and learn the engineering side of there is still that big question which is the right studio for the studios will always be able to craft great sound with their they can stay on new some programs cost as much as and have access to the newest and hottest electronic toys on the market most musicians are worried that while more professional studios can produce great will it be an accurate representation of the groups style and be that have access to all the gear and software to produce great sounding demos or albums can do so because of their sheer volume of customers they may not be unable to give every project the time it deserves musicians may find themselves bound to a setting where the engineer does not even listen to the genre the band is or maybe even hates it some musicians feel that paying someone to is not enough to put their dreams in someone hands it the studio is not the right then the digital age and loads of free software like reaper and garage home studios have blown up all over it seems like anyone with a handful of microphones and a computer is a they can be found on through referrals from fellow or maybe it is even a best buddy from grade school are these small studios going to have the talent to take the band to the next to look for when reviewing a small studio is the engineer running the studio out of his living room or his parents after how can who wants to charge not able to afford an actual place to and more create the desired smaller places like this may be significantly cheaper but may not have the resources necessary to produce the desired regardless if they are a fan of the band and style is the engineer has gone to school or been involved in an apprenticeship what makes them qualified to produce an being there are many famous people who have fantastic talents behind the and the the lowest price in the world is not worth anything if the group signs up to record with a producer who has little or no idea what they are doing listened to previous work they have recorded have they produced anything like the genre and sound of the what is the quality of their there is no right answer when looking for the perfect studio for a but there are plenty of options whether it be a local staple a smaller less expensive or create a home there is one thing that is almost guaranteed to happen most musicians will never be satisfied with their the drummer could have done this the singer was or a guitar player was just a fraction out of tune most while dissecting the demo or after thousands of some sort of imperfection will be discovered it is something fans will not like a slight problem or a fade that should have gone just a little is important that no matter where the music is musicians go prepared have realistic expectations of what the end product will sound like from a qualified engineer this is the best way for the band to feel their money was not wasted on a great project that sounds experience from business music courtesy of page creative commons license bands music recording studio

by health impact staff and say they are heartbroken they say their children are heartbroken also their children are remaining in state even though there are no abuse or neglect and even though the children are suffering and want to come home the children remain in public school and state despite judge harts previous ruling to allow the children to be see previous judge allows mother to her own children denies request to vaccinate children while in state custody judge hart ruled on that the children should continue to while in state custody for purposes of consistency to keep the children in the same school setting they were in before entering state custody since they will continue to be once they go and added that the children would be going home according to when cps defied judge harts ruling to allow the children to continue to the were certain that judge hart would have no option but to send the children home on and punish the social workers who defied his ruling see previous cps defies judges order to keeps children in public school but when they went to court on the said it was like judge hart was a completely different person than he had been during the adversary hearing in and rather than dealing with cps refusal to the the hearing focused only on presenting a lengthy list of services the must complete before they can get their children home and out of public school and state custody with some of his children during a cps supervised visit and maintain that their children should never have been taken into state custody in the first and that the list of cps services they must now complete are a not only a waste of but also a waste of since there never was any abuse or and cps allegedly never even substantiated any of their allegations although there were some supervision concerns since their old escape artist got into the front yard momentarily without their the say that their daughter getting into the yard alone was an accident could happen to any and once they learned of locks were immediately added to the garage doors to prevent any further escapes the are outraged that their lives have been turned upside their children abused and traumatized in state their reputation slandered in the and the main who called cps and started this entire ordeal is not even a credible according to the caller that called cps to begin ended up changing her story several times under oath was discovered to be a manufacturer who sells is a felon with a long criminal record that may have been on drugs when she made that cps report that started this nightmare children remain in custody as recalled that at the close of the adversary hearing on judge hart declared that he saw nothing to necessitate terminating parental and that his only concerns were some supervision issues that could be easily fixed even though there was no substantiated abuse or judge hart ruled that the children had to remain in saying his hands were tied because the family left in before bringing the children in for cps even though there was no court order preventing the family form leaving the and they allegedly did nothing illegal by doing so the explain that they left to protect their children from the overzealous cps worker who was harassing them at home and traumatizing the children the also contend and they have spoken with attorneys who agree that the children were illegally extradited from back to according to the cps has defied judges broken and committed perjury over and yet they suffer no consequences the who claim their only wrongdoing was making a mistake and not noticing when their followed continue to suffer at the hands of a corrupt system are the being made an example of because they left and exposed corruption within the family believes that judge harts ruling to keep the children in state care is retaliation because the they continue to expose the corruption of cps and the family court system studies have shown that children are worse off in foster homes than if they remained in a troubled and many argue that foster care itself is a form of child causing emotional trauma for children in despair for her i think my body could make this many tears their joy is gone their happy faces are sad now oh heavenly please lord please let anything happen to are they living with genuinely abused kids that are acting out towards my husband i are supposed to just sit hands tied not help were to hang tight knowing that abused kids possibly sicko adults are living amongst them in the heavily populated group for more information on grim foster care the foster care modern day slavery and child trafficking no consequence for cps defying it was shocking to the that cps could get away with defying the judges previous ruling about homeschooling their children according to cps said that they tried to find a curriculum but were unsuccessful they mentioned something about a schooling option to do at the foster homes but that each kid had to have a laptop in order to do it so it was not an option they say they also said that they spoke to homeschooling coalition that they offer anything that would allow cps to take the kids to for their schooling they said that they find a foster family willing to the children they said that the kids are doing really well in school they said that they having any behavioral issues they said that the schools have reported that the brighten up the that they enjoy having them as students they said that the kids are enjoying except for was heartbroken that judge hart would not even let her

print this post any professional who is prepared to speak the truth and go against the medical establishment in a shaken baby case should also be prepared to lose their career as a consequence image via the telegraph by england health impact news wins her appeal but banned from telling the truth in court in march after being publicly humiliated and having her career torn to shreds by the general medical council pediatric and expert defense witness was found guilty of misleading her being dishonest and bringing the reputation of the medical profession into disrepute if the thought that that was the end of the then they were because less than eight months was back to appeal their and this she was not alone over three hundred scientists and lawyers write letter of protest after she had been discredited months scientists and lawyers rallied together in her and in an unprecedented move had written a letter of protest to the medical journal questioning the decision the reporting on the her supporters believe it is unprecedented to have so many distinguished scientists writing to the in support of a doctor signatories include prof peter the doctor who cut cot sir the pioneer of and prof an internationally renowned pathologist professionals were not the only ones demanding because since their the have been bombarded with petitions and letters from parents and supporters from all over the world one extremely powerful written by protecting innocent families we are writing in the defense of a pediatric who was struck off the medical register this week for practicing outside her area of ignoring the opinions of her and bringing the reputation of the medical profession into disrepute with her testimony and written opinions in a series of shaken baby cases she helped defend between and we know from personal experience that the prevailing model of shaken baby syndrome is a fact that is also supported by literature although shaking an infant can cause serious injury and the presence of the and retinal findings now associated with shaken baby syndrome does not prove which is the vital message brings to the debate we are dismayed that the council is sanctioning her for having the courage and intellectual honesty to express her own which are not popular but which are founded on solid scientific thinking and the best available evidence many of these diagnoses are based on the presence of findings retinal and that can be associated with a number of medical conditions and accidental trauma as well as inflicted injury it is a logical error to conclude that because abuse can cause the the presence of the findings proves abuse after writing several more equally powerful the authors continued by adding the declaration also scolds unfairly for her citations of the medical research in one she cited the early research of and colleagues shaken baby a and journal of neurosurgery to support her observation that shaking without impact has not been shown to generate sufficient forces to cause brain injury the panel wrote that had completely misinterpreted what had actually a conclusion that baffles us the paper was a landmark in the because it was the first attempt to test shaking theory and the results surprised even the who it was concluded that severe head injuries commonly diagnosed as shaking injuries require impact to occur and that shaking alone in an otherwise normal baby is unlikely to cause the shaken baby syndrome the signed by a total of outraged parents and ended with this final is a brilliant physician whose work is internationally known and respected by the scientific with the exception of child abuse experts her professional writing is founded in science and the scientific method her and probity are beyond reproach it appears that the overwhelming support for this professional has had the desired because in won her appeal win tinged with sadness despite winning her as there was a and although name was returned to the medical she has been prevented from giving evidence as an expert witness for another three which many believe was her punishment for standing up to the establishment in a statement to the daily mail i have been through hell for nearly seven years and i am so grateful to my fellow friends and family for their understanding and forbearance during this long and difficult period i am relieved that my honesty is no longer questioned and that i can put my name back on the medical but i feel very resentful about what has happened i have been targeted and singled out by the metropolitan police because i have challenged the accuracy of shaken baby syndrome civil rights lawyer described case as a witch hunt and told the daily mail she is still not being allowed to contest the underlying lack of evidence for shaken baby syndrome this eliminates true science from the courtroom his words are spot it is a shame that he did not mention the fact that when had previously

print email set about to prove how foolish the whole idea of reincarnation was by conducting a scientific investigation of her own in the questioned middle class subjects from while they were under hypnosis the subjects were asked to regress to a former life if this was they were told to remember everything when they awoke from their hypnotic state not satisfied to just ask who they were or when they also made them describe their tools they their housing and even the food they the subjects frequently reported viewing the former lives much like watching a movie they said they could experience whatever the individual experienced in that particular time they heard ancient languages but did not understand them the full details of their experiences were recorded both during and after the sessions never before had past life inquiries been that specific or involved such a large population the results of her years of research surprised everyone the detailed reports were thoroughly investigated to see if they corresponded with historical facts in all but cases than the descriptions were totally accurate some of the results are as of the past lives reported were male and were female this is exactly in accordance with biological fact reported class or status was exactly the same proportion as the estimates of historians of the specific period of the former life in this was approximately upper from the middle class and the remaining from the lower class although the proportion of middle class was higher around the proportion later dropped and increased again after ad recall by subjects of type of food and utensils used was better than that in popular history books she found over and over again that her subjects knew better than most historians when she went to obscure experts her subjects were invariably correct a subject who lived around in described different types of clothing worn by the upper and lower classes the upper classes wore either a or white cotton robe the lower classes wore something like an type of pants that was wrapped downwards from the waist the researchers viewed historic records of clothing worn during the respective periods and could therefore compare it to the descriptions of these subjects the descriptions were found to be correct of the ancient population lived at or below the poverty level they wore home made clothes and lived in even abodes the majority were farmers who labored every day in the fields none of the hypnotized individuals recalled being a famous historical figure those who recalled a high social position seemed highly dissatisfied with their as if it was a burden to be alive those who recalled being a farmer or a member of a primitive tribe appeared to be content recollections were from different geographic areas and races during their prior life divided them into several blacks and middle eastern descent around only of the subjects reported that they were they lived widely dispersed throughout what is now known as the middle the and central called the central steppe during historical subjects stated that they lived in central between and they recalled living in which was common to the migrating population of that region they found themselves to have white skin color and yellow or golden at this did appear to be historically accurate as people should have black hair and darker skin recent discoveries of mummified corpses along the ancient spice route have shown that there were indeed light skinned and blond haired habits of people who lived around b c were not that bad twenty percent of the subjects recalled that they ate poultry and sheep meat between to people eating habits were rather poor the subjects recalled that the food was tasteless one young man will never it is not surprising that those who recalled the best tasting food were those who remembered a prior life in china all the died of old age and percent died violently during or some other catastrophe and the remaining died in accidents many of the prior lives ended during the two world as well as civil wars in countries these people reincarnated shortly after they died we will see more evidence for this in our next striking example found that of the subjects who had died during the were while between and only were it seems that transmigration of the different races increased after this is still not understood went on to publish her findings in the evidence under hypnosis and life before life although she began her work as a she would later and genetic memory could not account for the patterns that emerged in the results with the exception of all descriptions of and utensils were consistent with historical and in later she i do believe in reincarnation i know as we mentioned in the results suggest that reincarnation usually happens shortly after death in the next example we will see an amazing case that saw a reincarnated woman who was able to be reunited with her husband and son after remembering her former life at the age of years this famous case was thoroughly studied by both believers and skeptics of reincarnation including the famous religious mahatma

from monster to democrats grovel before trump by information clearing house within a day of the election of leading democrats have moved with extraordinary speed to declare their support for the invited trump to the white house for a friendly meeting on he declared afterwards that his priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our is successful he speaking to i want to emphasize to that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you if you then the country declaration stands in stark contrast to his own statements just a few days ago then he asserted that trump appears to only care about himself and know basic facts that need to know to be president he added that trump spent years on this earth showing no regard for working was before the democratic debacle on election day now he declares his highest priority to be ensuring that trump is comments followed the statement by on that she hoped will be a successful president for all senator the supposed issued his own groveling to the degree that trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this i and other progressives are prepared to work with such the democrats are in effect abandoning any pretense of acting as an opposition party to a president trump and a proclamations of support from top democrats are made in relation to an individual whose election clearly marks a watershed in politics what is coming to power is a government of the extreme with fascistic characteristics there are reports that trump wants to appoint as his chief of staff the head of an and fascistic media outlet his top advisors and likely cabinet appointees include reactionary figures such as former new mayor and new jersey governor their rush to lend the transition of power an aura of the democrats and the media have maintained a studious silence about certain quite striking elements of the one is noting that a principal factor in the election of trump was a significant decline in voter turnout for all of the media talk of a surge of white working class voters behind the republican candidate actually received one million fewer votes than mitt received in losing the election to won million fewer votes than won in his when the outgoing president obtained significantly fewer votes than he had received in also virtually ignored is the extraordinary fact that trump failed even to win the popular vote had a higher percentage of the national but she lost in the electoral which involves a complex and antidemocratic apportionment based on victories in individual states trump will take office having failed to secure a let alone a of the overall the entire history of the united there have been only five elections in which the incoming president did not win the popular vote when this happened in the b became though he had fewer votes than the j the political conflict over the outcome was so intense that the republicans were able to hold the white house only after agreeing to the effective end of war through the withdrawal of federal troops from the a split vote in when grover lost to the winner of the electoral vote was also the winner of the popular vote for the next years in the this anomaly has now happened and again in in the former the selection of w bush as president required the intervention of the supreme court to halt the recount of ballots in trump found himself in the position of he would have taken his time before conceding his concession when and if it would have stressed that he had won the popular vote and that crooked could not claim a media message would have stressed the need for to be conciliatory and acknowledge that the majority of the voters had chosen trump one can easily imagine announcing the breaking news that had withdrawn the nomination of choice for the supreme court and invited the republicans to name the replacement for the deceased the democrats have done just the is behind this universal president said perhaps more than he intended when he declared that we have to remember that were actually all on one team this is an intramural a test competition involving players from the same united states does not really have an oppositional political system the divisions between the democrats and and between and are of an entirely tactical character they all defend the same basic of the corporate and financial aristocracy that controls the political this the democrats are always the more accommodating and conciliatory since their rhetorical references to defending the interests of working by the likes of thoroughly vacuous and insincere in relation to trump and the dangers he there is an element of complete which arises from the fact that the danger is not to the democrats or the privileged social forces for which they but to the working chief concern of the democrats is to contain popular anger their moves to circle the wagons around trump are above all a response to the danger they see of the emergence of popular opposition that threatens not only the incoming but the capitalist system as sanders and company prostrate themselves and pledge their loyalty to thousands of youth and workers are demonstrating around the country against the these protests are only a pale and politically disparate foretaste of mass struggles of the working class that are to is critical is that the lessons of the election be drawn and all attempts to keep opposition to war and austerity chained to the political corpse of the democratic party be rejected the task is not to take back the democratic party or push it to the inevitable result of that false perspective has already been demonstrated in the reactionary outcome of the sanders to break with both parties of
the foul stench of fascism in the may be shocked by the election of trump but black and brown smelt it throughout this summer and i have interviewed fellow asking them about their feelings and experiences regarding this presidential election in all of these one thing was we knew this was some of it hung like a foul smell in the air the acrid stench that generations before somehow learned to live though it choked them many of us coughed and spluttered when that suffocating air filled our lungs some of us cried out in when those of us who spoke up were heard at we were greeted with or with laughter like some i wrote about that were given the assurance that there were some for whom that acrid stench was a breath of fresh but those foolish people were few and unimportant we were told the smell would go away on its own it went nowhere it lingered and it got for some of it was more than a smell for some unlucky ones such as it became a physical parked his car in my beloved town of hood to take his dog for a walk as told the town started to get out of the and heard someone the car door smacked my head and then my head hit the door frame i lost part of my memory for about news of the assault hit our small it shocked us all we had a hard time believing especially when reported that the only other words he heard were you is not a he is a monk in typical monk his response was filled with am happy it happened to me and not to a he ca feel safe in a third of my own in my we spoke at length about the assault and what it meant by we had already seen that racism and white nationalism were on the rise the fact that an innocent monk was attacked at all was but that he was attacked for being something he for being nothing more than not was what really my town assumed it was isolated we assumed there was a small minority of people filled with assumed that the smell would go away on its news stories abounded about white people verbally or physically attacking and people with disabilities many people mostly white allies thought that it was rare not something to worry did believe that for a is a black designer who was living in in but was returning to his native white girlfriend and i are moving back to this he told me had originally planned to drive across the country and stop in new and phoenix needless to we not doing that any and his girlfriend took an plane instead too many stories of white backlash attacks in too many disparate places made them cancel their was jokingly worried about being opinionated in the south before this he said it untenable it incredibly sad that in i ca feel safe in a third of my own is not alone by many minority people in had already changed their and outlook marina an artist from began to avoid eye contact with people on the metro when someone looked at her and people are so experiences with actions and violence have existed before but have gotten the attention they getting now social media makes sharing these experiences easier than ever so things encountered kept to but with and twitter talking about with people throughout the i saw this pattern repeated minority people of various and racial groups were all doing the same were talking about the foul smell in the pointing out the real danger to anyone who would and they were all being more cautious around white people many of them changed their in subtle ways wear headphones more at work said a white lesbian woman who wants to remain anonymous for fear of a backlash at the legal practice where she works outside i just want to avoid the chance of getting into was being verbally assaulted and called because she spoke about wanting to marry her partner even in national symbol of a lesbian woman felt afraid to argue for her right to a marriage that the state had already given a black writer and actor in who did not want his real name had a somewhat similar take on avoiding arguments when he talked about the police goal is not to win the he told me goal is to get home happens to be tall and his car is fitted with special gearing to allow him to drive only with his hands it is a car that only someone his size can a white cop pulls me over one he told is looking me up and looking at my insurance and my and he asks me this your i what is that question supposed to we all know what it supposed to mean you looking at my and i have a car only i can drive i know why you asking that but not going to say because the goal is to get home so i just say sir it is white men are taking back to the i heard similar responses throughout the summer and minority people universally spoke of this election as a they spoke of being scared white people universally saw it as an accidental event that would just that could really happen warned us of exactly that sentiment a political writer who studied has written of the seriousness of this election in numerous telling us that ca happen is exactly how fascism happens her essays are like a plan for how to avoid a yet it seems that no one wanted to bring her map on this i warned us writing that are on the cusp of a historic decision in the us we can make history and transition from the first black to the first female

by brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election there are some observations which deserve attention these unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of and the election demonstrated perhaps better than and better than has been generally been that a plutocracy it took a genuine a a man with a lifetimes economic to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well with money for their ambitions it was the well of drilled by bill with help from some extremely shady such as that made the keystone establishment figures in the democratic party it was not personal charm or exceptional political in his displayed some of both of earned the their it was the the mothers milk of politics in what is euphemistically called fund many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by bill efforts fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence she lacked bills superficial but she certainly more than shared his ambition on the charm when she was ready to move into running for she perhaps under bills a kind of forced clown face with arched and a smile as big as her lips would and these expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various or waving whenever she campaigned her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a parade or of the late at his most exuberant these were not natural for her they were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive both in a governors mansion and later in the white bizarre because she indulged her husbands predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more and successful knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in politics she determined to build a political war chest long and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed as when running for the when sources of big money suggested another view would more acceptable she was anything but constant in the views she embraced because when she ran for the senate she spent record amounts of embarrassingly large amounts in her years of speaking she aimed at special interests who could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees in the appointed post of secretary of as it into personal contact with every head of government or international unquestionably played an aggressive pay for play with them all covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about a second big fact of the election is that both major political parties are rather sick and fading the republican party has been broken for a very long time it hobbled along for some decades with the help of various hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like family public prayer and catering to the and burning constitutional and now it is truly out of gas that is precisely why a political outsider like oligarch trump could manage to hijack the party he was opposed by boring men like seeking to secure an almost inherited and a intensely phony fundamentalist like and it proved to be no contest it was a remarkable political but i think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party the republican party had been given a some new by in the he had an extremely mixed record as but he was held in some and did have a clear but his effect on the party was not lasting trump could be seen as another but i think the comparison is superficial trump literally hijacked the and he was not deliriously crowned by its establishment the press was too busy attacking him from the start to take notice or do any intelligent and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the establishment he represented his most promising quality is his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the wars vigorously embraced and would expand but the democratic party is in serious too it has a great deal of internal as the material from the clearly shows us lack of ignorance of the people it has always claimed to bad and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms the material tells us about many internal including harsh judgments of resentment over the character of daughter who is said to resemble in her behavior and and the belief of some that just should not have run she had become for many a rather figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected but they not only blindly supported they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable sanders sanders might well have been able to win the election for the but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy after there were bill and beckoning to their running well of money in it might be just as well that sanders was cheated out of the nomination he proved a weak individual in the giving in to just the forces he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down he may well even have been secretly bribed by money from the since he bought a fairly expensive property not long afterward in any there he out on the supporting everything he ever opposed personified in men of that nature do not stand up well to generals and admirals and the heads of massive a quality

success workshops in community colleges nearly doubled graduation rates and and baker show that telephone coaching by inside track professionals boosts college retention by across several institutions while support can have large effects on student it is often costly to implement and difficult to scale up to the student population at large noting this we set out to build on recent advances in and investigating whether technology and text and email messaging can be used to generate comparable benefits to coaching interventions but at lower costs among university students and several recent studies in find that appropriately timed interventions can have lasting effects on student outcomes and and relatively large improvements on academic performance have been documented from interventions that help students define their goals or purpose for learning et et teach the growth mindset idea that intelligence is malleable et and help students keep negative events in perspective by their values and in contrast to these other studies in education and economics attempt to maintain contact with students or their parents at a low cost by using technology to provide consistent reminders aimed at improving outcomes providing and phone call updates to parents about their students progress in school has been shown to boost both parental engagement and student performance and kraft and rogers mayer et while direct communication with college and university students has been used in attempts to increase financial aid renewal and page and improve academic outcomes and can alternatives to coaching be we examine whether benefits comparable to those obtained from coaching can be achieved at lower cost by either of two specific interventions and we examine a intervention designed to affirm students goals and purpose for attending and a text and email messaging campaign that provides weekly reminders of academic advice and motivation to students we work with a sample of more than undergraduate students who are enrolled in introductory economics courses at a large representative college in randomly assigning students to one of three treatment groups or a control group the treatment groups consist a exercise completed during the first two weeks of class in the the intervention plus text and email messaging throughout the full academic and the intervention plus coaching in which students are assigned to undergraduate students who act as coaches students in the control group are given a personality test measuring the big five personality traits figure our main results on course grades we find large positive effects from the coaching amounting to approximately a increase in average course we also find that coached students experience a increase in in we find no effects on academic outcomes from either the exercise or the text messaging even after investigating potentially heterogeneous treatment effects across several student including incoming high school and whether students live on residence figure main effects of interventions our results suggest that the benefits of personal coaching are not easily replicated by interventions using technology many successful coaching involve regular interaction facilitated either by mandatory meetings between coaches and students or proactive coaches regularly initiating contact and and baker cook et et our coaches initiated contact and built trust with students over in person and through text messaging through a series of the coaches could understand the problems students were facing and provide clear ending most conversations with students being able to take at least one specific action to help solve their current problems our text messaging campaign offered weekly academic resource and but did not initiate communication with individual students about specific issues help with writing or an upcoming the team often invited students to reply to messages and share their concerns but was unable to do this with the same efficacy as a nor were we able to establish the same rapport with students our inability to reach out to all students and softly guide the conversation likely prevented us from learning the important details of their specific problems although we provided answers and advice to the questions we we did not have as much information on the students backgrounds as our coaches and thus could not tailor our responses to each students specific circumstances our coaches were also able to build trust with students by

by with all the big and small that goes on in private we bothered calling out a practice that is pervasive and well known in the private equity community and authorized by the agreements that the limited partners sign with the general partners yet it will likely stick in the craw of most public pension fund the taxpayers who support the payments to those as well as donor to foundations and endowments that also invest in private equity even more than the widespread use of private which is authorized not just for firm employees but at some general even their family members another routine form of private equity rent extraction is how they get the fund who are to pay for lavish annual conferences which for the biggest funds includes big ticket entertainment like conference phoenix curling and for the still another source has confirmed that john performed at the conference and as is typical in limited partnership investors are on the hook for the costs of meetings and this as part of a limited partner was on their nickel the only limited partnership agreement we have is for a credit and debt investors they obtain control of a company via chapter or an out of court do not have direct control over portfolio companies that makes it harder for them to keep various charges opaque to limited partners by laundering them through portfolio companies the opportunities partners ii puts the cost of meetings squarely on the investors from numbered page section except as specifically set forth in section management the partnership shall pay for shall reimburse the management company for its payment all costs and expenses relating to the partnerships meetings advisory committee and current form adv is even clearer on this point each fund also generally bears all of the expenses relating to its meetings and eventual liquidation than expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of us or its general and the adv also specifies that can charge entertainment to portfolio which means limited partners have no idea how large the charges are in reimbursements from portfolio companies for expenses travel which include expenses for business or first class black car transportation and meals late night meals consumed at times when not we incur in connection with our performance of services for such portfolio consider what this means private jet use supposedly not because it is an egregious perk for masters of the but because their time is and sometimes those mere commercial flights get from awkward point a to awkward point b all that efficiently the other justification is the need for secrecy and the ability to work on a private jet the latter claim is pretty in light of the widespread industry practice of offering empty seats to supposed competitors if they happen to need a lift so private jet use is an practice that has become a bad norm by its hard to see lavish entertainment at supposed informational gatherings as anything other than a kickback to private equity investors as someone who is in the business of consuming and analyzing it is vastly more efficient to process written information than speeches or presentations and i both greatly prefer transcripts and can barely stand the time cost of listening to web presentations conferences are an even bigger time sink in other if the objective were to inform these events are clearly not necessary the limited partners are flattering themselves if they think they can learn anything more by seeing general partner execs or the team from their showcased portfolio companies in the flesh these are all highly skilled performers and these events are very carefully staged in advance so what are the limited partners aside from getting an excuse to visit new or other major and getting wined and the general partners are marketing to them this is an extended sales pitch to help groom them to invest in the next fund and its an opportunity to mix socially with other limited partners which is questionable as a use of the funds entrusted to them they can do that just as well at educational which are also neutral territory a former private equity fund executive pointed out that keeping private equity staff at pension funds and foundations busy with the nominally important work of running around to general partner meet and greets seriously eroded the time they could spend doing what ought to be their real of reading the financial information and other reports provided by the general partners as well as their sec form which it appears virtually no one in the industry bothers scrutinizing one academic told me that only encountered one investor who regularly read the of companies sold out of funds invested in to see if there was anything they anticipated so as to help them better evaluate future fund investments consistent with the thesis that general partner conferences were either by accident or design busywork to keep limited partners from digging into documents and this investor was in a remote part of and often go to investor confabs because the travel time was apparently too costly relative to the information yield one has to wonder how popular these general partner conferences would be if they instead featured dinners and focused on information conveyance the which by contrast are primarily networking featured long days am to with the lunch and dinner speakers covering substantive for years until the participants cried uncle and asked for a less exhausting schedule and these are people who have billions of dollars of funds at risk its not hard to imagine that if the general partners were dispensing as opposed to using investor monies to curry favor with see them using tried and true like public company quarterly earnings calls but as people trained in making presentations conventions like a darkened the use of visuals on having speakers on all give the speakers a power advantage over the audience and deter

how to consolidate power in a way that balances the interests of the government and the get an inside look at current political direct sat down with of the center according to the parliamentary elections provide a preview of what to expect in and to what extent were the parliamentary elections fair and in your in they were juridically legitimate because they were conducted in accordance with law the degree of the not juridical legitimacy is a debatable question because of the low it means that the representation of citizens in the parliament became even less than previously about of the population voted at the elections though the united ruling party garnered four million fewer votes than during the it received more seats in the parliament in liberal politicians are not included in the parliament at all the legitimacy of the elections is a matter of these elections were fair in the polling stations with to a large extent they were honest in the in which the central election commission controlled the electoral process in cooperation with observers a lesser these elections were fair and transparent in the distant regions or in the words of prominent political expert zones of peculiar electoral which saw an abnormally high electoral turnout i for the republic of in southern the north region etc regions were controlled by the central election commission to a much lesser extent no wonder that people were compelled to vote in accordance with the orders of local authorities the violations in these regions were likely to be common associate and chair of the domestic politics and political institutions program at the center press photo does central election commission have any tools to influence voting in the distant there are some but local authorities limit and restrict them i think the administration of the president hampered the work of the central election commission she tried to balance the interests of president and the interests of the civil society is the position and it is very difficult she just tried to take into account all positions and signals that were coming from the regions during the electoral campaign and could not ignore them there were so many of these signals that she objectively and physically could not control the throughout the in the distant regions what kinds of violations took place during the if violations took even though they were not like previously during the elections these violations included the use of administrative resources for rigged and fabricated stuffing the ballot and dirty political techniques against the liberal and communist parties during the political campaign and before election day was also orchestrated when students and governmental employees were ordered to vote this also should be taken into account all these violations took place not only in distant but also in those under the steady control of the central election why did the united party win despite its declining popularity throughout the fact the united won the majority in the state and the popularity are basically different things its popularity has been decreasing indeed it is one reality but it prevent the party from winning most of the seats that is the other reality citizens see the party as a body that deals with the problems of the population the credibility and approval rankings of almost all governmental except law enforcement agencies and the president are dropping and united is not the because people perceive it not as a but as a kind of a governmental body its rating will keep going but step by step if you vote for united it means a symbolic a sort of political ritual if you are and go to the polling you are likely to vote for united because it is necessary this is the very logic and motivation that drive average voters to elect united though some people preferred not to vote for the ruling they voted for the current because there were no real they voted either for one of the three systemic parliamentary parties or the spoiler which aimed at distracting the attention of voters and preventing the opposition from gaining parliamentary seats why did the opposition fail and what is its key the reason why they failed can be traced back to the personal ambitions of the opposition leaders they team up and compete with each other in they have different in fact i mean liberals and liberals always agree this does after all these leaders have enough political heft most of them cannot be considered powerful and influential political figures problem is that the authoritarian regime in will prevent the emergence of new powerful liberal forces in if such a party emerges and poses a serious challenge to the authorities like opposition leader it will be either destroyed or discredited and marginalized in such a it is very difficult to come up with a pragmatic solution this years parliamentary elections proved that the only political democratic force on a scale of a whole country is the party and its leader no matter how you view them it is losing popularity year after but this party remains firmly within the political landscape and if the opposition is able to persuade voters that brings together different representatives of

turnout remained well below the necessary percent of all valid although percent of voters more than three million people said they wanted the parliament to have a decisive say about any future redistribution of inside the referendum and its campaign had two separate goals the ruling party had to test the loyalty of their political thus they tried to redefine classical political fault lines and checked on the unity of the opposition prime minister used this occasion to bring forward his arguments about reshaping the competences of the especially the commission referendum question has been thoroughly debated ever since it was as it reflects both of the above goals the question you want the union to be able to order the mandatory settlement of citizens in without parliaments political and civil groups were enabled by the ambiguous wording of the question to focus on significantly different interpretations neither the constitutional court nor the national election committee declared the question despite the fact that it raised concerns among experts the constitutional rules within most member states declare that no national referendum should be held on issues already regulated by international a way of getting around this the government later claimed that the referendum did not concern the decisions of mandatory quotas already decided at the level of the council it would only concern future possible the competency of the the council is required to give the final word in any such case of distribution of resettlement or relocation among member in any

the attacks on but the referendum question undoubtedly raised the stakes of the debate it is not anymore about whether migrants or refugees should be welcomed or the opinion of the government focuses on the competence of the institutions whether they in enforce decisions on member position is openly on the side that the quota system violates the sovereignty of member states and unnecessarily forces a instead of paying attention to securing the external borders of the area this has been the argument already since last when hundreds of thousands of refugees crossed the country and the route towards the borders must be because if member states start the redistribution the political pressure for a sustainable solution at the border protection level would dissipate and would be left with an

leading authority on the technique that could help officials identify more distant relatives and track down criminals who are in the he said technology is demonstrable said pioneered the use of familial for crime solving more than a decade ago in one of the earliest detectives reopened the killing of a woman in wales and compared from the assailant to genetic profiles in database of known offenders in they got a partial match to a boy the teen was alive at the time of the but detectives used the clue to focus on his who eventually pleaded guilty to the murder despite that conviction and the technology took some time to catch on in the and was used only sporadically among its earliest uses was the arrest of the serial which came after officials subpoenaed a tissue sample from his daughter pap smear taken at a medical clinic times a familial test led to the arrest of l shown making a court appearance via video in the torture and serial murder case in by an impassioned debate on the technology was percolating at the capitol in gov jerry brown then the state attorney general began fielding letters and visits from urging him to consider using familial his were concerned

but the growing popularity of the technique has raised alarms for some privacy such as chief attorney for the forensic division of the office of the public defender mercer successfully lobbied for his

more than a few feel that as long as they can provide and basic medical needs for themselves and their nothing more is required other may feel that self power and machine repair are skills that will be required in the post crisis world many and also tend to ignore or underestimate the need to have a computer that can be used to help make it easier to survive in all these are also the people most likely to have serious problems in the post crisis world because they do not have a computer available to help meet a range of goals computers and prepping can get along a computer cannot hunt a deer for boil or make a pair of obviously on the other any computer with a connection to the can help you find out how to do these things and much more when you find good it is also very easy to store those files on your computer so that you can read them and work with them whenever you want and if you are in a situation where access is still you can use your computer to contact friends and loved ones as well as people that might be able to help you get through a crisis then you can certainly relate to the quandary of many that are finding out it is becoming impossible to make or obtain raw materials that would be needed in a major crisis scenario on the other side of the many of the items you need for basic prepping can still be purchased all you really need is a prepaid debit card and an connection so that you can find websites where you can place your orders not only will you be able to get the supplies you you will also have a much wider selection of other goods to choose from regardless of whether you are interested in the best quality gun cleaning need a certain type of fishing or need good quality vintage hand you can find them all in even if you are you may be able to find customized materials and tools that have been modified to meet your needs most people realize just how important it is to network with from diverse geographic regions and make plans for bugging out that include those friends and connections consider what would happen if an earthquake or hurricane strikes your area if you only have friends and family in a or small chances are everyone will be affected if you have friends in other states that might be able to offer temporary shelter or help you make a new then you will be well ahead of the game in these times and both money and barter systems are vital for exchanging needed goods and services a computer is very important for expanding your trade and marketing options it is also very important for securing alternative currencies that may play a vital role in remaining solvent in the face of currency collapse most people would be truly amazed at how easy it is for the average consumer to secure foreign keep a good supply of and even use them as down and dirty form of currency trading or flipping the tough choice on the best obsolete devices may still be very useful because certain older technologies are easier to work with and may be safer than newer devices that are routinely or are based on unstable hardware platforms if you are interested in newer here are some and models that you can start off with for each category of desktops if you are primarily interested in a conventional desktop my own experience leads me to believe the best option is to build the computer yourself so that you know exactly what parts are being used and how best to optimize the is where you can determine how fast the computer will whether or not the system can boot from a and other aspects of basic settings since modern computer chips tend to run it is very important to provide plenty of ventilation and cooling options inside the case if your and motherboard kit come with heat conducting do not hesitate to find the best on the market it is also very useful to add extra fans and other cooling devices right inside the case always the cooler you can keep the chips during the lower your chances of erratic or even ruining the chips insofar as other vital parts such as hard and video it truly depends on your personal tastes you will need a dedicated video card to gain access to these specialized chips that will reduce wear on the and enhance computer performance at the same time be sure to study gamer forums and video editing forums to find out which video cards work best with specific and motherboard combinations a bad fit between these parts can truly be a disaster memory cards are yet another yet vital area of the computer that you will need to think about this is also one area where only the best will do it is better to go with the fastest cards that the motherboard will and also from the best rated vendor laptops unlike desktop you will have far less control over what parts are found inside the case before purchasing a be sure to find out the model number of the and motherboard from you will need to look up the to find out what the optimal clock speeds are i have seen more than one laptop burn up at around the year mark because a mother board with a slower timing chip was paired with a faster since most buyers do not ask about the motherboard there was no way for them to find out that they basically had an system that was going to fail very quickly i can safely say that i recommend spending times as much money on a laptop when i can choose
escaped the enterprise world and now works as a consultant for when was wrapping up his senior year of he hunted around for a job that would hire an undergrad on flexible hours he knew that the kinds of companies that tended to hire on those terms could often have creative but college about to pay for itself he found a small shop that needed an extra hand extremely there was only one other was prepared to enter a tiny shop with no real practices or because with only one you expect a lot of rules and bureaucracy was only one but he was able to create enough and downright mysterious bureaucratic policies and procedures for fifty developers reading the was closer to reading a but not a good novel where there was a clear point and narrative but something meandering and like a book just opinionated about style he also had opinions on the proper use of source control are absolutely vital for separating units of work explanation came after was stunned by the sheer number of there were hundreds of branches in the repository you have to be intimidated by this we can start you just do this small change in the main then ill show you how to release it dutifully checked out master made the and committed it he sent a pull request you used the wrong branch back out your and put it in the main one which branch is the main its not master it used to but we really use master anymore use master as it turned the main branch was usually whichever branch touched last there were five or six different branches that could be the main branch at any given time maybe it was very hard for to be certain made the changes in master but that was only the start of the nightmare those changes had to be merged into the correct branch for deployment this is pretty do you want me to walk you through asked said and so sat down next to and started explaining each step that needed to perform these explanations started with pressing his fingers against monitor and click fire up the not the this branch the instructional process was recorded as a smear of fingerprints on screen changes merged outward from the main branch main happened to be that instead of merging back towards a trunk of changes were made to the and then percolated according to own twisted logic you he gotta different and some of them depend on a different version of our framework lib this main version builds against version of the framework but your framework up to version like for years but this change only goes out to the so you need to merge from main to master then to then to perky peregrine need to resolve conflicts ground his teeth hard enough to make diamonds between and fought his way through the merge conflicts a few hours one line change was merged into a releasable but had no idea how that change would migrate to any other if it ever did next assignment was to make a change to the same and since it was a larger he made a feature branch off of perky peregrine do the changes then merge right back into perky peregrine after the work was done then he could propagate the changes back to the current main this resulted in an angry visit from are you trying to mess this demanded there is a system there are policies did you even read the development guide i gave feature branches are but they have to come off the main not one of the dependent had tried valiantly to read but failed i was just going to do the merge into perky peregrine and then delete the why does it merge back shrieked delete the branches merge backwards only outwards like a tree each feature branch is supposed to be an entirely new line of development have you even used source something snapped in the back of because for a terrifying that almost made sense had been puzzling over the bizarre state of their source control and those words from put understanding it within tantalizing reach if he asked a few more he might just see the method to this madness chose the wiser path he he he complied with and moved on to the next weeks after cutting through the shrubbery that was branching system the next feature was to make a change that only impacted users of the latest version of the base framework the current main branch was back on version so needed to start by making a branch from there then he had to bring it up to version then convert a few of the into a new then finish the upgrade to this was about two weeks of hair pulling frustration then he could make his changes he spent that week asking serious questions about the career path he was on finally he could merge his changes into the actual release but never back into any master branch this resulted in tens of thousands of merge conflicts the next few weeks were spent cutting through and by the end of that discovered the semester was nearly over he was about to graduate he went to the of the small and handed in his resignation been really impressed by your she said you could stay on after if you like her tone was perhaps even a little but there was a plea in her eyes vaguely recalled hearing that was a friend of the other saw a hint that knew what was doing to their software product maybe she thought could be her ally in fixing it or maybe was reading too much into it discretion was the better part of valor i just think the right fit for this he said they made the polite she promised him a recommendation they

four triangle cases were reported to the mutual network international desk in recent months from new and a witness at recalled an incident from march when he and his wife were sitting in the living room of their apartment at rue la wife sat under a side window of the room from where you can see the rue the witness was already dark outside and there were nearly no cars in that road anymore there is anyway not much traffic in that road it was very silent outside and inside we had no light switched on as we were watching it is impossible that this is any reflection from the inside then i turned around to talk to my wife and i saw a huge triangle with three lights under each witness described the was approximately meters wide and maybe meters high the edges were rounded and there were no windows or anything to see maybe there was something on the but that was not visible from that angle the object was maybe meters or lower from west to following the witness was able to watch the object for between and speed was very but i cannot tell how fast it was it seemed to me like it was searching something like a police but it was sure no helicopter i am a drone pilot myself and i know how a helicopter flies and that it has to make a lot of sound when flying so low surface was black matte without any symbols or markings as far as i have seen witness submitted one illustration with the next week i have searched in for a triangle and it looks nearly exactly like the one described in the wave from but without the red light in the middle my wife asked me what was but before i could answer the object was gone she was making jokes of me so i talk to anybody about that until now but i am nearly sure that someone else must have seen it please let me know if there are other reports so i know i am not international team member closed this case as an new witness at recalled a event from when a about feet long moved overhead on could see the struts quite the witness was the shape of electrical pylons on its side as it passed over there was no noise i could see part of blue light upfront and two light blue lights at the new witness said the triangle had blue lights new witness explained his lived on cashmere hills quite high up after viewing this object for about i asked my wife to get the video camera i filmed it for minutes it somehow turned into a circular light jumping all over the object the moved toward the the craft passed it was a huge triangle shape with light blue discs on the rear and front there was no witness stated that he was later visited by three men in suits and questioned about the images or videos were included with the national director and star team member roger is witness at reported being overcome with fear after watching move to the ground level at on august the witness was at his kitchen table when the lights on the objects caught his witness at reported being overcome with fear after watching move to the ground level formed a the witness was a light at the corner of each of them forming a triangle these triangles that were formed were big the and what had appeared they were doing scared me they were came down to the ground and appeared to be doing something they were there for some witness watched for about stopped watching them and closed the curtains i felt that if i continued to watch that they would sense my presence even perhaps pick up on what i was thinking at first i thought that a couple of took a wrong turn and had to turn around on our property as i kept watching i soon realized i was wrong i was stricken with fear and panic as i had watched what they were doing i tried to calm myself i was so worried that they would sense my presence being so field investigator peter derrick is witness at reported watching a triangle emitting an red light that quickly disappeared about on witness said the low flying triangle shone blue light on the area below is in southwestern was awake studying for my post the witness did what i used to do every night i went out in front of the house and stood right beside the dry river that is just in front of the house that is when it happened i saw a red light in distance it came closer and closer i still get goosebumps when i think about it i move at all i mean i was just like a statue staring at that thing i am usually very brave compared to my friends and but that was the most frightening event of my witness said the object was emitting then started scattering a red light over the area i mean everywhere was red after a it came up and just disappeared in a second i the way it disappeared was even like blinking i have never said this to anyone because i think it will probably sound crazy i know what to who to tell i just found this site and reported what happened i also never went back to that spot for smoking just writing about it here made me feel better already thank international is remember that most sightings can be explained as something natural or the above quotes were edited for clarity please report activity to open minds black man made anti gravity craft is this the new footage of alleged triangle surfaces secret space craft

great source of vitamin c and fiber you can substitute pie pumpkins if you have trouble finding when selecting your choose a wide shape over a round one this will give the top of the custard a better chance to brown while baking you can also skip the pumpkin entirely if just looking for a vegan baked custard recipe if you choose this make sure to bake the custard for only twenty minutes one item to note this recipe makes enough custard to fill a pumpkin with a in circumference if using a smaller you may want to halve this recipe i recommend keeping a small pan ready for any leftover custard just bake it along with your pumpkin for twenty minutes and allow to cool how did pumpkins get to if you thought pumpkin and squash came from the you are absolutely correct traders and explorers originally brought squash and pumpkins from to japan in the century while the empire was expanding into south the squash is simply a variety of the same species that produces the gigantic pumpkins that win ribbons at state fairs i recommend you try to make this recipe with one of those though it could feed an but the cooking time would take their smaller do quite nicely in the squash is called or nutty pumpkin if ever tasted understand the nutty moniker the texture is fluffy and reminiscent of but the flavor is like a butternut squash crossed with a sweet potato squash have a slightly

by on reflections in a petri dish dog poet transmitting its one week until the to be hijacked elections are supposed to take place it stands to reason that at some point in the next seven days a or several are going to go off in the political landscape i do not know what these will be composed of one of them will certainly have to do with the emails but i know what shape it will take i suspect that the trump camp has got some things up its sleeve but they want to wait until no amount of following spin will possess the amount of time necessary to undo the damage i feel pretty confident saying this i have this strong impression that the are sitting on some seriously damaging information got to love the apocalypse in times like these the latest news is that is seeking immunity how real all of this is i know when i read things like has a predilection for underage it makes me scratch my head it like i put anything past these people but sometimes i get the feeling people are reaching and more than willing to believe anything whether it is true or not not saying it what i am saying is i know there is a lot of chatter going on about the emails and sundry suffice to say that we can be certain there is a lot more known by those in a position to know than we are being told i have been feeling a certain uneasiness for two days now no idea what it pertains to but i feel sure something is about to rise to the surface and it is going to be significant there are so many agendas at work and many who are employed by our oppressors and abusers have had it with the satanic behavior of their employers i know what we are looking at but its hour has come round at last we are definitely living in interesting times there are so many ways to look at the state of the world in this period if you are a a an a fear driven or any permutation of similar it is as dickens put the best of times and the worst of times on the surface it certainly has the appearance of being a time for plunder or flight on the one those orchestrating or promoting the chaos are confident that they can steal and murder at under the darkness being generated for that purpose on the other certainly some amount of people are looking for a place to weather the sum of their fears they want some place to hide i know where that might be maybe they do many are already in that bunker mentality with all those guns and certainly the agents of the dark side have got their put together none of these folk have a plan for anything lady nature may come up with for i know that the almighty is screening a movie that was written out of the combined destinies of every life form on the planet this has been going on for such a length of time that no human mind can measure or comprehend the extent of it no human mind can comprehend the extent of one go round of a is it matter what anyone thinks it is all that matters is what it really is and the essence and detail of that has been long known to those so informed of the and woof of the process it was all delineated back in the time of the the nature of existence and the protocol of existence were all mapped out and remain to the present for any inquiring mind to peruse at their leisure of course there are and will be many arguments to the contrary the separated human mind is capable of endless depending of what that separated mind wants to realize out of it it is of no importance to me what others wish to believe all that is important to me is what is true i make no claims to be in possession of this information what i can say is that i have been convinced of the divine architecture of existence and it is only important for me to recognize this and seek to align myself with it experience has proven to me that when i go along with the inner voice and rely on the certitude of the presence of the things go well for me when i rely on my own imperfect awareness of circumstance then i find out what is what and what is not it is never an easy thing to talk about what one only has a partial understanding of it is next to impossible to discuss the ineffable when it exists forever beyond the parameter of words this is the telling argument for faith faith is the substance of things unseen we are here to find ourselves and nothing more surely we can give our time and attention to all manner of pointless exercises and some of them have a long enough shelf life as to seem convincing to many the evidence of the life successes of those who have prospered in the material world stand as examples for the ambitious and those who believe he who dies with the most toys wins this is certainly not true it even be true if there were no invisible hierarchy or worlds beyond this one if you are dead forever then what is the point of the the good and bad news is that this is not a one time life on this earth the of nature is consistent in all of its productions and an unwavering theme of justice and balance runs through the whole

by on visible origami dog poet transmitting i would within the limitations of my to talk a little about yoga which for me is the only legitimate fast track to the divine that exists for the present and the least dangerous of all the options out there my life keeps going by and i step in and out of it these days i spend a great deal of my time in as well as preparation for my ongoing journey it might be awhile yet and it may be right around the either is fine with me i have come to understand that loving the divine is so very much once all the distractions that the greatest majority of us live are in pursuit or which predominates over all of the esoteric alternatives are gone without my even being aware of at nearly all of the usual human attractions and compulsions just slipped out the door and returned i find myself watching life behind some kind of glass its a movie that is being screened in the mind but once the film in the projector has been ordinary life becomes irrelevant and one can immerse themselves in more important considerations one still goes to the supermarket one still eats and excretes one sleeps and awakens in the dream one drives and walks and watches and listens to all of the sounds of the world around them but the effect of all of it has changed last night happens a couple of times a i laid in my bed and did not sleep most of the night so i did as i usually do and i love you over and over and over on this night there was an atmosphere of static and confusion and i could not seem to break through it images of the past spiraled through to haunt me over mistakes made and opportunities missed the voice entered and do not occupy your mind with thoughts of what is past these have all been paid for through your suffering they are not relevant anymore try telling that to the monkey mind the point is that regardless of the static and confusion and the seeming distance between myself and the i did not allow any of these distractions to deter me from the continuous repetition i love you i felt the obstacles that hung in the air i felt all the barriers that occasionally come and go and are sometimes not there at all and i just kept at it i studiously ignored whatever it was that was interfering with my efforts and i told myself that i would not allow anything to no matter how much it did no matter what the difficulty might be i would persevere and i did i fell asleep at some point i awoke this am and good morning lord it is another day and i do not want to forget that every day given to me is an opportunity to celebrate the no matter how far away the almighty might seem to be and no matter how difficult the effort might become the path of love is not an easy cruise to some literal or metaphorical island though we paint it as the only sure and certain route this does not mean it is also an easy route there is bound to be opposition in times of material darkness there are agents of that darkness who seek to hinder and hamper our efforts and these no real efforts are even made the world seems to be swept away in a tidal waves of garbage and noxious dreams that spin themselves out of perverted daylight humanity is there to be found in the midst at all times but it takes a concerted determination to rise and greet it at every turn where it seeks to appear to this is the real work to move through the murk of this existence and reach out to every hungry and troubled heart with some portion of the sunlight we are all given for the purpose of sharing if we are cheap with our the amount of sunlight given will decrease and further decrease until we find ourselves in darkness i refer you to the parable from the where he gave the example of the three men to whom a certain amount of talent were given so it is when you are kept awake in the night and you strive and reach for unity with the ineffable and you get nowhere you continue and continue as at any you will achieve that unity and you will not cease until you even if it is a thousand times a thousand even if you are in prison or confined in even greater distress in the houses of the rich you do not deter you do not immerse yourself in comforting distractions one day the sun will rise in your heart and there will be no further static or confusions the love of god is a consuming fire and fortunate is the one so consumed it is important to understand that such a love will demand everything of you and such a love will try and test you to discover the level of your dedication and many are called but few are chosen i am reminded of that short but powerful poem by the wayfarer the reality of this great and singular quest is precisely as the poem describes and there have been many souls who have discovered the truth of it as they went surging forward in all their temporary and unchallenged right up until they saw that every blade of grass was not a blade of grass imagine in your own life and in your own how often you forget about the ineffable and how often petty and incidental concerns arise in your thoughts to take you away later you can often not remember what these concerns were but you can certainly remember that they were of small since
by on dog poet transmitting its late afternoon and is two days if you count the rest of today or because it would then be and not away anymore then it will take all day for whatever the nonsense is to complete itself and possibly into the next day as well one thing that this election has done and which come to the attention of many people is that it has woken the public up the public has been able to see first hand the level of media bias and the cynically celebrities it has been able to see the intensity of the lies in all those political like the one that said trump was walking in on naked beauty some of whom were only years old that one amused me i have never seen the degree of vituperation that has been taking place i have never seen the media so clearly expose itself for what it is it did it in such a way and to such a degree that even the wet brain public was able to see it apocalypse is like an expensive a multiplicity of gears turning and each gear is a kind of plot construct and it seems impossible to tell which of them are turning all of the others you might term it a wheels within wheels kind of or a number of those acts of misdirection from a great magician all the while a variety of events seem to be taking place but what is happening is that something entirely is being woven out of them all the as the psychopaths and opportunists are having their their every machinations is being recorded for posterity and their every act is being choreographed to a specific end destiny is one of those one of those like karma that has a temporal meaning over a broad surface because of the varieties of interpretations given by this one or that one but these words have much deeper interpretations that according to the depth of the one giving the interpretations destiny has an individual application and then various broader applications families have towns and cities have nations have destinies and even planets have as do solar systems and galaxies the gods have a destiny the gods have karma and all of the aforementioned do as well this accounts for some of those who walked out on their families and the towns and cities they were birthed in and grew up in they were in search of something they carried with them as they went looking it matter where you are no matter where you there you are and the most priceless and valuable thing that it is possible to you are transporting from place to place as you look for it under the guise of everything else the first consideration any human being ought to make in this life is to ponder what it is that is distracting them from self inquiry what is it that makes it so difficult to scrutinize the imponderables of existence how is it that one can see the sun and moon in the sky and the glittering and countless stars and not know that there is some grand and majestic power at work how can one pass by the and gods in the antique shop window and no wonder about the tales that attend how can one not make the connection between the face of a new born baby and an old man sitting in his chair on a how can one attend birthday parties and all those other celebrations and then attend a funeral and not make the connection that since they were present at all of the other how could they not expect that a funeral would be held for there is a story about the brothers where appears as a stork to one of the brothers and asks him what the greatest mystery is the brother know and the stork that you see men dying all around you and do not think that you yourself will die was that in the not remembering it that well but its been decades since i read the major books from the except for the that always seems to be around here somewhere i cannot shake the feeling that some shocking surprises are looming in the event horizon i also cannot get around the feeling of this unshakable optimism that suffuses the atmosphere all around me there are threats of earthquakes and tsunamis there are wars and rumors of wars there is the specter of economic collapse the worst of it is the collective immersion of the human psyche in material culture without this freakish zombie obsession the self styled elite would have no power over the rest of us but it is like pouring swill into a hog trough with the certainty that the hogs will come a running it is a form of pornography even worse than the usual fare its the single most difficult hurdle of them all human ignorance and indifference are what makes all of the visible evil possible and hardly anyone even sees it its business as usual it is the daily redundancy of the dream lumbering up and down the aisles of somewhere in search of something it is the unexamined lives from cradle to grave with nothing understood and nothing to precious lives wasted and in vain few realize the value and privilege of a human birth fewer still realize the potential of it powerful invisible forces wait at the ready for any and every person who begins to show an interest in the hidden side of existence they watch to see who awakens to the joy of service they pray for the opportunity to assist in every righteous endeavor these days more time is spent publicizing a persons acts of alleged charity than the act was worth wealth is relative and so is the value of ones contributions become a cartoon in so many

here something interesting from the review recipient name recipient email as the army advanced further into east fighters responded by firing mortar shells into the district that had been freed earlier in the week we met the families fleeing the mortar barrage crammed into their battered cars and at an army checkpoint at a dozen miles down the road we had been told we could not go any further because it was too dangerous and fighters were firing at the road not far ahead between and we thought we had got rid of and then they started firing mortars at said one woman in black robes she added that a rocket had landed on her house in the morning and killed him and three women she expressed hatred for and said that when soldiers had knocked at her door and asked for information about her small son who looked about had gone to show them the nearest headquarters the people escaping from the eastern side of give a convincing picture of what is happening there as the army moves forward a former metal worker but jobless since captured in said that the shelling had started at and had gone on for an hour he had put his wife and seven children into their car and driven out of the city without much idea of where they were so long as it was safe confirmed reports that were withdrawing from the eastern side of which is separated from the western side by the river they are leaving some two or three fighting positions behind in every district and the fighters there are being he said all the local fighters were leaving and those who stayed behind were foreign members of asked about their said he did not know because he never went near them he pointed to a cigarette packet in his shirt pocket and we cannot talk to the foreigners because as soon as they smell cigarette smoke from they send you off to be whipped there is no doubt that the great majority of people in will be glad to get rid of with its subjugation of women and religious bigotry but it is not at all clear what comes next is likely to lose but it will not go wholly out of business in or anywhere else it is already resorting to guerrilla raids such as one today when a group of fighters took over a mosque and part of the town of miles south of and were resisting they did the same in last month when fighters mysteriously invaded the of the oil city but the effect of the recapture of the second largest city in on the morale and capacity of should be great will no longer have the human and financial resources of the at its peak a powerful administrative to support its campaign of slaughter at home and abroad the very fact of defeat is likely to be damaging for a movement that claimed its victories were divinely inspired another point seldom noticed will make it difficult for to revert to guerrilla warfare of the type that it has waged in the past the secret network of supporters and helpers that once sustained in and in its early no longer exists when became the ruler of the area where it had previously had a hidden its local activists came out of hiding and became the new rulers but with on the retreat and losing its its old guerrilla networks are paying a price for becoming too visible during their day of triumph may be but this does not mean that it is no longer to be feared security may be greater for the minorities living in the the flat land east of city that was once home to half a million people who might be speak their own language and mostly or the security for these people has but only by comparison with what went before when they were persecuted and driven out by the television pictures since the offensive began on are deceptively similar to newsreel of villagers greeting allied armies in in the media is full of talk of the liberation of and the surrounding comments one expert on the area i will not speak about liberation until the displaced and especially the powerless are able to go back to their homes and live in peace and with a credible guarantee of security there were no signs of any such guarantee being given anywhere on the plain today people who wanted to go back to for the first time in two were being held back at army checkpoints and those who were hoping to welcome relatives trapped in for two years were left staring at an empty road there were only a few vehicles with frightened drivers and poles bearing ragged white flags sticking out of the windows not far from there is the empty catholic town of which once had a population of who fled in a local community explains that when they come back they will find that their homes have been destroyed he says that my brothers house was destroyed by an the and my house was damaged burned the other houses before they left and they have all been looted a long time ago even where houses are still there is no water or electricity or likelihood of it being restored any time soon many of the former residents have already migrated to and other parts of the world the

wall street and the pentagon greeted the onset of as a banner a glorious turning point in the quest for malleable regimes willing to the most lucrative economic to sign off on onerous new debt to wall street and to grant use of their strategic military bases to the pentagon and the most powerful and richest countries in south and the most strategic military platform in southeast were the objects of intense us political operations in the to in each wall street and the pentagon secured smashing successes leading to premature ejaculations over the new golden era of financial pillage and unfettered military adventures the early ecstasy has turned to wall street made easy entries and even faster departures once the honeymoon gave way to reality the political procurers persecuted incumbents were soon to have their turn facing prosecution the political who had decreed the sale of were replaced by nationalists who would turn the bordello back into a sovereign nation state this essay outlines the rapid rise and dramatic demise of these erstwhile progeny of wall street and the pentagon in and and then reviews shock and awe as the newly elected president embraced new ties with china while we are no ones and grandiose schemes and outcomes the international financial press was ecstatic over the election of president in and the appointment of former wall street bankers to his cabinet they celebrated the ouster of the evil accusing them of inflating economic reneging on debt obligations and discouraging foreign lenders and investors under the regime all market obstacles were to be removed and all the bankers trembled with anticipation at the good times to come after taking office in president unleashed the animal instincts of the market and the carrion birds flocked in us

appreciation of the peso and a skyrocketing inflation of leading to high interest rates as a the economy fell even deeper in recession exceeding minus for the year while most wall street bankers still retain some faith in the they are not willing to the kind of cash that might allow this increasingly unpopular regime to survive what keep wall street on board the sinking ship are the political and ideological commitments rather than any objective assessment of their dismal economic performance wall street counts on free market bankers appointed to the the massive purge of social services and

by on future now rests in the hands of a man older than the supreme leader of celebrate in the streets of the coastal city of after election of former general as president the news come as much of a surprise in the end presidential posters with face were already being hung around east before the results had even been released but now its has finally elected a new a and former military was elected on making him the ending a political vacuum in the top post that had left now takes the reigns of a country heavily plagued by a massive refugee overload with refugees from various practically public constant threat of war from their southern and bomb attacks from terrorists interestingly this is the second time that has been announced the president to when he and the military government of east appointed itself in and anyone who dared disputed this was met with which did eventually occur even went on to fight a war of liberation against the army forces stationed in during which ended in failure and forced to flee his native land into exile in the man behind the poster is by his to be a strong leader with a military background who knows how to play the political field to achieve his goals on the other most i have spoken to about have offered plenty of negative feedback even from people who i assumed would throw their full support behind the old boy an overall slippery character who has been lucky enough to pick the right partners since his return to after his exile i have to the side of my personality that appreciates dark comedy chuckled at the picture of president sitting in the big chair of the presidential palace with just the slightest whisper of a cheeky smile on his face the last time held the the army under the authority of pictured at the presidential palace in being elected president of president of bombed him out in a attempt to illuminate a stubborn nationalist troublemaker yet years son of offered his personal congratulations to on his election victory just president also shares my dark which would explain his sly smirk while he sat in his prize seat despite all the he has returned to and claimed what he had always the presidency carries with him a considerable amount of political baggage from a long career full of civil war and side switching which has left many in questioning if this lord of war is the man worth appointing to end the political stalemate which some have suggested would be better off remaining politically frozen instead of appointing a man who has fought against the administration in during the late but now fully backs and in this is a totally understandable stance given the lack of honest candidates available in the fact remains that has been left completely disabled by the political deadlock which is pushing the country to the brink i personally agree with the progressive socialist party and leader who said on twitter prior to the vote that its time to elect any president to escape the presidential vacuum why elect i have a growing concern that behind closed doors some very egotistical and conniving millionaires are beginning to see the massive potential gas wealth just sitting off the coast but political class has been far too busy infighting among themselves to invest in steps towards harvesting and selling gas also have their eyes on this untapped wealth lying below the perhaps this could be why so many old adversaries of have decided to suddenly put an end to their refusal to back ally for who is smart enough to see this type of opportunity on the horizon and just about desperate enough to surrender his staunch opposition to candidacy in return for inclusion in any future plans given recent bad luck with his struggling business in i put it past him who is still eagerly perusing the trial and conviction of what he believes where who at news beside former prime minister after announced that he will back to become president assassinated his is now willing to throw his vote to candidate in order to secure the position for the second as prime minister certainly there are many more aspects to consider in what has been a leading up to yesterdays grand finale but i suspect that political godfathers are smart enough to realize they are sitting on a potential trillion dollar money maker is at risk of being high jacked if they continue pussyfooting around over never sectarian feuds what could during my last trip to i was shocked to see how even the average struggle with the lack of basic services the country is a mess and the only institution that is worth any praise is the army that has coped remarkably well under the strains of constant terror attacks from radical terrorists the rise of regional sectarianism and a huge lack of money equipment the proxy of dictator who fought a long bloody war against is now considered the candidate who confirms an political victory over its competitor for political influence in what has largely held the country back is the fact that has been stuck in a vicious game of between refusal to pick a side has left the country empty handed with no vision of a safe future has a desperately needed arms deal with a pathetic blaming the deal cancellation on a statement made by foreign minister happens to be who refused to accept a statement referring to as a terrorist group the produced statement patriarch president of also demanded all league members to condemn which both refused to do in previous attempts to remain has also refused to accept any or offers to provide free arms deliveries to the army in order not to upset the countries ties to the us or the gulf now that holds may have the guts to finally
by on in a few the ugliest and most distasteful presidential election in us history will be and we will see which candidate won to preside over the us as president this is an election that is all about groping and making us the laughing stock of the world as we all saw in this there was little of anything about the priorities that really matter to the people both candidates talk about bringing back industrial and manufacturing jobs we know well that both are liars and will never bring back the kind of industrial and manufacturing jobs that gave a sense of dignity and security the two candidates did their best to cater to the rich and the people with the money and the billionaires who always shaped our nation agenda and politics billions have poured into this year national no different from previous elections where close to billion were injected in and invested in the elections the returns are for the donors never for the voters not only black and but white as well have been neglected for a long time they are getting the shaft everywhere and from especially from that empower corporate to screw the poor at every turn and in every way and congress does that through legislation that gives incentives to corporations to locate their manufacturing jobs that allows banks and financial institutions especially the credit card companies to give the shaft to the poor what does the future hold for our next it should not be surprising that this great country of ours has such a staggering number of poor over million or of the population with the prospect that most will be part of this category at least one if they are between the age of years not all poor are unemployed living off the but there are millions of these poor who are working very hard one or two jobs to make ends with and blacks most likely to be among this category than and with women more likely than men to fall into this category of working and with white males with less than a high school education spending at least one year in this category it is hard to in this country of plentiful that million people earn less than a and million are in deep earning less than a year while our presidential candidates cater to the rich and powerful seeking their no candidates are talking about the jobs that with of available jobs paying less than annually talk about the banks and financial institutions that looted tens of millions from pension funds during the financial crisis of or the fact that congress allowed corporations to benefiting wall street and the while cheating workers out of their pensions and health care of republicans talk about eliminating entitlements for the while forgetting or neglecting the kind of entitlements the us military or the kind of entitlements corporations and rich executives get as part of the deal worked out with members of congress entitlements that are triple what the and poor gets it is true that families out of get cash but not all of them are black or as we are lead to thus causing an outcry to end the welfare system i should note here that of the entitlements goes to the elderly and the poor and retired workers on social security and amounting to billion but then let us look at how the which is sponsored and nurtured by congress screws every day let us for the interest rates charged on credit cards in most the poor are the ones who gets behind on credit card payments and as the interest rates charged is almost twice as much as the average rate and moreover if one gets behind on one payment on one credit all the other credit card companies hike the rate thus the poor pay a higher price and costs with rates charged and the likelihood of default on one then the credit ratings are forcing the poor to pay higher interests on car loans and on mortgage loans what is truly a rip off is the fact that companies like payday loans and car title companies while considered as banks receiving funds at less than can charge borrowers even unconscionable the poor also get the shafts from health care companies especially supplemental insurance because of the fact that the poor are most likely to suffer from certain chronic diseases such as high blood and their rates are much higher than the average add to that the way our schools are funded since we do not have a national tax plan that funds all the funding comes from property tax as such if you are in a poor the income to support the schools the and the fire department is much less than in affluent communities as children get less quality and most likely they will be among the poor who will live on government and most likely these neighborhoods will have higher crime rates and a higher percentage of incarceration what the government saves in support of it pays double that in the cost of crime and incarceration this simply makes no as a society i leave you with two incidents that i personally experienced supplemental health insurance i mean those of us over the age of have and must purchase supplemental health insurance to complement our i purchased a policy from through paying a month after almost a i discovered that the of earned in salary i made a simple and it was shocking to realize that i have to pay years of monthly premium just to pay his salary for one year of i dropped because of this exploitation of disadvantaged communities the other when i had my private which offered auto dealers a smart loyalty where dealers can add to the card special such as oil discount on and extended while consumers benefited from being able to keep track of their
secondary verification by key thoughts thoughts forwarded message at pm thoughts mills i have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and i have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better this is simply a draft but do let me know if this is a helpful process for you all thanks notes for a democratic campaign draft draft draft draft here are some comments and observations based on what we saw in the campaign if we get started we will be in a very strong position to execute well for structure and timing lets assume a total budget of about with more than paid employees and of volunteers the entire startup ceases operation four days after the structure includes a chairman or chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and a president who is the executive in charge of systems and building and managing the organization every day matters as our end date does not change an official campaign right after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best location the campaign headquarters will have about a thousand mostly young and hardworking and enthusiastic its important to have a very large hiring pool as or from which to choose smart and low paid permanent employees is a poor choice as its full of distractions and interruptions moving the location from elsewhere guarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help the key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work for you any outer borough of are all good examples of a blue state city to base in employees will relocate to participate in the and will find low cost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis this worked well in and can work elsewhere the computers will be in the cloud and most likely on amazon web services all the campaign needs are portable tablets and smart phones along with credit card readers the pieces of a campaign the field its important to have strong field with autonomy and empowerment operations talent needs to build the set up the hire the and administer what is about people initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states there is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the human systems the field is about organizing voter and get out the vote programs for organizing build a simple way to link people and activities as a and let the field manage the all cloud based build a simple organizing tool with a functioning avoid deep integration as the benefits are not worth it build on the cloud organizing is really about sharing and linking and this tool would measure and track all of it there are many other crucial early investments needed in the determining the precise list of battleground doing early polling to confirm initial and maintaining and extending voter protection programs at the state level the voter key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them in smart phones will be used to and update profiles on the voter a dynamic volunteer can easily speak with a voter with their email or other digital get the voter videos and other answers to areas they care about benefits of to the scenario includes a volunteer on a walk encountering a potential updating the records real time and deepening contact with the voter and the information we have to offer digital a large group of campaign employees will use digital marketing methods to connect to to offer to use social networks to spread good and to raise money partners like blue state digital will do much of the fund raising a key point is to convert and other partners to pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load media and and polling new tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of earned and social media the impact of press coverage should be measurable in reach and and effectiveness measured by attention and other surveys build tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and and model how it works and who has the biggest impact tools can tell us about the origin of stories and the impact of any person or theme connect polling into this in some way find a way to do polling and not on phones analytics and data science and polling and resource optimization tools for each a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote analytics can model social factors and many other attributes of the needed voters modeling will tell us what who we need to turn out and and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches work well machine intelligence across the data should identify the most important factors for and preference it should be possible to link the voter records in van with upcoming databases from companies like and others for media measurement purposes the analytics tools can be built in house or partnered with a set of vendors core voter database and contact with voters the database of voters is a fine starting point for voter records and is maintained by the vendor needs to be converted to the the code developed for is unlikely to be and replaced by a model where the vendor data is kept in the van database and intermediate databases are arranged with additional information for a voter quite a bit of software is to be developed to match digital identities with the actual voter file with high confidence the key unit of the campaign is a and each and every record is viewable and by volunteers in search of more accurate information in the case where we ca identify the specific we can still have a partial digital voter for a person or
