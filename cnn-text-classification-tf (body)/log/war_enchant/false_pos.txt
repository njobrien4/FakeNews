email it was years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry title of babels collection of short stories written when the and former was with had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones for the backward this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of bread and land it was the assault on the land that for the time being assuaged the peasants responding to an aggrieved the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as with a gray a black and wide red trousers with silver promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the cried lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get its on its last ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like raising from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he you are insulting this my dear answered with fierce conviction pure my dear and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus he stretched his magnificent his trousers girded by cords around the and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a penetrating licked some invisible command from his crimson and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this blossoming romeo her muzzle her legs skidding under feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious the mare slowly and rose onto her legs and then we all saw slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body the mare stood on four legs without moving her lovestruck eyes from so you is a said to the and added and you were my dearest of throwing his reins to his the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap swirling off his operatic disappeared into the headquarters reading this story once again for the first time in i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like and he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse my early connections to modernism and my later connections to that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on th at the cinema village in new directed by who has a background as a sound it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of today as a possible trigger of according to babels multiple identity as communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by who is the grandson of babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work babel was executed for treason in having been charged with belonging to a group and spying for and babels wife who died at the age of in is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering she helped to design the subway system the obit ms recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director m and visits by foreign luminaries like and it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original revolution rather than to fall in line as a toady as he travels around encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in and the stories focus on gangsters living in an hardly the material expect to find written by a partisan of the revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to homo a me or i am and nothing of that which is human is alien to me although i have never read i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort

cubs first baseman stepped up to the microphone during the world series rally in grant park and choked as he spoke about what it meant to be able to be on a team with the catcher who was a mentor to him and center fielder dexter fowler stood singing that silly the one that go cubs go cubs cubs are gonna win today it all really hit home for me as a cubs is full of things that bring us joy but carry unsavory aspects to them the cubs team is owned by tom a man who donated million to trump and bears a frightening resemblance to so much that one might think was his brother the cubs also signed a who served a suspension this year for domestic abuse cubs executives and city officials are responsible for some pretty rapid gentrification in the area of with that almost all of the cubs players had fun with each other and never let the pressures of folklore around curses defeat them that made the truly is where i my fathers name on the wall i had to squeeze it in near the brick live about seven blocks from field i went down there multiple times in the past week the day after they i went down to field to write my fathers name on the stadium wall and join thousands of other cubs fans in paying tribute to who died before they could see the cubs win a world series in the immediate hours after their sweet i took my life into my own hands and went down to the area around and to snap a photo of the stadium sign with world series champions emblazoned on right before game down in the i stood outside the friendly confines and said to to my even though i really believe in this kind of this was going to be the game where they turned it all around that they could still come back i bought a copy of the after each even the editions with the devastating headlines on game and game because it was important to have the full story i can now put those papers and forever see the journey the cubs took and relive the and euphoric moments that took seismic sports the longest championship drought in sports me like so many other it taught once the importance of slowing down life and reveling in these kind of experiences which i know is easy for me to say i did not have a who told me i had to work a night shift or else i would be fired i did not have to worry about what i was going to do to feed my children or prevent my home from being foreclosed i did not have to be concerned about an array of disadvantages people should not have to confront on a daily but all too often we just and lose sight of those little things that can make us feel a bit more content in life or we reject slowing down to appreciate something amazing that magnificently disrupts our during an election that has smothered and shaken many of the perfect antidote was watching this team play baseball players like let their guard down and made themselves vulnerable in front of us they were on a world where they perhaps may have thought they needed to maintain a level of toughness or masculinity on the other as he now famously told during game was an emotional and he did not seem to be ashamed of making that of us were emotional wrecks everyone watching this series felt like emotional wrecks at some point not everyone watched all moments of the unless you happened to be in the select group of people that possibly had tickets to all the never forget how told it was only going to get worse in the inning he was right the tied the game in the acrobatic second baseman had a mishap with a bunt that could have been costly in the and fans had to bow their heads and hope would not make a even though manager clearly overworked him the past few outside field of banks by weather went from great to pouring rain there was a delay that delay gave the team a kind of a bit of a halftime to find their composure to go out and win in the inning was suggested during the rally that this may have been a gift from legendary shortstop and first who was cub legendary third baseman who later became a radio broadcaster the emotional stepped up to the microphone during the rally and gave this very real and human tribute to a grandpa who played his last game on and i sat down a few years ago in an before his last season with he was a free and we just shared we had the same agent were and i say to my this is what the cubs need he is exactly what we need to bring everything together a lot of pieces came through with but he taught myself personally how to become a real winner hes like a brother to back hes taught me a lot in the off the how to be a better person forever grateful for him hes going out a champion forever for the rest of his he can say the last game that he played hes a world to me is what has made these past moments special the fact that it took so very long for the team to finally win a baseball championship means all generations were brought together sons and daughters know their parents longed for and many of them have who longed to see what happened if those parents are still their parents were ecstatic to have lived to see a cubs world shared stories about their first games they games they want to and games they saw with
home to produce documentary exposing corruption within the vaccine industry to produce documentary exposing corruption within the vaccine industry jay may comments superstar dropped a bombshell recently when he revealed that he is working on producing a documentary about the highly controversial topic of vaccines he remained noting that when he talks about something seemingly implying that some power from above could potentially stifle his planned project in an interview with pop site vulture from the film festival on was asked about the controversy surrounding the planned screening of the documentary film from catastrophe to at his film and subsequent decision to not screen the film what i first of there was a big which i see and it was from filmmakers i have yet to find out who it was i wanted to just know who they because to me there was no reason not to see the movie the movie is not hurting anybody it says something it said something to me that was valid maybe some things were but if the movie was percent it was worth seeing and they were saying its because of the filmmaker and he was but how was he by the medical theres a lot going on that i still but it makes me question the whole and the whole vaccine issue is a real one its big money so it did get attention i was happy about that and i talked about another movie called trace amounts that i saw and spoke about it a that people should see and its there something is there with because not tested in some ways the way other medicines and just taken for granted and mandated in some states and people do get sick from it not but certain people are like penicillin when asked whether he would try and screen again if given the said he be interested in doing but hinted that he and the were planning to create a new documentary film potentially focused on the massive financial incentives underpinning the vaccine manufacturing as well as dubious ties between pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies and you always not against against what they put in vaccines that can hurt certain people who are allergic it can kill them sometimes and theres such an industry theres big money in vaccines that the will put working on something else and i are working on doing a but i what to talk much about because when i talk about something happens but thats what we plan to try to do after was pulled from the legend went on the today show to defend his original stance of wanting to screen the noting that there was no reason to pull the film the documentary was allegedly pulled due to threats from other which believed could negatively impact the film festival when today host attempted to point out that there is an overwhelming amount of scientific research that has found no link between vaccines and quickly responded i believe its much more complicated than that there is a link and they are saying there and there are other things there i not a scientist but i know because seen so much reaction of just lets find out the truth went on to explain that he believes there is a potential link between autism and the ingredients in highlighting a documentary called trace amounts the film star pointed out that he but simply wants safe noting that he is the father of an autistic child as a parent of a child who has am concerned and i want to know the truth and not i want safe stated obviously realizes the power residing within the as he pointed out that even talking about this conceptual project could make something happen the vaccine industry has a vested financial interest in not allowing a broad public discussion to be had about vaccines the something happens nebulously refers to would most likely consist of the large financial powers at the root of big leaning on any movie studio bold enough to take on vaccine project similarly to what happened to at jay is a geopolitical free and ardent opponent of authoritarianism he is currently a graduate student at university of pursuing a masters in global affairs jays work has been published on truth in raw as well as many other sites you can follow him on twitter on at sir metropolis and now on share believe it you already know that your beliefs are wrong you act just like the fascist party of no lie and keep lying change some people minds but it is still a lie if referring to think if the industry has nothing to hide than there is no problem but there is a huge problem all lie from the industry you can only suppress the truth of the dangers of vaccines especially for so long before people wake up to the corruption vaccines kill and damage children everyday and thats a vaccines kill more people and children than any diseases another fact there are no facts that vaccines or eradicated any disease have a good wrong i sure hope you ever have a child go regressive autistic after a but i fear that will be the only thing to get you to look as your belief system that blindly trusts the lies of govt agencies
