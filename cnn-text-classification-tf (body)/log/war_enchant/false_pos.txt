email it was years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry title of babels collection of short stories written when the and former was with had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones for the backward this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of bread and land it was the assault on the land that for the time being assuaged the peasants responding to an aggrieved the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as with a gray a black and wide red trousers with silver promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the cried lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get its on its last ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like raising from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he you are insulting this my dear answered with fierce conviction pure my dear and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus he stretched his magnificent his trousers girded by cords around the and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a penetrating licked some invisible command from his crimson and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this blossoming romeo her muzzle her legs skidding under feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious the mare slowly and rose onto her legs and then we all saw slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body the mare stood on four legs without moving her lovestruck eyes from so you is a said to the and added and you were my dearest of throwing his reins to his the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap swirling off his operatic disappeared into the headquarters reading this story once again for the first time in i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like and he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse my early connections to modernism and my later connections to that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on 28 th at the cinema village in new directed by who has a background as a sound it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of today as a possible trigger of according to babels multiple identity as communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by who is the grandson of babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work babel was executed for treason in having been charged with belonging to a group and spying for and babels wife who died at the age of 101 in is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering she helped to design the subway system the obit ms recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director m and visits by foreign luminaries like and it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original revolution rather than to fall in line as a toady as he travels around encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in 1923 and the stories focus on gangsters living in an hardly the material expect to find written by a partisan of the revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to homo a me or i am and nothing of that which is human is alien to me although i have never read i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather probably knew in and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in county in upstate kid twist and other members of murder incorporated only saw the borscht belt as a place where they could dump their victims in swan about fifteen minutes from my home town throughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by that will be a good introduction to babels literary power there are also interviews with some leading babel scholars including professor who spent a day traveling around with to see places where babel lived for a few years before returning to we learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of countless victims by living in he was too attached to culture and language to live abroad while in babel wrote a play titled maria that likely put him on although being a intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start with his theater is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including marina an acclaimed who reads a letter from the titular character in mounted a production of maria at university the plays program describes major character a as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution like the young served in the red cavalry never seen on we only hear from maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five it at dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me by eight i have to be in the political propaganda in charge edit the articles of the divisional i run the literacy classes our reinforcements are all they remind me of the way they talk and act has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries in our house in opposite the hermitage and the winter we might as well have been living in for we knew any thing at all about our it is writing lines like this that got babel killed rather than spying for or babel was a friend and of maxim who remained a despite sharing babels inclination for writing about the lower depths of society he was deeply troubled by how maria depicted political prosecution of the and black within soviet society accused babel of having a predilection for rotting meat apparently had forgotten that was favorite novelist the director of finding babel has a connection to but not to its legendary gangsters he has an ancestor named who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there in an interview given to the review sums up babels relationship to the soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left as someone with roots in the existential outsider world of the that saw as its most eloquent i never found myself comfortable with the milieu that fostered obedience to the genius leader to this it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland i think that description of babels sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the babel represented the insider thats what he was he got himself all the way up to the upper levels of the up to who ended up supervising his torture in the personally i know if he was in the but he had an office in the st monastery where babel was tortured that monastery was being used as a torture the which we note in the we visited it he got himself as close to the flame as possible as an but yet he was an outsider because he was from he was he should not even have been permitted to study under which is where he really honed his skills the only reason that he was able to study under is that he smuggled himself illegally to st when he allowed to be because it was outside the settlement area for so babel was an outsider he then found himself with red calvary with the cossacks in the red running through western as he documented brutality against the and the brutality brought on by both it was a civil war essentially between the reds and the poles who suffered the the and the the peasantry are the ones who suffered the most in that conflict there he was the outsider insider its from this very unique perspective where all his writing came from

home to produce documentary exposing corruption within the vaccine industry to produce documentary exposing corruption within the vaccine industry jay may 2016 78 comments superstar dropped a bombshell recently when he revealed that he is working on producing a documentary about the highly controversial topic of vaccines he remained noting that when he talks about something seemingly implying that some power from above could potentially stifle his planned project in an interview with pop site vulture from the film festival on was asked about the controversy surrounding the planned screening of the documentary film from catastrophe to at his film and subsequent decision to not screen the film what i first of there was a big which i see and it was from filmmakers i have yet to find out who it was i wanted to just know who they because to me there was no reason not to see the movie the movie is not hurting anybody it says something it said something to me that was valid maybe some things were but if the movie was 20 percent it was worth seeing and they were saying its because of the filmmaker and he was but how was he by the medical theres a lot going on that i still but it makes me question the whole and the whole vaccine issue is a real one its big money so it did get attention i was happy about that and i talked about another movie called trace amounts that i saw and spoke about it a that people should see and its there something is there with because not tested in some ways the way other medicines and just taken for granted and mandated in some states and people do get sick from it not but certain people are like penicillin when asked whether he would try and screen again if given the said he be interested in doing but hinted that he and the were planning to create a new documentary film potentially focused on the massive financial incentives underpinning the vaccine manufacturing as well as dubious ties between pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies and you always not against against what they put in vaccines that can hurt certain people who are allergic it can kill them sometimes and theres such an industry theres big money in vaccines that the will put working on something else and i are working on doing a but i what to talk much about because when i talk about something happens but thats what we plan to try to do after was pulled from the legend went on the today show to defend his original stance of wanting to screen the noting that there was no reason to pull the film the documentary was allegedly pulled due to threats from other which believed could negatively impact the film festival when today host attempted to point out that there is an overwhelming amount of scientific research that has found no link between vaccines and quickly responded i believe its much more complicated than that there is a link and they are saying there and there are other things there i not a scientist but i know because seen so much reaction of just lets find out the truth went on to explain that he believes there is a potential link between autism and the ingredients in highlighting a documentary called trace amounts the film star pointed out that he but simply wants safe noting that he is the father of an autistic child as a parent of a child who has am concerned and i want to know the truth and not i want safe stated obviously realizes the power residing within the as he pointed out that even talking about this conceptual project could make something happen the vaccine industry has a vested financial interest in not allowing a broad public discussion to be had about vaccines the something happens nebulously refers to would most likely consist of the large financial powers at the root of big leaning on any movie studio bold enough to take on vaccine project similarly to what happened to at jay is a geopolitical free and ardent opponent of authoritarianism he is currently a graduate student at university of pursuing a masters in global affairs jays work has been published on truth in raw as well as many other sites you can follow him on twitter on at sir metropolis and now on share believe it you already know that your beliefs are wrong you act just like the fascist party of no lie and keep lying change some people minds but it is still a lie if referring to think if the industry has nothing to hide than there is no problem but there is a huge problem all lie from the industry you can only suppress the truth of the dangers of vaccines especially for so long before people wake up to the corruption vaccines kill and damage children everyday and thats a vaccines kill more people and children than any diseases another fact there are no facts that vaccines or eradicated any disease have a good wrong i sure hope you ever have a child go regressive autistic after a but i fear that will be the only thing to get you to look as your belief system that blindly trusts the lies of govt agencies that are bought and bolstered by drug corporations abbey chase please elaborate what does wrong actually and where are you in and there are so many peanut allergies today because in the they were using peanut oil as an those guys are so shes a paid t r o l l read above go easy on these people are paid to and is not their first that is why the posts are weird translation software always good they work out of i n d i a p r o p a g a n d a that mike great i think it is very important that a high profile celebrity is putting his name out there next to an issue such as this i have a 5 month old daughter and when she was given her first round of shots i felt i felt that i had failed her because i have all of the knowledge of what they were injecting her with i have been very skeptical of vaccines for a long time and obviously because of stories such as this i think its very sketchy that there seems to be some new illness floating around every year and the establishment wants us all to run out and get some new vaccine that has been concocted the fact that there is big money involved in pushing these vaccines just takes away more credibility we are finally seeing some of the long term effects of these vaccines as well such as the swine flu vaccines where people who received those shots are having central nervous system problems is obviously invested in this because of his own child and sometimes that is what it takes for these issues to reach the light of day when someone important is personally being they want to speak out i love the site and the stories that the free thought project has to offer and i commend you guys for really touching on the uncomfortable topics that the mainstream ignores i am starting my own the theory and i hope to integrate the same kind of stories i will be happy with a fraction of the success that you guys are abbey chase what happened to your child after the first oh my kid has all his why would bring back diseases and illnesses that our countries seen for maybe pesticides are responsible for autism read that article are you sure your kid is they lose 10 points every shot of or and vaccines never got rid of they cause it here is the chart for whooping cough either worked or but spread at least look what happened when we switched to notice the vaccinated catch carry and over and no symptoms the ones on this chart are only the ones whose vaccine failed and they got symptoms thank simples known since stop and our whooping cough would go back to 400 a and no baby deaths instead they keep using this useless that is spreading whooping cough and killing now has 1 in 25 aged 6 12 with whooping cough cough cough each year fully 5 jabs for just so they can carry and spread it everywhere with no for bloody 6 so what do they do to hide this abysmal failure instead of just banning the vaccine in jab jab babies before in with a vaccine that kills them if given at seriously what did expect would 400 times the baby deaths inside the and if the babies 1 in 50 have sever brain damage called how evil can how fucking corrupt can they protecting a useless and its and trying to cover by killing and maiming more is currently at the second 2003 is currently at the ready to launch all caused by an that is abysmally and during an which is now constant in all the catch carry and spread pertussis so the ones meant to be the newborn are now all infected from vaccinated siblings oh the chart is for pertussis in western lucky got first in the world 1996 2008 the graphs are adjusted for time since introduction of in we had double the number for 2011 now we do n't even bother to report whooping out of my two 60 kids with whooping cough 4 reported and bothered to get tested yes that long lasting cough your kids if it lasts 6 8 yes its whooping cough not serious at the kids here still go to they are allowed to they are xx besides the ones are the ones we know to keep away from newborn it is the that are not coughing that are the draper and yes hes amazing and in perfect health just have to admit you know everything and take my word on it so are you abbey or you trolling skills are at least try and remember which alias you are damn hilarious draper not trolling suck it up i have 2 ids and this site decided it log me in through with the one i originally used i tried several times but it kept catching this one so i said fuck it ill post using this one then then i is notorious for blocking so why did they block your first draper tell you this is the first article of theirs ever commented on and the last worse than for sure i agree is terrible anyway if you are in do you know when they switched completely to the old that worked was called so the important bit is the a meaning instead of whole vaccine it is more of a type i was chatting on line to someone just like you in and he sent me the raw number of whooping cough reports per for last 20 years i told that they introduced in and was spot on the correlation is that clear do you have the yearly for whooping cough in our vaccination rate is in do you know the rates in had an in right near falls hello is you alter another weird you have two different did you just get married in the last 5 minutes or something draper you really wanna change the that all your facts are wrong k goodnight psychopath posting in a few nice to meet you you did explain the other thread why you have multiple i accept that did you know there is no polio in but bill gates has just crippled 40 , 000 by using a live that is proven to spread polio why did he do yes the latest is called z all pregnant women got t mandated vaccines were ready and begun my 2015 women even 20 weeks pregnant in outlying areas got the jab look what happened 20 weeks later out of 5 , 000 sick 5 000 got the jab while still in out of those 5 , 000 sick micro 4 had weird how think people will believe it was a as for they have more sick vaccine damaged babies than they used to have 400 a after pregnancy they now have 25 , 000 a year since 2013 there is no in so what are they trying to blame or are they going to must have had that in but we just for disease the latest paper they put out claiming oh its could have been written by a two year old the real scientists in this at their fraud seems the troll cant remember what alias is weird i write to a abbey yet she forgets which and replies as oh well they only have to have high school work out of and get paid a yeah a draper your an idiot add some information any reason why you believe vaccine is any reason why you believe and contaminated with pesticides food is the only reason for i agree it could be but surely injecting a baby with and all the other besides three different all in one possible could be none of my kids got the different vaccines they are all all my grandkids got the now i have 4 out of 9 autistic grandchildren good on for asking the right questions okay there is a fucking article on the man right up how are you spelling his name wrong you fucking learn more about depleted uranium vaccine and government it join us on everyone is welcome we are military concerned and researchers if its happening in the general i can assure you that it was tested on the first please feel free to add your friends to the group too we the people must hi is difficult for me to post on they keep blocking but thanks for accepting me into the group email seems to be working fine still people are not allowed to be pro because that costs the lots and lots of money here is the graph for whooping cough first to get part vaccine in 1996 look what vaccination rate those vaccinated are the ones catching and spreading it over and over so bad that these vaccinated people are just reinfecting the whole so full of whooping but they get symptoms themselves until around 3 years after last vaccine 5 jabs 5 years so by 6 12 all the vaccinated kids are finally getting the symptoms coughing for 8 just not and then they are protected with real immunity for life the problem is the herd is so damn constantly the vaccinated siblings are the ones infecting the newborn usually their newborn brother or sister there is no lurking coughing person hiding in maternity ward corridors at that is pure no symptoms because of their are spreading it to their little babies know has known this since 2010 all they had to do was stop in about 3 5 yes by no more infecting babies instead decided to vaccinate babies before with a vaccine that kills them if given at that is why babies are so cant be vaccinated as it kills them so what a logical person would assume would happen has happened babies after the jab die in at 400 times the normal unlucky event if they they have a 1 in 50 chance of brain called the mandated in in all pregnant women in the vaccine was produced locally under from and they began jabbing pregnant women from 20 weeks gestation in may 20 weeks later look what 5 , 000 of 5 , 000 deformed had given in and 4 had now it is believed they got the as they were already brain damaged in yet for some reason for disease and seem unable to see this and totally obvious and have spent millions trying to prove a done it the only problem with the is that of pregnant women began in 2013 in and went from 400 a to 25 , 000 yes twenty five thousand a year but apparently missed see comments tried said not allowed to tried again a different seems to have hope its good that is taking this stance he still could have used his influence in keeping in the film festival he caved in to industry pressure and took a lot of heat for it it is good that he has clarified his position on vaccines i would like to tell that if the manufacturers could remove the harmful ingredients to make what he calls a safe he think they would have done it and end the the fact is that which are harmful to are needed in the vaccines so they do not spoil what would be a better topic to discuss is the entire premise of the vaccine theory which met a lot of opposition when it was first stated by and still is questioned to this very day tom are you sure about only todays west authoritatively states that all vaccines are and babies immune systems can cope with thousands of vaccinations and is one of the safest vaccines ever produced mind you they also said were safe and quoted two scientific studies funded by to back up their statement they also said are good for our economy and we will all that was all no quotes or sources to back that up wonder if the west newspaper is trying to do a head job on well they been trying hard to get me from more corrupt than even god help draper maybe you talk to much your kinda this comment section i especially like the zero deaths from measles did you read the pediatric site i especially love how there were 2 6 million in 1980 and vaccines have decreased this by so now only a outlet hundred thousand people die from it hello nice to meet you am i not allowed to have an even though i am a in and also a chemical and yeah i know my stuff i read that is all been damn trolled out by so much it is now just pure rubbish why should i talk about measles in the i live in we have decent sewerage decent and hygienic living conditions where do you live that you have had measles draper i live in and you are
