the first part of unabashedly movie about a remarkable has some of the wondrous feeling of a fairy tale the audience is invited to imagine a time to be precise before social media or or in those a person could get which is just what happens to a little boy named who accidentally travels more than 1 , 000 miles from his home in central to the streets of mother is a laborer in a poor village he and his beloved older supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find in the first they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market follows to a railroad where the younger boy accidentally boards an train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language with minimal and graceful and the screenwriter convey the dimensions of situation he is small and but also smart and and even as he is exposed to horrifying he is also a hero on an adventure the enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery you fear for and also root for and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling what happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated played by has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an john and sue and he has a who was also adopted from and has mental health and problems despite seems to be living in the stage of the fairy tale he moves to to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow from but memories of his life haunt and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home using sets out to on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom his accidental journey not a fast or easy and the effort takes an emotional toll on on his parents and on but you even if not familiar with the true story behind that the fairy tale will come true with strong assistance from a cast of charismatic criers and the music of and floods the viewer with big feelings if you have ever been a raised a lost a child or met a child or a mother this movie will wreck you as a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin i it is manipulative and but in a way that seems fair and transparent it quite satisfying the transition from the young to the demands a shift in tone and genre that quite achieve what felt in the first part like simplicity in the latter like simplification there enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older a full identity the movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back at the the focus shifts from the agonies of to the glories of i complain too much about for all i brought you to this review but i also help feeling a chill amid all the warm a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable it is indeed remarkable how small the world has how many problems data can how connected we all are to one another but lost and we even see what it is

in his early years as a m was once asked about the most effective way to fight organized crime at the had made a name for himself as a united states attorney by indicting more than 100 mafia figures raised a novel strategy we ought to declare a moratorium on the prosecution of organized crime for five to 10 he told victor s for a new times magazine article in 1970 let them become so rich that they will give up their predatory instincts and be much more concerned about getting their children into law medical school and so and have lost their he never did declare that moratorium his years of doing battle with crime in all forms were just beginning now 97 and still working five days a was the district attorney for from 1975 until he retired at age 90 in during which time crime in new was completely and the city with it there were 648 murders in the year he took office when he there were 58 it was the kind of transformation no one at the time could have imagined robberies and property crimes similarly fell sharply parks and whole neighborhoods were reinvented people who were dedicated to killing one another found other ways to settle their disputes on a recent lunch hour in his office at the firm was at a loss to explain just how it had all happened theory was prompt and certain prosecution and he said you commit a the chances of you being arrested were pretty good and be prosecuted promptly i believe in long sentences crime came down all but it came down much more in than any other place in the city or state we went from being the no 1 borough for murders to no 4 i never claimed credit for the drop in because i thought if crime goes back up they can blame me so i never stuck my neck his office in midtown where he has worked since faintly echoed the clutter of his former with stacks of papers covering the desk and and no computer in sight the lunch was sandwiches and salads he recalled a night from his first months on the when he sat in a surveillance van on the lower east side of and watched dealers sell drugs as a uniformed patrolman stood idly by were getting away with he said the police department really looking at any murders north of 96th street that was where it was walled off a severed head was found on avenue in the nobody was investigating to see who it was or what happened it news it the numbers from his tenure are staggering a oversaw by his count 3 5 million and he won nine elections and served under five he hired assistant district m john f r more than 80 of his prosecutors went on to be judges better or said he brought cases against international drug money the murderer of john the chambers and the son who swindled millions from he was in a cardigan with a gruff mouth and sometimes mismatched socks his prosecutors won hundreds of millions in settlements and judgments against including l the former chief executive of international whose luxuries included a shower they also wrongfully prosecuted five young and men for the rape and beating of a jogger in central park was remarkably said president of john jay college of criminal who was also a mayoral adviser and deputy commissioner of legal matters for the police department during parts of tenure had a reputation for making tough calls and putting his name and reputation on the in most elections he ran uncontested became the model for the first district attorney on played by who the real district attorney thought was pretty good was mad at said he came down to see and i had lunch with him and i told if you ever decide to let me know in advance the report was he was getting an episode i was he resigned without telling when in left he told reporters he did not know what he would do but he was not ready to hang it up got an email from my older brother who said this is a bad time to be looking for a he said morris was born in into a family that rose to great public influence through public service his grandfather henry was president ambassador to where he unsuccessfully urged the united states to intervene in the slaughter of his henry was treasury secretary under his friend president franklin d and persuaded the reluctant administration to intercede belatedly in the slaughter of the second of three grew up on the upper west side of and in upstate new among the and the used to cook for he volunteering a story he has told before have some pictures of me cooking hot dogs for the queen but the most exciting thing for me was when brought down to our farm in my my came into navy yard and i got a weekend pass and i came home i made them mint his father and the president planned to open a restaurant together if political career went said for some reason has never got any he said was going to be the and my father was going to be the chief chef they actually bought the for the young his public service career began with world war where he served on a destroyer that was sunk by torpedo then on another that spent almost two months under constant aerial attack those more than his relationship with the shaped his said who is writing a family biography of the the future district attorney spent much of the and coping with undiagnosed until president john f tapped him to be a united states attorney in 1961 in his midtown said only that his brushes with death in the war drove him to something useful with the rest of my as a united states built a reputation first for taking on the mafia and and later for not leaving the job when a republican m took office and wanted him gone instead he pursuing cases that involved campaign donors and telling reporters that if the president had asked him to stay he would have resigned immediately when he took over the district there were fewer than 300 many without desk and crime was beginning a historic climb he directed his resources toward violent which dominated the public mind he reorganized the department so the same prosecutor took on a case from arraignment to cutting the time for felony cases to 18 weeks from 32 weeks he started a career criminal program to go after the repeat offenders who commit a disproportionate share of and added the first sex crimes a unit for gun crimes and a branch office in then a hotbed of crime buzzwords that occur to me are ethics and said m president of the citizens crime commission and a former prosecutor under from day 1 you understood that there were and you cross them and independence he was willing to yield power he never overruled anything i if there were mistakes along the like the wrongful 1990 prosecution of five young men on charges of raping and brutalizing a jogger in central now had little interest in revisiting them a matter of policy i look he said i wish done though there were some things i should have done but i mean i think i did everything i just try to close that of the central park which were vacated after 12 years when a serial rapist followed by an eventual settlement of million to the five would say only that his office had erred but corrected the mistake when the new evidence emerged i feel he said i felt badly we had screwed up but there were confessions had complete confidence in he referring to the prosecutor who supervised the case out to be misplaced but we rectified ms who now writes crime novels and conducts training sessions with the district has defended the prosecution and investigation as sound culpa does not satisfy critics like l a defense lawyer who often went up against his including in the appeal of one of the central park five tenure almost precisely tracked the era of mass said was the dean and he could have used his moral authority to change that and he was silent he was an active contributor to mass said that on the he avoided seeking long sentences for offenders and that he instructed his staff not to prosecute people arrested on marijuana charges but he defended the strategy of prosecuting offenders like because killers or rapists tended to commit lesser crimes as well and as violent crime fell in the late with the end of the crack cocaine shifted the resources to securities and other often entering turf battles with federal prosecutors in his last five his office recovered more than billion from settlements and forfeitures though he was accused of losing focus on neighborhood he had pursued those difficult cases a kid on the street can stick up a but he put his money he all these people driving around in fancy and you had to show them that justice was for his successes earned him enemies and occasional threats was pretty fatalistic about he said worry about the professional because i figured they knew what they were doing and been through the system what i worried about was the said he got the most threatening letters when his office prosecuted the new giants wide receiver who in 2008 accidentally shot himself at a and later pleaded guilty to gun charges he the risk they were in his current has been lobbying to ease immigration laws and improve mental health care for military and helping the death penalty appeal in of who was convicted in 1988 on testimony from witnesses who later proved unreliable still reports to work god he said he gets on the treadmill most days and wears a heart monitor the stacks of paper in the office rise familiarly around his van has been with him since he became district attorney when his cellphone rang during the lunch the voice on the other end was loud enough to carry across the table his a former reporter for the new times and the author of and answering the call just calling to say i love the voice blared he told her appreciate as codas to a highly effectual public his current projects seem almost especially his push for looser immigration which is unlikely to succeed in a trump administration standpoint payback he referring to the good fortune his family has starting with his immigrant grandfather like what and i think what doing is important i may be kidding he admitted that none of his projects were going well and like everyone else in new he is trying to make sense of a changing one in whose changes he played a part the streets are but monstrosities have gone and the prices are out of with money flaunt it the way they do he continued just think the huge no communication between them and the street no sense of community you feel it i think he remembered his childhood at 35 west 81st sandwiched between the avenue elevated train and the eighth avenue streetcar pride ourselves on how modern we but we had better local transportation than we do he said fact that there was an el there kept the property values down but as a child it was an attraction you wake up at 2 in the morning and hear a train rumbling by and you felt secure in an odd it was as close as he came to pining for a bygone and as quickly as the sentiment rose it was gone again after more than half a century as a knows you lose some then gather yourself to fight another day because if you that would be the time to start worrying and unlike his he simply go into reruns not anyway

thoughts about the new episodes of over there which means that people need to be able to come and go from the area and still follow which is why any show will fit the bill but above you seek great baking this is the most earnest and enjoyable of any show in living and the skills and passion on display are significant and inspiring something else with always chefs compete in ridiculous and each episode stands no unifying narrative this is an nothing nothing violent beyond aggressive dessert nothing sexual something with football not actual cowboys making the covers the selection process to the most grueling and underpaid position in professional football unlike with other its format so no regular elimination and the show constantly telegraphing going to be cut this is better for teens and and might provide a good opportunity to talk about healthy body images something farther afield is for and it is riveting even no boring and no malicious behavior all of the contestants work hard and are kind to one regularly helping their competitors and praising one work once in a while there are but those are easy to skip if watching with anyone over 12 or so will be completely fine this is still not the time to finally watch or anything too people someone gets up to stir something you want to be shushing people or asking everyone to pause stuff while you check on the pies time for solid shows that still require tremendous brainpower go with drama answer to from 2005 season 1 is a solid action although the show grows exhausting after that something with is a but fizzy and fun comedy based on memoir it stars john john and frank plus other familiar faces star is among the so if you like shows like and the and give this a whirl it aired on so not too but it does spend a lot of time talking about talking sex something with football not actual the riveting documentary series chance is one of my favorite shows of the and there is no one on earth who cares less about football than i do if you like night and for this about a community college football team known for sending players to division 1 programs and then to the is a must something farther afield of the is about competitive drum corps and focuses on two teams vying for top honors color guard very sweaty you will have to go to to find the full since each about 14 minutes long worth this is the time to tackle whatever prestige show been putting off perhaps also always winter on that so something psychically correct about starting it in late something with if looking for upbeat but still like an comedy about a young gay man and his quirky is a charmer each episode title is the name of a food that is cooked or consumed during the episode something with football not actual if you watched night holy lord in do so now if bummed and want to steer into the has plenty of weeping if bummed and want to cheer has hope and determination if you feel great and want to feel even turn to there is no bad time to watch night and there is no better time to watch it than when you have a few days to yourself and can just go to on it something farther if you like bleak ensemble try a import set on a fictional

is childhood the golden era of and can you get those relationships the other i took down from the shelf a beautiful novel by maxwell see you and i realized the title alone summons the unspoken the constant the relentless promise that friendship is when you are 12 my great friend at that age was mark in those days on west mark was my constant companion and my secret whatever happened at there would always be mark to brighten the day and spit with style like river phoenix did in by via a tongue we would be up at the crack of dawn to wander over the scan the beaches for climb the hills together and sit in the graveyard comparing our plans for world domination mark had he was often in and write to each other planning our adventures for the summer he told me i was a good writer and i told him he was a great before we disappeared from each lives i seen him in 30 years when i recently tried to find mark he appear to exist like the boys in he seemed like a or a fragile piece of memory that crumbles when you turn it in your hands he to be found at the old address i had for him in the seaside town of his name is a popular one on but none of the marks i found was the one i and he on twitter or either none of the search engines reveal anything about mark i tried death as i have for a long that my old friend might have died i asked my mother if any of her friends had kept in touch with the family but none had i could remember two of his names but they show up on the either when i went back to i drove to the square where we once and i looked up at the window of my old remembering how i used to shine a torch from there to bedroom two flashes meant good night three flashes meant see you tomorrow i wonder if technology has changed the meaning of friendship my daughter is 12 and most things that happen to her are photographed she and her friends get together and spend hours trying out making retouching setting them to music and posting them on this or that social media network sure the girls are bonded in many of the traditional but i also wonder if ever lose sight of each which was always one of the possibilities of an aspect of its mystery i think we always knew we would move on in life and that our great friendships would be a matter of memory i have a single photograph of mark i think we were ever photographed and that adds to the notion that our friendship was a fiction social media is a vehicle of a means of fixing an idea of yourself in the social without people actually knowing you at all and a the thing about friendship used to be that the ideal was shared entirely by the pair of or sometimes by a yet it remained and that was part of its power the mindfulness i miss a pair of excellent youngsters in my wider family have over 1 , 000 between them they say they know half of and that some of them are the social network gives them the option of corralling people into or they always have the option of clicking but are the majority of these people friends or are they just you can know everything going on in lives without knowing a single thing going on in their hearts but is that told that empathy still flowers in the usual but i have my doubts people now in their have a lot of but are i close to the point where a bad or a death in the a moment of opportunity for the protective and dignifying balms of old but simply a quiet day on social the times we live in are big on loyalty technology has driven us wild with questions of loyalty to to to a of or to brands who give out to those who stay tight but the only kind of loyalty that matters is to know your friends and stick with them the relationship has nothing really to do with outside or with your or with status and perhaps our vision of friendship has been degraded by the relentless nature of our communications technology replace and with and close the curtains and mix two download but lose yourself in the sort of communication that has nothing to sell love gets all the big but friendship is where the action especially if you consider that it is really a lack of friendship that makes an unhappy marriage the art of friendship that warms you in the various winters of your and when in trouble you want 1 , 000 but just one is the hardest thing in the world to the late is thought to have said not something you learn in school but if you learned the meaning of you really learned and that is why i miss my old friend mark there was something there that stood outside of achievement or money or religion or reputation as i i was never photographed with mark and i never hugged him or bought him lunch either but sometimes in a dark hour look up and imagine i see not far a living guarantee that there will always be someone in life who really knows who you are when all the machines are off and when all the chips are i see his light three flashes

if you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and j various you be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas but this the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson i categorized the campaign news coverage of 23 media outlets this consisted of four broadcast three cable news national public radio and on the two news and 12 newspapers i specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like trump the khan family and the i also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy the controversies received more on than their views on the economy from until election 38 percent of the stories mentioned various and 35 percent mentioned email only 17 percent mentioned trump and jobs or the and only 10 percent cited campaign and the economy closer to the from 8 the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before director b letter to congress from this 53 percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only 6 percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for 31 percent mention his while 10 percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video between 15 and election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed trump and his imbroglios a mere 7 percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned trump and the these choices have consequences according to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in mentions of trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the i used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did all over half a million ads were run in 2016 during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character in the losing ads did little else more than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions only 9 percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by 34 percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made 76 percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on traits typically garner about 22 percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about 28 percent of the appeals usually much more balance of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as and the news media covered it

it happened so one moment i was running the next i was staring a sow in the so close i could smell wild and pungent and and i knew it could smell my fear i was in the middle of a rainy run in far north bicentennial park on the outskirts of where i live it was late a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the salmon swimming up creek but i was miles from the water i had planned my route away from the and i seen bear scat in more than an hour as i crested a a crash sounded from my and i instinctively moved to the expecting a moose but it was the sow with three cubs the cubs fled up a tree the sow paused in front of as if waiting i backed into the fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder moving never taking my eyes off the bear when it veered as if to leave i felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me impossible to run the trails around without thinking about bears there are piles of scat dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the reminders that you have to be careful you have to be versed in bear bear etiquette and bear protocol headphones are a and going alone is discouraged making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended i often ran alone i preferred it that way i liked the serenity and the liked the hours of nothing but me and the mountains and the trees that i wore a bear bell attached to my hydration and i whenever i came to dense areas i sang old rock roll loudly and badly i was cautious but not afraid i ran these trails all summer and the summer and while i saw bears on many other i only twice saw them on these sections maybe i let down my guard maybe i felt the way you feel when you repeat risky behavior without negative results maybe the bear was having a bad day when the bear time stood still i felt every millisecond i stood in the rain coating my face like and i did what they tell you to do if a black bear i waved my arms and yelled i my voice rising through the birch through that silent and moment a the bear paused and ran back toward the brush a minute it charged a second time and again i waved my arms and yelled and again it this time so close i could almost reach out and touch its snout i swallow i briefly and almost if this was how i would die i wanted to talk to my who was grown and off living his own life i wanted to hear his voice a lifetime the bear turned and ran its backside swaying into the trees i had to get back to the to the possibility of yet i step away from the alders it was my only protection when the bear began circling around me in a wide arc when i knew i was in became really afraid when my son was young and nothing would comfort i would talk it matter what i he needed my the steady flow of words as i stepped from the shelter of the i talked out my voice surprisingly calm i talked to the bear to show that i meant no but mostly i talked to reassure myself as the bear circled for a second i stumbled through snagging my shorts and scratching my and i talked about the day my son was how i recognized his face immediately when i reached the i kept talking the bear but i look back a half a mile i glanced over my and the bear was gone i started running and stop until i encountered two and i collapsed at their feet for weeks i saw that face in my and i woke heart pounding i swore i would never run trails but i missed it too and soon i was out with the trees and that big sky some things are worth the though i made sure to carry a canister of bear just in case and sometimes even now when i think of that bear charging and how i stood so still and yet so alive it opened something inside of me that can never be closed it offered a taste of the at any time i might find myself crouched in the face to face with my own fragile existence so much of life is chance there are no guarantees but there are vast landscapes and dangers and wild moments of good luck
after years of tough spending government on cast aside the language of austerity as it acknowledged the high economic cost of withdrawal from the and tried to placate struggling families whose incomes have stagnated a pledge by the previous chancellor of the or finance to balance the budget by 2020 has been shelved the current is replacing it with a vaguer ambition to do so as soon as practical after 2020 help for workers whose low earnings are supplemented by welfare an increase in the minimum wage and new infrastructure spending were features of the first autumn or spending from who became chancellor in changes were centered on a section of society identified by prime minister may as those about also referred to as who are thought to have voted in large numbers for withdrawal from the or in the 23 referendum laid out plans to finance construction of 40 , 000 new affordable homes and to provide more help with child though there was also a less welcome increase in the tax on insurance premiums and there is a bigger catch for the as for the specter of withdrawal from the union hovers over the economy the uncertainties complicate life for and threaten to hit living standards just as they were beginning to improve for some while has not had the immediate negative effects some economists announced lower growth projections and higher borrowing estimates and inflation forecasts task now is to prepare our economy to be resilient as we exit the told lawmakers one of the and most is nicknamed spreadsheet because of his reputation for approaching politics more as an accountant than a visionary he was moved from his post as foreign secretary to become chancellor shortly after the referendum like had argued against withdrawal that has made him a target of ideological opponents on the right of the governing conservative who want to speed fearing that their goal of a clean break with the union will be betrayed after warned in television interviews of a rocky outlook and an economy with an large supporters of the withdrawal accused him of negativity on official forecasts suggested that he was correct and that the debt would rise to more than 90 percent of gross domestic product in 2017 18 from 84 2 percent last year despite the positive economic signs so forecasts from the independent office for budget responsibility underscored the high price is likely to pay for over the next five years during that potential growth will be 2 4 percentage points lower than would have been the said over the forecasting around billion of a total of billion in additional borrowing can be attributed to driven by the steep fall in the value of the inflation is coming back expect the fall to add almost 2 percent to the level of consumer prices over the next two said the office for budget adding that earnings growth will consequently fall close to zero next it added over government has opted neither for a large fiscal stimulus nor for more austerity over the medium may plans to invoke withdrawal which are scheduled to last two before the end of but uncertainty over the future trading environment seems to be chilling inward investment and reducing tax collection businesses have been jittery since the and there was alarm at suggestions in that she prioritized regaining control of immigration policy over maintaining unfettered access to the single market so comments suggested to many that she was aligning herself with those in favor of a clean break on may sought to reassure businesses fearing a sudden change in rules once leaves the union she also retreated on suggestions that businesses would be forced to place worker representatives on company boards faces some longstanding economic difficulties according to a research note from three economists at bank of those include productivity the already probably undeliverable austerity that is planned in government spending and the large deterioration in the finances that will result if the government delivers on its plan to reduce migration to the tens of over they higher lower government spending or permanently higher while much of address had been telegraphed in previous he did throw one his first autumn he would also be his last starting next he will move annual budget statement from the spring to the so that taxation changes can be announced well before the start of the tax in there will be an annual spring statement responding to economic but no regular fiscal he said
publisher of the new thank you very much for joining us and i want to reaffirm this is on the record j of the united all so clear we had a very nice meeting in the room a i i i am a photo of the great man behind you there was a big thing about the bust that was removed out of the oval office i heard thinking of putting it back i indeed i am wonderful so got a good collection here from our newsroom and editorial and our columnists i just want to say we had a but useful and conversation in there so i appreciate that very much i appreciate too i thought maybe start this off by asking if you have anything you would like to start this off with before we move to the easiest questions going to get this administration i just appreciate the meeting and i have great respect for the new times tremendous respect very special always has been very special i think been treated very rough well out there that been treated extremely unfairly in a in a true sense i only complain about the times i would say the times was about the roughest of all you could make the case the post was but every once in a while actually get a good article not but every once in awhile i have great respect for the and like to turn it around i think it would make the job i am doing much easier working very hard we have great people coming in i think be very impressed with the names be announcing some very shortly everybody wanted to do this people are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks but giving up a lot i mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is but i think going to see some tremendous tremendous talent coming in we have many people for every job i mean no matter what the job we have many incredible people i you can sort of just confirm that the quality of the people is very good choice for chief of trying very hard to get the best people not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct because that been working so we have really experts in the field some are known and some are not but known within their field as being the best very important to me you been given a great honor been very tough been 18 months of brutality in a true but we won it we won it pretty big the final numbers are coming out or i guess coming out just being confirmed but the numbers are coming out far beyond what wildest expectation was i know if it was i we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people as you probably i did many speeches that last period i was just telling that i went around and did speeches in the pretty much 11 different that the massive crowds we were getting if we had a stadium that held and most of many of you were there that held 20 , 000 have 15 , 000 people outside that get in so we came up with a good system we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left i would during the last two or three a day a lot because not easy when you have big crowds those not an easy way of doing three a day then i said the last two i want to do six and seven and not sure anybody has ever done that but we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 in the morning in and we had 31 , 000 17 , 000 or 18 , 000 inside and the rest outside this massive place in grand i guess and it was an incredible thing and i left do we lose i think we can lose and the reason i did it was set up only a little while before because we heard that day that was hearing that going to lose which been lost in 38 years or something but 38 years and they want to lose so they went out along with president and bill and they went to late sort of late afternoon and i go to it on the schedule so i finished up in new and at 10 i went to we got there at 12 we started speaking around and we had 31 , 000 people and i i there are things happening but we saw it everywhere so we felt very good we had great numbers and we thought going to win we thought we were going to win we thought we were going to win north we did pretty easily we thought strongly we were going to win the problem is nobody had won it and it was as you the great state that always got away every republican thought they were going to win for 38 years and they just win it and i thought we were going to win it and we won we won you relatively we won it by a number of points we won by 180 , 000 was that the more than 180 , 000 and votes are still coming in from the which we are getting about 85 percent of so we won that by a lot of votes you we had a great victory we had a great victory i think it would have been easier because i see every once in awhile somebody the popular the popular vote would have been a lot but a whole different campaign i would have been in i would have been in and new and we have gone anywhere else which i mean rather do the popular vote from the standpoint think do actually as well or better a whole different campaign if a like match play versus stroke play a whole different game but i think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because go to a few places i think the genius of the electoral college i was never a fan of the electoral college until now until now until now i guess now i like it for two reasons what it does do is it gets you out to see states that never see otherwise very interesting like i went to four times i went to 2 for because everybody was saying you can get to 269 but there is no path to 270 we learned that was false because we ended up with got to got to get in but there is no path to you have to get the one in so we kept going back to and we did get the one in we kept going to and we went to a lot of states that you spend a lot of time in and it does get you we actually went to about 22 whereas if going for popular probably go to or it could be three you leave new stay in new and stay in so a certain genius about it and i like it either way but sort of interesting but we had an amazing period of time i got to know the we have a great a great and the enthusiasm was really incredible the times had a poll which was interesting because i was always up in that poll they had something that i a technique in it was called enthusiasm they added an enthusiasm factor and my people had great and people have enthusiasm and in the end she get the vote and we ended up close to 15 as you know we started off at we ended up with almost 15 and more a lot of people show because the community liked me they liked what i was saying so they necessarily vote for but they show which was a big problem that she had i ended up doing very well with which was which i never understood why i was doing because go to the rallies and have so many women holding up for but i kept reading polls saying that not doing well with women i think whoever is doing it here would say that we did very well with especially certain women dean executive editor of the new as you describe you did do something really remarkable you energized a lot of people in the country who really wanted change in but along with that and this is going to create a tricky thing for you you also energized presumably a smaller number of people who were evidenced at the convention in this weekend who have a very i just saw that today love to hear you talk about how going to manage that group of people who actually may not be the larger group but who have an expectation for you and are angry about the country and its along racial lines my first question do you feel like you said things that energized them in and how are you going to manage i think dean first of i want to energize the group not looking to energize them i want to energize the and i disavow the group i know if reporting or whatever i know where they were four years and where they were for and and all of the other people that so i just i had nothing to compare it to but not a group i want to and if they are energized i want to look into it and find out why what we do want to do is we want to bring the country because the country is very and one thing i did big league very and going to work very hard to bring the country together i somebody that really has gotten along with people over the years it was my i went to a big event about two years ago just after i started thinking about politics and walking in and some people were cheering and some people were and she you have never booed for never had a person boo and all of a sudden people are booing me she never happened before politics you all of a sudden they think going to be running for and a say so something that i had never experienced before and i people are and she never booed before but now they boo you it was a group and another group was going the opposite i want to bring the country together very important to me in a very divided country in many ways divided so going to do that thing that executive editors get to do which is to invite reporters to jump in and ask questions political thank dean like to thank you for being here this talked about not prosecuting we were hoping you could talk about exactly what that means does that mean just the or the emails and the and how you came to that decision there was a report that somebody said that not enthused about it i want to move i want to move back and i want to hurt the i really she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many different ways and i am not looking to hurt them at all the campaign was vicious they say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign i added it was definitely the most i assume you sold a lot of newspapers i would imagine i would imagine just telling not looking to hurt them i think been through a lot gone through a lot really looking i think we have to get the focus of the country into looking forward if i could we had a good conversation you and and it was off the but there was nothing just wanted to make sure the idea of looking forward was one of the themes that you were saying that we need to now get past the deputy managing so definitively taking that off the the but the question was asked about the emails and the but just not something that i feel very strongly about i feel very strongly about health care i feel very strongly about an immigration bill that i think even the people in this room can be happy you been talking about immigration bills for 50 years and ever happened i feel very strongly about an immigration bill fair and just and a lot of other things there are a lot of things i feel strongly about not looking to look back and go through this this was a very painful period this was a very painful election with all of the email things and all of the foundation things and all of the everything that they went through and the whole country went through this was a very painful period of time i read recently where it it they used to say it was against whoever and none of us were there to see it and there a lot of recordings of but the fact is that there were some pretty vicious they say this this was the most they say it was definitely the most vicious primary and i think very important to look forward senior editor for do you think it would disappoint your supporters who seemed very animated by the idea of accountability in the what would you say to i think they will be disappointed i think i will explain that we have in many ways save our country because our really in big trouble we have a lot of trouble a lot of problems and one of the big i talk divisiveness i think that a lot of people will appreciate not doing it for that reason doing it because time to go in a different direction there was a lot of and i think that the people that supported me with such where they will show up at 1 in the morning to hear a speech it was actually election they showed up so that was essentially election day i think understand very completely l opinion can i ask a one of the issues that you actually were very careful not to speak about during the and spoken about is one very near and dear to my the whole issue of climate the how approach it you own some of the most beautiful links golf courses in the world cross i read your article some will be even better because actually like is a little bit off so be perfect he say that he just says that the ones that are near the water will be but will be in great shape but really important to and i think to a lot of our to know where going to go with this i think anyone objects you doing forms of energy but are you going to take out of the lead of confronting climate looking at it very tom tell you what i have an open mind to it going to look very carefully one issue interesting because there are few things where more division than climate change you tend to hear but there are people on the other side of that issue who even we do hear it i was on with this so i got an earful of it is one of them but a lot of smart people disagree with you i have a very open mind and going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and going to look at it very carefully but i have an open mind since living on an i want to thank you for having an open mind we saw what these storms are now seen it personally straight up but you have an open mind on i do have an open mind and had storms not like this you know the hottest day ever was in 98 you you can make lots of cases for different views i have a totally open mind my uncle was for 35 years a professor at he was a great scientist he was a great guy and he was a long time he had feelings this was a long time ago he had feelings on this subject a very complex subject not sure anybody is ever going to really know i know we they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists where was in or wherever five years terrible where they got you so you see that and you this all about i absolutely have an open mind i will tell you clean air is vitally important clean crystal clean water is vitally important safety is vitally important and you you mentioned a lot of the courses i have some very successful golf courses received so many environmental awards for the way you know done a tremendous amount of work where received tremendous numbers sometimes say actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand true open mind editorial page when you say an open you mean just not sure whether human activity causes climate do you think human activity is or i think right now i think there is some connectivity there is something it depends on how much it also depends on how much going to cost our companies you have to our companies are noncompetitive right now really largely noncompetitive about four weeks i started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my that lost 70 , 000 factories since w bush 70 , 000 when i first looked at the i must be a typo it be you have you think you have 70 , 000 factories and it a right lost 70 , 000 factories not a competitive nation with other nations anymore we have to make ourselves competitive not competitive for a lot of reasons becoming more and more of the reason because a lot of these countries that we do business they make deals with our or and then they adhere to the you know that and much less expensive for their companies to produce products so going to be studying that very and i think i have a very big voice in it and i think my voice is listened especially by people that believe in it and let you know hate to see royal underwater the north that could a good bureau i just wanted to follow up on the question you were asked about not pursuing any investigations into did you mean both the email investigation and the foundation investigation you will not pursue either one of you know have people that do things but my inclination would for whatever power i have on the is to say go forward this has been looked at for so long ad go forward and you you could also make the case that some good work was done in the foundation and they could have made etc etc i think i think time for people to say go and solve some of the problems that we which are massive problems you i do think that gone through a lot i think losing is going through a lot it was a it was a very tough evening for her i think losing is going through a lot for whatever my attitude is strongly we have to go we have so many different problems to i think we have to delve back in the past i also think that would be a very well i think it would be very you know talking about bringing and then they go into all sorts of i think it would be very divisive for the country i i think speaking not as a journalist very healthy and then going to go d white house mike shear i cover the white covering your administration see ya there just one quick clarification on the climate do you intend as you pull out of the climate going to take a look at it shear and if the reaction from foreign leaders is to slap tariffs on goods to offset the carbon that the united states had pledged to is that with and then the second question is on your sort of mixing of your global business interests and the presidency even just in the two weeks been instances where met with your business partners sure talked about the impact of the wind farms on your golf course experts who are lawyers and ethics say that all of that is totally so i guess the question for you what do you see as the appropriate structure for keeping those two things and are there any lines that you think you want to cross once in the white first of on countries i think that countries will not do that to us i think if run by a person that understands leadership and negotiation in no position to do that to no matter what i do in no position to do that to and that but going to take a look at it a very serious look i want to also see how much this is you the cost to and be talking to you folks in the future about having to do with what just took place as far as you potential conflict of i mean i know that from the the law is totally on my the president have a conflict of interest been reported very widely despite i want there to be a conflict of interest anyway and the the president and i understand why the president have a conflict of interest now because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of but i built a very great company and a big company and all over the world people are starting to when they look at all these different like in and other number a job like that builds great relationships with the people of so all good but i have to the partners come very successful people they come they it be possible to have a my children are working on that job so i can say to want to have a i can take a picture i i think wonderful to take a picture fine with a picture but if it were up to some i would ever see my daughter again that would be like you never seeing your son again that be good that be good but ever see my daughter that means have to make deputy you know i i yeah i do that either i that work i do i would never see i guess the only son be allowed to at least for a little would be because 10 so there has to be a very interesting case you could sell your company with all due you could sell your company and then well and then you could see them all the time a very hard thing to you know because i have real estate i have real estate all over the which now people are understanding when i filed my forms with the federal people really a big a big it really is all over the world a great company with great assets i think you selling real estate like selling stock selling real estate is much in a much different world say and i mean this and i said it on the other my company is so unimportant to me relative to what i need i need and by the very i have a very small percentage of my money in very very small percentage of my money in in banks have said like to loan you like to give you any amount of been there had it both been been especially as you get is much better just a because an important question i care about my company i if a partner comes in from or if a partner comes in from where we did a beautiful big building that just and they want to take a picture and come into my and my kids come in i originally made the deal with these i mean what am i going to not going to talk to not going to take you have you on a human you take pictures but i just want to say that i am given the right to do something so important in terms of so many of the issues we in terms of health in terms of so many different things i care about my company it matter my kids run it say i have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on so every time somebody stays at that if they stay because i guess you could say a conflict of interest a conflict of but not going to have anything to do with the and they may very well i mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was the brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before i help but i care i said on i care because it matter the only thing that matters to me is running our country political can i press you a little further on what structures you would put in place to keep the presidency and the company separate and to avoid things for were reported in the times in the past 24 hours about meeting with leaders of about wind farms about meeting with leaders of about wind farms that might interfere with the views of your golf course and how to what can you talk about that by the was i involved with the wind farms not that i know of i i have a problem with wind but you brought it up in the which i know i might have with leaders of many with i see i might have brought it up but not having to do with just i the wind is a very deceiving thing first of we make the windmills in the united states made in and japan made out of massive amounts of which goes into the whether in our country or it goes into the atmosphere the windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies in other subsidizing wind mills all over this country i for the most part they work i think they work at all without and that bothers and they kill all the birds you go to a you know in they have what is the golden and if you shoot a golden they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them they actually have to get permits that only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year the windmills are devastating to the bird with that being a place for them but they do need subsidy if i talk negatively been saying the same thing for years about you the wind industry i want to subsidize it some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things i just including the and some but hard to explain i care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country but the just to be the question how do you formalize the separation of these things so that there is not a question of whether or not you as president are trying to influence like wind i want to influence because not not that important to me hard to explain but the according to the see i figured something where you put something in this massive trust and also nothing is written in other in i can be president of the united states and run my business 100 sign checks on my which i am phasing out of very you i sign the type i like to sign checks so i know what is going on as opposed to pressing a computer and thousands of checks are automatically sent it it tells me going on a little bit and it tells contractors that watching but i am phasing that out and handing that to trump and don trump and trump for the most and some of my so happening right now but in theory i could run my business and then run the country perfectly and never been a case like this where if you look at other people of they have this kind of asset and this kind of frankly just a different thing but there is no i assumed that have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you know and i was actually a little bit surprised to see it so in theory i have to do anything but i would like to do something i would like to try and formalize because i care about my business is going to run very nice we own this incredible place in we own many incredible including i guess you heard one guy that does when i say you know what that right do a little but going to run we have good going to run really well so i have to do but i want to do something if i can if there is something can you promise us when you decide exactly what that come tell the new times about i will started it already one of our great by the way i can see that started it already i greatly reduced the and the business greatly reduced meetings with meetings with different people you also started by said over the last two once i decided i wanted to i want to build anything like for we built the post be happy to ahead of schedule and under budget substantially ahead of schedule almost two years ago of schedule but ahead of under and a terrific place the hotel on just so you general electric has a big wind turbine factory in south just so you know well good but most of are made in most of are you and the are making most of them they may assemble if you i think find that delivered there and they do most of the assembly white house sorry i entered but i did want to ask you about you should introduce yourself one of the white house correspondents i apologize for my delayed flight i wanted to ask you about personnel they say personnel is policy i quite hear personnel personnel you hired to be the chief strategist for you in the white house he is a hero of the been described by some as racist and i wonder what message you think you have sent by elevating him to that position and what you would say to those who feel like that indicates something about the kind of country you prefer and the government run known a long time if i thought he was a or or any of the things that we you the terms we can i even think about hiring him first of the one that makes the not or anybody else and will tell you that 100 percent and if he said something to me in terms of his or that i thought were inappropriate or number one i do and number he would have to be gone but i know many people that know and in actually getting some very good press from a lot of the people that know and people that are on the left but went to he was you he was very he was a naval i think you i think very hard on him i think having a hard time with it because not him not him known him for a long time a very smart guy i think he was with on top of everything else what do you make of the website he the different cover i mean like the new times covers things i i could say that is because they covered an story i i am take whatever you say i am always but not cross the new times covers a lot of stories that you rough stories and you they have covered some of these but the new times covers a lot of these things also just a essentially a newspaper i know the a decent a very smart guy done a good job he been with me that long you know he really came in after the primaries i had already won the primaries and if i thought that his views were in that i would immediately let him go and tell you why in many respects i think his views are actually on the other side of what a lot of people might think but you are with all due that and and many folks who disagree with the coverage of and the slant that brings to the news view him that well first of is just a publication you they cover stories like you cover stories they are certainly a much more conservative to put it than the new times but really is a news organization become quite and got readers and it does cover subjects that are on the but it covers subjects on the left also i mean a pretty a pretty big thing and he helped build it into a pretty successful news organization tell you i know him very well i will say and i will say if i thought that if i thought that he was doing or had any ideas that were different than the ideas that you would i would ask him very politely to leave but in the i think been treated very unfairly very interesting a lot of people are coming to his defense right now we have never experienced a single episode of any of those accusations been the total opposite been a great and just not there and what the is saying is 100 percent true and by the if you see something or get something where you feel that and you have some info i would love to hear it you can call can call i would love to hear the only one who call me is opinion she treats me too rough i know what happened to she was so opinion for years she was so good as we all say about not your just your turn opinion i have a slightly but somewhat i guess about the future of the republican party you started out here talking about winning in so many states where no republican has won in especially rust belt states and i think many people think that one of the reasons you won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of republican you had different things to say on foreign even your daughter child care plan was sort of distinctive and now in a situation where governing and staffing up an administration with a republican party whose and may differ with me a little on but always see on those views although right now loving me right now they are right now loves loves amazing how winning can change things liked chuck for a long time raised a lot of money for chuck and given him a lot of money over the years i think i was the first person that ever contributed to chuck i had a a little in a little apartment building in in bay where i worked with my father and chuck came in and i gave i i know if willing to admit but i believe it was his first campaign but chuck a good guy i think get along very well i guess my question how much do you expect to be able to both run an administration and negotiate with a congress as a different kind of republican and do you worry that wake up three years from now and go back to campaigning in the rust belt and people will he governed more like than like trump i worry about that i need to do this i was telling i need to do this doing this to do a good what i want to and i think that what happened in the rust they call it the rust belt for a reason if you go through you look back 20 they used to call it the rust belt you pass factory after factory after factory empty and rusting rust is the good worse than falling down i sacrifice that to me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to to love as opposed to the political people and frankly if the political people take care of these not going to win and going to end up with maybe a total different kind of government than what looking at right now these people are really angry and angry i call them the forgotten men and women and i use that in i say the forgotten people they were totally forgotten and going to bring jobs back going to bring jobs big league spoken to so many companies i plan on moving your not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product you think going to just sell it across what will be a strong you know at least going to have a border but just plan on it and tell i and hear announcements over the next couple of but i believe talked numerous comp in conversations with top people numerous companies that or potentially leaving our country with thousands of jobs are you that those companies will keep their factories but the jobs will be replaced by they and make the robots too a big make the robots too right now we make the robots we make anything but going i robotics is becoming very big and going to do that going to have more factories we lose 70 , 000 factories just do it going to start making things i was honored i got a call from bill great we had a great i got a call from cook at and i you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when i get apple to build a big plant in the united or many big plants in the united where instead of going to and going to and going to the places that you go making your product right he understand i think create the incentives for and i think going to do it going for a very large tax cut for which be happy but going for big tax we have to get rid of regulations are making it impossible whether liberal or i mean i could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous gotten to be a and companies they even start they choking i tell one thing i would giving a big tax cut and giving big regulation and seen all of the small business owners over the united and all of the big business met so many people they are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut and i never said because the tax going to be substantial you know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high but leaving also because of the regulations and i would of the and i would not have thought regulation substantial regulation are more important and more enthusiastically than even the big tax cuts i wanted to ask there was a conference this past weekend in of people who pledged their allegiance to you are really into this i think we answered that one right off the bat are you going to condemn of course i of course i did he already did are you going to do it right i maybe you here sure would you like me to do it do it here of course i condemn i disavow and condemn go with that like to move to and then go back because a lot of the investment you are talking a lot of the jobs you are talking about is infrastructure going to be the core of your first few not the but an important factor going for a lot of between between between health care going to talk repeal and replace health care is you know people are paying a 100 percent increase and not even getting the deductibles are so you have deductibles so paying all of this money and they even get health care so very important so there are a lot of things but is going to be a part of it part of i even think a big part of it going to be a big number but i think i am doing things that are more important than but infrastructure is still a part of and talking about a very infrastructure bill and not a very republican thing i even know frankly it worked for franklin it work for because unfortunately they spend the money last time on infrastructure they spent it on a lot of other things you nobody can find out where that last you from a few years ago where that money went and going to make sure it is spent on infrastructure and roads and highways i have a a big one of the biggest and he orders these incredible the i mention the name but a certain truck company that makes they call them the of trucks you the most expensive trucks and he calls me up about two months ago and he going to buy the cheapest trucks i can and i and you and this is the biggest guy he trucks are coming going from new to and all busted up the highways are in such bad hitting hitting he not buying these trucks going to buy the cheapest stuff and the strongest tires i can the exact expression he cheapest trucks and the strongest hitting so many bad you i tell been doing this how 45 years he built it over 45 years i you ever seen it like he roads have never been like an interesting what what curious what and said when you going to launch a infrastructure are they reluctant to spend honestly right now trillion i was the figure because they would be in the wing of the republican party that would but not going to be able to do that and balance the see if i get it done right now in love with me four weeks ago they in love with me forget if i read the new and you have to put this on the record it can be if you you might not want you say but you do i do read it unfortunately i would have lived about 20 years longer if i quote right there if love to reread it i know but when you look at the all the i was going to lose the i was going to take the house with and the senate had no chance it was going to be the biggest humiliation in the history of politics in this country and instead i won the and i mean easily you look at those i had states where i won by 30 and 40 points i won the presidency i helped numerous senators in fact the only senators that get elected were two one up in new who refused to say that she was going to vote for who by the way would love a job in the administration and i thank on the record this is where different than a politician i know what to i just believe sort of interesting love to have a job in the i thank she refused to vote for me and a senator in who frankly he endorsed me then he and he went down like a lead balloon and then they called me before the race and said they wanted me to endorse him and do a big thing and i thank good you see what happens i off the i hope you lose off the record he he was up by 10 points you know who talking about others if you look at he was down five points a few days before the he called for i gave him and i think i was up like over 30 points in i was leading by a massive 28 points i gave him help and he ended up winning by four points or something i brought a number of them brought over the finish line we brought you that was a good one we brought him over the line in winning was big something that i came so right now in very good but i came here thinking be awed and overwhelmed by this but i feel like you are getting very comfortable with it i feel comfortable i feel comfortable i am awed by the as anybody would but i i feel so comfortable and you know it would to a great achievement if i could come back here in a year or two years and say and have a lot of the folks here done a great and i mean just a conservative not talking conservative i mean done a good job to follow up on after you met with president he described you to folks as that you seemed overwhelmed by what he told you so i wonder if you are overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job that about to inherit and if you can tell us anything more about that conversation with the president and the apparently subsequent conversations that had on the phone since then and then maybe talk a little bit about foreign something we touched on and whether or not you believe in the kind of world order a world order led by in terms of having this country underwrite the security and the free markets of the which have been in place for decades sure i had a great meeting with president i never met him before i really liked him a lot the meeting was supposed to be 10 15 minutes because there were a lot of people waiting for both of us and it ended up being you were there i guess an close and it was a great chemistry i think if he said i think he meant that in a bad way i think he meant that it is a very overwhelming job but not overwhelmed by it you can do things and fix i think he meant it that way he said very nice things after the meeting and i said very nice things about him i really enjoyed my meeting with him we have you we come from different sides of the but nevertheless something that i know if like him i probably thought that maybe i but i i did like him i really enjoyed him a lot spoken to him since the meeting what did you say to just a basic conversation i think looking to do absolutely the right thing for the country in terms of transition and i telling we had a that went for an hour and a half that could have gone for three or four hours it was a great it was just a very good meeting sort of like this meeting he told me what he thought what the biggest problems of the country which i think i should i mind if he reveals them but i was actually surprised a little bit but he told me the he told me things that he considered but he did tell me what he thought were the biggest in particular one problem that he thought was a big problem for the which rather have you ask him but i really found the meeting to be very good and i hope we can have a good i it mean going to agree on but i hope that we will have a great relationship i really liked him a lot and a little bit surprised telling you that i really liked him a lot go foreign sure sure what do you see as role in the do you believe that the role such a big question the role that we played for 50 years as kind of the global paying more for things because they were in our ultimate one hears from i is really shrinking that role i think we should be a nation builder i think tried that i happen to think that going into was perhaps i mean you could say maybe we could have settled the civil i think going into was one of the great mistakes in the history of our country i think getting out of it i think we got out of it then lots of bad things including the formation of we could have gotten out of it differently i think going in was a terrible mistake we have to solve that problem because we are going to just keep fighting forever i have a different view on than everybody else not everybody but then a lot of people i had to listen to give me a break i had to listen to graham talk you attacking and you and like now attacking attacking attacking and what are we getting and what are we and i have some very i have some very strong ideas on i think happened is a horrible thing to look at the and not just talking deaths on our which are but the deaths i mean you look at these where massive and they say two people were injured thousands of people have died and i think a shame and ideally we can get do something with i spoke to as you he called essentially how do you see that essentially everybody called all of the major and most of them spoken to will you have a reset with i use that term after what you previously i think i would love to be able to get along with and i think like to be able to get along with us in our mutual interest and i go in with any preconceived but i will tell i would say when they used to during the trump loves loves i it be say this in front of thousands of it be nice to actually report what they it be nice if we actually got along with it be nice if we went after which by the aside from being very and have been even allowed to and the people will stand up and give me a massive hand you know they thought it was bad that i was getting along with or that i believe strongly if we can get along with a positive thing it is a great thing that we can get along with not only but that we get along with other countries managing on would you you said you have a very strong idea about what to do with the can you describe that for i can only say we have to end that craziness going on in one of the things that was told to me can i say this off the or is everything on the if you want to i want to i want to violate a if you want to go off the we have agreed you can go off the record ladies and we are off the record for this moment speaks off the now we can go back on going to play the cop here got only two and a half minutes because they have a hard stop at 2 and by the i want to thank you on behalf of all of us thank you for this and really i mean that we are back on the record you get the last question is he a tough is he i have two very quickly one is your vice left open the idea of returning to you talked about that on the campaign trail hoping you can talk about how you view torture at this and also what are you hoping that will do in your administration and will you bring him in i hear the second question what will role be in your oh maybe nothing because i want to have people saying even though the president of the united states i hope whoever is writing this written fairly the president of the united states is allowed to have whatever conflicts he wants he or she wants but i want to go by that a very smart guy a very good guy the people that know a quality person and i think he can be very helpful i would love to be able to be the one that made peace with and the i would love that would be such a great achievement because been able to do it do you think he can be part of i think be very good at it i mean he knows it so well he knows the knows the knows the players i would love to be and you can put that down in a list of many things that like to be able to do now a lot of people tell really great people tell that you do it had a lot great businesspeople tell you do impossible i i think you can make peace i think people are tired now of being killed at some when do they i think we can do that i have reason to believe i can do that and on where are you and i met with general who is a very respected guy in i met with a number of other they say the finest there is he is being seriously considered for secretary of which is i think time time for a general look at going on we we beat we win anymore at anything we win on the we win with we certainly win with the military general is a highly dignified man i met with him at length and i asked him that question i what do you think of he said i was surprised he never found it to be he always give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and i do better with that than i do with and i was very impressed by that answer i was because known as being like the toughest guy and when he said not saying it changed my mind we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and not allowed to but tell you i was impressed by that answer it certainly does not not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think if so important to the i would go for it i would be guided by that but general found it to be very less much less important than i thought he would say i thought he would say you know known as mad dog mad dog for a reason i thought say lose he actually give me some cigarettes and some and do with going to go to our mark for the last question very powerful man mark thank and a really short but after all the talk about libel and libel are you committed to the first amendment to the i was hoping he going to say that i think be happy i think be happy somebody said to me on they a great softening up those but you may get sued a lot i i never thought about i i have to start thinking about i think be i think going to be fine thank you very much for this really appreciate this thank you very a great honor i will the times a great jewel a world jewel and i hope we can all get along

the future of financial regulation is murky given the conflicting statements by j congressional republicans and senate democrats some may but looking at the whole there may be some cause for a least when it comes to the big banks and the concept of big to the starting point in all of this is trump himself his campaign rhetoric was hardly bank friendly he called for breaking up the big as well as for enactment of a 21st century the law that separated commercial banking from investment a restriction that was repealed during the administration since big banks have become bigger the four largest banks wells bank of and control more than 33 percent of banking according to the federal and 43 percent of deposits the house led by who is said to be a candidate for treasury have proposed their own financial overhaul in a bill of more than 500 pages the known as the financial choice which was proposed before would substantially change the way banks are regulated under the 2010 act established a financial stability oversight board with power over systemic risk and the ability to designate like insurance companies as systemically important it subjects big banks and other financial institutions to heightened regulation if those companies also established an orderly process for liquidating them capital charges were put on big and the rule limited trading by among a host of other requirements house bill does away with much of this regulation there is a chapter 14 inserted into the bankruptcy code to allow these entities to be reorganized in bankruptcy the rule is repealed banks have options to avoid the restrictions these are not unreasonable changes the orderly liquidation authority was criticized because it required multiple approvals for liquidation with one day for a court to consider the making it unlikely to be used and making liquidation anything but orderly the existence of an oversight board seems conceptually fine but also adds a layer of bureaucracy where the government has not proved particularly good at spotting financial crises has anyone of the house bill has lots of other stuff the consumer financial protection bureau would be turned into a normal agency with commissioners appointed by the president its authority would be and it would be barred from limiting consumer arbitration as it is proposing the house bill also cuts a swath through other financial regulation it eliminates rules on fees and the department of fiduciary duty standard it lowers the compensation disclosure requirements for public including cutting the requirement that companies disclose the amount and ratio of chief executive pay to the median employee salary will the trump plan or the house plan win the simple trump plan seems to focus on making banks smaller and taking away the regulatory oversight and safety net on the other the republican plan does not do away with financial it simply makes what the republicans view as reasonable modifications to allow the banks to operate more effectively thrown into this mix are the senate democrats under the senate 60 votes will be needed to bring any legislation revising to a vote the republicans have 51 senators and maybe depending on the results of the runoff on 10 new chuck the leader of the senate has already said that although there are areas of common ground on republican plans for infrastructure there is no such agreement on financial regulation so assuming the democrats hold the any legislative repeal of is unlikely and although some democrats may cross getting eight or nine will be almost impossible so where does that leave very likely there will be a muddle areas where the president can act without congress are likely to see the most change if trump adopts the house republican things like the financial stability oversight board will wither the designation of systemically important financial institutions for insurance companies will also go away the rest will depend on what trump wants and who he picks for treasury secretary all three rumored potential candidates would seem to be more in favor of the republican house bill than the ideas trump put forth they may try a compromise that the democrats can buy into compromise can only go so far dismantling the consumer financial protection bureau is probably a nonstarter given that 60 senate votes are necessary to modify the it is likely to remain in the budget is protected from congress and the president it can continue on its current at least until trump appoints a new director in two years but there may be more common ground on how to deal with the big banks this is because the proposals in the house bill concerning bank regulation are worth and the changes to regulation of the big banks have credible support in reasonable quarters for the bankruptcy option seems more viable than a liquidation authority that will never be used in an article in professors a and mark j roe wrote that core concept behind the bill bankruptcy for banks is noting that there it needed some tweaks to be including allowing regulators to force banks into bankruptcy the exit ramp from may also not be viewed as a watering down of regulations the financial services law firm stated that the standard a high and its utility was because of this even some of the consumer financial protection proposals make despite being unlikely to pass reconstituting the agency into one like the securities and exchange commission or the federal trade with commissioners appointed by the president and split among the would make the agency more responsive to democratic government and better able to enact regulation the ideas to limit public overly burdensome compensation which do not seem to do much but impose substantial would also seem ripe for elimination some of these proposals are complaints about forced arbitration are real and merit discussion the elimination of the rule or the revival of restrictions would mean a fundamental restructuring of the financial system it is something worth thinking despite my whether needs big banks but one thing is sure as long as the democrats hold the there will be no wholesale erasure of regulation despite the controversy and the republican house bill contains provisions that might make sense worth discussing the question which no one has the answer to what will trump

there was no avoiding fearful memories of the nuclear disaster of 2011 on morning after a powerful earthquake off the coast of caused a cooling system in a nuclear plant to leaving more than 2 , 500 spent uranium fuel rods at risk of overheating but this the electric power or the utility that operates three nuclear restored the cooling pump at the plant in about an hour and a half the plant is about seven miles south of the ruined plant where three reactors melted down five years ago after tsunami waves inundated the power station and knocked out backup generators reported that it never lost power at either the plant or its neighbor to the north after the which had a magnitude of according to the weather service took the regular actions that we should take when handling acting general manager of the nuclear power division at said at a news conference on the company was prepared for big having built sea walls rising to about 46 feet at the plants and enclosing backup generators in waterproof said critics of which struggled to keep on top of a crisis that unfolded over the weeks that followed the calamity in said they were relieved that there had been no immediate damage but they said they remained skeptical that the company had done enough to prepare for a disaster on the scale of the earthquake five years ago that which had a magnitude of set off tsunami waves as high as 130 feet in some places highest waves on reached about 55 looks like the right things have been said director of the future design institute at the institute of technology and a volunteer researcher with an independent group you never know until something happens as far as this morning they did a decent but mainly because it that big of an earthquake or that big of a building higher sea for all but that is like fighting the last brown said remains to be seen how well prepared they would be for some other unusual combination of compared with five years has improved its communication with the reporting information about the cooling pump at almost as it happened on morning the company also quickly said that it had suspended the treatment and transfer of contaminated water from the where an extensive cleanup and decommissioning process is underway by the those operations had been restored i can say is response was decent and they seemed to be said director of the research center for nuclear weapons abolition at university he it would be difficult to independently verify claims because the nuclear regulation authority depends on the company to release information he added that he was not convinced that was being fully transparent about its particularly about the cleanup at the plant should be informed fully whether this operation is reasonably done with cost effectiveness and safety and making sure that the best technology is being said a spokesman for the nuclear regulation said the agency had offices on the sites of the nuclear plants and worked with and other utility companies on to confirm that the power stations were safe after the earthquake regarding the nuclear experts expressed concern about the safety of the cleanup operation at the plant the melted cores of three reactors have yet to be removed as they are still too radioactive for workers to approach since the 2011 groundwater seeps into the reactors daily the contaminated by the melted fuel needs to be treated and stored on site so has built more than 880 tanks of about 1 , 000 tons each the tanks are inspected four times a day to confirm that they do not

fully and groundwater continues to flow into the reactors critics worry that the sea walls or storage tanks might not withstand a more powerful earthquake or tsunami and incident at the reactor showed that quakes can set off problems even at plants that are not operating most of the 54 plants remain closed since the 2011 but the administration of prime minister wants to restart most of them a majority of the public is opposed to such a move candidates for governor who ran campaigns opposed to the revival have won elections in recent months in two prefectures that host nuclear plants according to the a the chairman of and the were planning to meet on with one of those of to try to persuade him to support a restart of the plant there and returned to after the earthquake who oversaw an independent investigation on the nuclear accident for the said that building walls and storage tanks failed to solve the underlying problem of an country relying on nuclear power he both the government and utility companies should invest in developing alternative sources of power like solar or wind technology think we expect more of such readjusting plate movements and that has been reasonably and many volcanic activity and earthquakes have been rampant over the last five said an adjunct professor at the national graduate institute for policy studies why are we continuing to restart nuclear
maybe i have been surprised that trump could be elected but i was i live in and work in two of the most liberal places in the country but even i seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in that failure makes sense spent nearly 10 years coaching and and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i want to and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an or clicked on a or hid the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i realize that most of my family who live in rural were voicing their support for trump and i see any of the that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my and the only election day i saw were of people declaring their support for to be not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my they did exactly what i told them to blocking out misogynist and hiding anyone who support black lives all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than 40 percent of our population consumes news on finding alternative perspectives have been that hard i knew about theory on filter or the idea that personalization distorts the type of information we and even i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my and yet i look in mark chief executive of addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network he has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever he said gone from a world of isolated communities to one global and we are all better off for but not what has happened idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on the political divide has only been entrenched further the dress only for our entire we are two one that sees blue and black and the other that sees white and gold the once offered outlets we could use to understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like and is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into but there have still been a few islands of digital a of where culture thrived untouched they included vine closure was announced in and and even which were homes for marginalized theories and lifestyles the vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see aware a young woman living in who goes by the name used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the goofing off at home in her most viral she stares into the her face covered in a save for her perfectly outlined eyes called me she snaps the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the and people did so with meaning that vines appeared around the defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text direct email vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black named who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be pretty you can draw a straight line from brown women in to black women in a marvel unto a window into the way the flattens space and time a vivid example of its fulfilling its promise to bridge divides at it had more than 200 million monthly users who watched videos billions of and it excelled at showing these sorts of black kids in new lived and looked a lot like white kids in the very they shared a similar humor and taste in which gave me hope that they would share a sense of humanity as and yet which owns vine and is struggling to turn a profit while keeping its main service appealing to could seemingly no longer afford to keep the video feature reportedly costs millions a month to afloat following news about decision to close the there were rumors that outside companies made inquiries about purchasing remains but most likely too late to salvage the community there in its earlier offered its own version of cultural exchange the had an incredible series on that gave users direct windows into different worlds people submitted short video diaries about life in their which the company compiled into a single viewable by anyone using the i remember feeling delighted watching people in and showing off their routines and customs but the company is now prioritizing which feature more mainstream events like the super bowl and music festivals the effect is still but less intimate seems to be betting that people are more interested in the familiar the future of the platform whose endless warren of rabbit holes about gender critical feminist thought and identity politics is unlike any other on the is the most uncertain its parent succumbed to financial struggles and has announced plans to be acquired by raising questions about the future of its properties what seeing with and vine reflects a larger shift in the economy by and is not lucrative at a scale that satisfies and as a most companies are changing direction toward other revenue streams one of the more significant shifts is the move into social messaging semiprivate messaging applications group text threads and applications like is owned by and slack have grown in popularity as people move away from public arenas for a shift caused in part by spikes in unchecked harassment on major social networks new features are introduced it to make messaging with your friends more the latest version of the software includes the ability to make messages with confetti now offers the ability to tag people in as you might tag them in a photograph these changes have probably been spurred by messaging applications which used similar features to attract and retain customers a company that built an addictive messaging with 220 million monthly users had one of the biggest initial public offerings billion earlier this these new messaging features work to bind private groups tighter by making it more fun to talk to one another than to engage with the world at large what happens when we would rather look i have found something of an answer in a short story called great by about search for signs of alien life the story is narrated by a parrot in home to one of the largest radio telescopes in the world desire to make a connection is so strong that created an ear capable of hearing across the the creature begins i and my fellow parrots are right here why they interested in listening to our the paradox is not to be we are more interested in locating alien species than understanding the humanity among the species we already live with the story ends on a somber note activity has brought my kind to the brink of the narrator explains do it maliciously they just paying lesson hits hard in this new political and cultural moment social media seemed to promise a way to better connect with instead it seems to have made it easier to tune out the people we agree with but if we pay attention to one we might as well not live on the same planet at all

a joint new state and federal investigation into how false reports of gunfire at international airport in august led to mass panic found security protocols seriously with poor coordination between agencies and widely divergent levels of training for security personnel exacerbating the chaos within minutes of the first reports of gunfire on the night of a wave of panic swept across the airport as thousands of travelers and receiving no official took it upon themselves to run or hide the investigation by the task the details of which were outlined in a letter released by gov m on offered the first official account of how fear led to hysteria and ultimately put lives at risk the task force cited a failure of where the lack of clear lines of authority and poor communication led to one of the busiest transit hubs grinding to a halt the episode also raised serious concerns about what would have happened if it had not been a false alarm but an actual emergency this although thousands of people participated in an uncontrolled immediate there were no significant according to the letter from the john f international airport security review team that summarized the findings and was sent to a and the secretary of homeland security the danger posed by a panicked mass of people fleeing for their lives cannot be and said in statements that they would implement a series of recommendations to deal with the problems that the episode including the creation of a single unified command center to oversee security operations for the airport the panic started with the most unlikely of the victory of the track during the summer it was around when patrons at the caf in terminal 8 erupted in celebration review of the videotape from the incident shows passengers in the terminal panicking immediately after the the letter said at someone called 911 to report a disturbance in the terminal more calls followed and were echoed by people taking to social many claiming shots had been fired things escalated rapidly police officers for the port authority of new and new which operates the drew their weapons and advanced to where they thought there might be a according to the findings at the same federal agents with the transportation security administration to run with passengers from the public area of terminal according to the letter after the initial reports of a shooter in terminal 8 were additional reports of a shooter in terminal 1 and 2 were received by 911 the letter said in terminal officers from customs and border protection took a guns which caused passengers at the federal inspection service area to panic some fled the area through emergency exits onto the tarmac returned to the gate and boarded a air where airline employees deployed its emergency evacuation producing a sound that may have been mistaken for the letter said in 275 police officers responded to the false including 88 from the port authority and 187 members of the new police department the letter noted that as the threat of terrorism has so too has security with local and private security forces all deployed at the airport the number of security personnel has the coordination and standard protocols have not adjusted to the increased the letter said in addition to establishing a unified command and said they would implement coordinated training for the various security forces at the airport after the chaos at the airport scores of travelers began to question how after more than 15 years of increased vigilance and warnings about the threat of terrorism not to mention the billions of dollars spent to combat the threat there was seemingly no evacuation plan in place the authorities said that would change security plan should be developed to address mass the letter said one difficulty that needs to be addressed surrounds the most visible layer of airport the agents employees are not armed law and are trained to in the event of an active violence checkpoints could be left vulnerable in these the letter said one recommendation was to add armed law enforcement to the checkpoints events at were a call to rethink and our security procedures to reflect the changing reality of threats and to better ensure the safety of all new said recommendations will serve as a national model to better train our airport establish new protocols to respond to and enhance coordination and communication among all
j trump ran for president boasting that he knew more about fighting terrorists than generals but now that trump is the he is spending a great deal of his time with retired and those of a particular commanders when they were often at odds with president one has been named as national security and several others are candidates for coveted positions in his cabinet or are advising him on how to confront the greatest threats they would give his foreign policy a far more aggressive cast than turning to the retired officers reflects preference for having even men around him but it worries national security experts and even other retired who say that if trump stacks critical jobs purely with it could lead to an undue emphasis on military force in foreign policy you have too many generals in the the dish is likely to be baked with even more military instruments said john a a retired army lieutenant colonel and an expert in counterinsurgency strategy not sure the recipe the united states needs for every foreign policy inclination toward generals in top jobs also runs counter to the credo of civilian control of the military a constitutionally enshrined principle that some say safeguards the united states from becoming another or where the military is a political player in the last trump has met with n a retired marine corps who has emerged as a leading candidate for secretary of john another retired marine who is in the running for secretary of jack a former army vice chief of who said he had turned down an offer from vice mike pence to run the and admiral s the director of the national security of those under is the only job candidate still on active duty and is a prospect for director of national intelligence closest foreign policy adviser is gen t a former head of the defense intelligence who was named as national security adviser on aides also sounded out gen a a former commander in for defense according to people briefed on the transition and they briefly mulled h a former director of the who also served as commander in for secretary of state what several of these generals share is a rocky history in the administration the white house forced general out of his last citing poor management of an agency with 20 , 000 employees general who oversaw military operations in the middle east and southwest from 2010 to had his tour cut short by the which believed he was too hawkish on general opposed the plan to shut down the military prison at fired general after he disparaged other officials in an interview with rolling while as failed in his effort to persuade to supply arms to moderate rebels in eventually did provide the and resignation in 2012 was prompted by an unrelated scandal involving his disclosure of classified material for the strained history of these generals with his predecessor is less a liability than a credential is sticking his tongue out at the prior said h a professor emeritus of history at the university of north at chapel hill who has written about civilian control of the military is inherently distrustful of the military people that the system throws up at him he thinks not strong people they are trump might also view generals in his administration as a political asset at a time when trust in institutions like congress and the news media is the military remains enduringly popular general in commands wide respect from uniformed men and women especially who revere him as one of their own on trump wrote on twitter that general was a k the chief said the incoming administration was looking at potential cabinet officials with combat experience so that people who had fought in wars would be making decisions about whether to commit the country to more of them generation that has fought in these wars is now coming into said a navy officer earlier in his career all come with a shared experience that is incredibly but general appointment because he would oversee the department where he used to serve would raise legal and political questions he would need a congressional waiver because the law requires a waiting period between active duty and serving as defense and he retired from the marines only in 2013 the last time a waiver was used was in when gen c then five years out of received one to be defense secretary for president harry s there is little doubt that general who is well liked by senator john republican of and the chairman of the senate armed services will be able to obtain that waiver himself appeared to try to hasten the issuing a statement on in which he said he was that the found general as impressive as i some experts said that installing a general at the top of the pentagon could muddy the principle of civilian control of the military president and the secretary of defense are the two leading figures in the chain of said peter d a political science professor at duke university who served in the w bush administration they are that embodies that gen carter f the retired head of the united states said the question of whether general was qualified to lead the pentagon was a dunk he absolutely but the reason the waiver put into law is that we are not a militaristic nor do we want to he said idea of senior military officers assuming senior positions in the civilian government that is worthy of beyond the constitutional there are bureaucratic hurdles that could stymie a military officer the defense secretary must navigate the politics of the white house and congress while balancing and in some resisting the views of his former colleagues in a famous defense secretary m gates overruled his many senior forcing through the development and purchase of more maneuverable and heavily armored known as to stem a rising tide of casualties from

despite fears that dementia rates were going to explode as the population grows older and and has more diabetes and high blood a large nationally representative survey has found the reverse dementia is actually on the wane and when people do get they get it at older and older ages previous studies found the same trend but involved much smaller and less diverse populations like the mostly white population of and residents of a few areas in england and wales the new study found that the dementia rate in 65 and older fell by 24 percent over 12 to 8 8 percent in 2012 from 11 6 percent in 2000 that trend is significant and said a demographer at the university of who was not associated with the study in people received a diagnosis of dementia at an average age of in the average age was 82 4 dementia rate is not said director of the national institute on aging can and that very good said john director of the division of behavioral and social research it he that a million and a half people aged 65 and older who do not have dementia now would have had it if the rate in 2000 had been in director of scientific programs and outreach at the said the group had been encouraged by some of the previous research showing a decline but had also been little bit about drawing conclusions because the populations in the earlier studies were so homogeneous he said of the new is a nationally representative study wonderful an estimated four million to five million currently have dementia it remains the most expensive disease in a study funded by the national institute on aging estimated that in 2010 it cost up to billion a year to care for dementia surpassing heart disease and cancer the published by the journal internal included 21 , 000 65 and older across all education and income who participate in the health and retirement which regularly surveys people and follows them as they age the national institute on aging funded the work but was not involved with the data analysis or interpretation to assess participants were among other to recall 10 nouns immediately and after a to serially subtract seven from and to count backward from 20 the test was based on extensive research indicating it was a good measure of memory and thinking skills participants also were asked about their education income and health in a the dementia decline might seem unexpected it occurred despite an increase in diabetes the diabetes prevalence among older surged to 21 percent in 2012 from 9 percent in 1990 it began to fall only very recently the study diabetes increased the risk of dementia by 39 percent more older people today also have cardiovascular risk factors high levels of blood blood sugar and cholesterol which increase the risk of dementia but more are taking medications for those so perhaps better control of those risk factors played a role in the decline the findings about obesity were especially puzzling compared with people of normal overweight people and obese people had a 30 percent lower risk of the study found underweight people had a risk 2 5 times as great yet the obesity picture is muddled because other studies have found that obesity in middle age increases dementia risk in old age then there is the education question on older in 2012 had one more year of schooling than older in 2000 and years of education were associated with decreased dementia risk in this as in many others it is still not clear exactly why education would reduce the risk of dementia there is the cognitive reserve that education changes developing brains in a good making them more resistant to and that people with more education have brains that are better able to compensate for dementia damage but education also is linked to more wealth people with more education often live in environments that differ from those of people who have less and they tend to have better health over all they also are less likely to smoke as for black the dementia risk was but some possible reasons less less more cardiovascular risk factors did not fully explain the difference one possibility is that they received a poorer quality of so each year of it offered less protection from said the lead in the much of what is happening with dementia rates defies said a professor of medicine at the university of in who also works in the veterans affairs health care system there a professor of medicine at rush university medical center in urged caution in accepting the conclusion that dementia rates were declining if they in accepting the possible explanations although he had nothing but praise for the abilities of the he noted that such studies were extremely difficult to do deciding if a respondent is demented can easily be inadvertently he said very said but the decline is consistent with what seems to be a despite failure to find any effective way for individuals to protect themselves from the most common form of dementia estimates that compared with the rate in the early there has been a 25 to 30 percent decrease in dementia rates among older as for the that is hard to said even with the lower prevalence of there will be many more older people in the united states over the next few especially people age 85 and who are at highest risk for that the total number of people with dementia should although not as much as had been estimated and there are forces acting against the continuation of the decline in dementia rates more people reaching age 65 and above in the next few decades will have been obese in middle possibly increasing their risk of dementia in the trend toward more years of schooling seems to have leveled so the education effect might not be as much of a factor but researchers remain optimistic the study found noted the real he to see if we can generate evidence of what causes
the election of j trump gives the republicans in congress a chance to act on their desire to get rid of a wish that trump mostly says he shares e and the health policy analysts for the then i think safe to say few in congress thought they would have this opportunity but like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the after untold futile republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the affordable care act now comes the essential will they actually do been promising it but i am still skeptical that it will happen i believe you disagree going to let you go first why do you think do i think do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of having passed bills to partly delay or the in the house something like 60 times just the other day senator endorsed repeal the house and senate also agreed to do in large in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year the only thing that prevented it was that president vetoed it i doubt trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity i know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full because according to the rules it can only touch provisions this excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime among other measures i also must add that much less confident of a repeal partial without agreement on a replacement but turn it back to do you think the has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer i think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier but not too much a part of me that thinks many in congress were always so willing to vote for a because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law they got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than 20 million people of their health without anything in return this would be an unmitigated political disaster the stories of people with diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold would very likely dominate our discussion for months that leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the 2018 midterm elections with no democratic leaders in any branch of government to i think this would be akin to what happened in the 2010 but in reverse if they can coalesce around a plan that leave too many people then i think they could move forward but in all the years since the was republicans been able to do that do you think they what do you think that plan would look one way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that call for repeal for several at least after the 2018 though possibly after the 2020 election between now and there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces that just dump people off coverage with no alternative but the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly absolutely there will be bad stories but keep in there will be bad stories under too rocketing huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if making better actually in a tough policy spot get the blame if they fix or repeal the and get the blame if they replace it with something people like better health policy is a very difficult and thankless task i think opt for something they can call repeal and but they could also just let struggle and die neither looks good one other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states do you think a trump working with a will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from if what are some ideas states might i think very likely those in congress could punt to the states for been trying to change funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time this will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce spending in the while forcing states to make the tough decisions and take the blame for cuts in either beneficiaries or services fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the is a different story without some sort of market which generally been opposed the same problems that existed with respect to conditions and individual ratings will exist many people will become uninsured annual and lifetime limits could reappear lots of people will have problems getting insured i have yet to be convinced that a significant number of republicans in the house might coalesce around such a plan maybe for but not sure about the exchanges even if they likely the democrats in the senate would try to filibuster either of these plans you i think democrats would filibuster anything they could the filibuster is not set in stone a senate majority can change and some are already calling for the to do so but that appear to be what the senate will do retain the filibuster this could play to their since they can propose things they let the democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement perhaps another way for republicans to get out of their political bind sure have more to discuss as president administration comes into power
a man was on a train in reading a novel set in japan the train slid past the bound for where the was headed the year was 1989 the train was a bullet train the man on the train was in a and the man in the novel he was reading was in a and as he read the it emerged that his quandary and the one in the novel were essentially the same the man in the novel was a priest sent to japan in the 17th century he was there to minister to catholics suffering under a brutal regime and also to find out what had happened to his a priest rumored to have renounced the faith under torture the man on the train was martin he was in japan to play the part of van in a movie by another master filmmaker he was also there to move past a brutal battle in culture wars over a picture of last temptation of the film had been pilloried by conservative for a dream sequence in which has sex with in depicting life as a struggle between his human and divine had intended to make a film that was at once an act of doubt and an act of faith in the novel he was the priest was shown profaning an image of and yet the act was an act of faith the train slid past the mountains turned the pages this novel spoke to him all at once he saw it as a picture he would like to make the novel was by a convert steeped in literature and the history of catholicism in japan published in japan in sold 800 , 000 a huge number in that country was called graham and was considered for the prize referred to as of the finest novels of our the missionary brought catholicism to japan in 1549 in the next it was suppressed through the torture of missionaries and their who were forced to apostatize by stepping on the a piece of copper impressed with an image of in took the point of casting much of the novel in the form of letters by reporting back to his superior he goes to japan with another young vowing to seek the truth about their father but they are captured and shown the reality of human suffering under torture the shogunate invites the converts to avoid torture by stepping on the many some are tortured anyway sees converts burned drowned a magistrate fluent in makes a grim can save the lives of the converts under torture if only he will step on the and apostatize when returned from he procured the film rights to as the years hardly a day went by without his mentioning the project to the people around friends and even his old parish father as he made and and he insisted that was the picture he really wanted to make a was elected terrorists began targeting in the middle east in with wolf of wall a declared that would be his next he commit to another until it was finished years filming began what led this great artist to make a story of missionaries in japan his ultimate passion he is known for his gangster he is a grandmaster of the profane from the he has revealed himself to be an artist of intensely catholic and the poisoned arrow of religious conflict runs straight through his career a vet as a spiritual bent on cleansing the city of filth through violence a tattooed fundamentalist determined to exact justice a young man raised to be a spiritual thrust up against communism even in the material documentary about takes as its theme the conflict between flesh and between and seeker is a novel for our it in the missionary so many of the religious matters that vex us in the present the claims to universal truths in diverse the conflict between a profession of faith and the expression of and the seeming silence of god while believers are drawn into violence on his behalf as material for is and yet commitment to it has been even by his exacting standards to understand that i spoke with the with members of the cast and the production team and with others who know the novel well trying to grasp just what kind of an act of faith this film is know if but there is such a thing as trying to get it said to in the new voice familiar from the cameos in his movies how do you do the right way to live has to do with selflessness i believe that but how does one act that i think you practice it consciously it has to be something that develops in you maybe through a lot of he had invited me to his east side townhouse at 9 having spent a full day editing in midtown the living is decorated with a vintage movie posters for jean grand and photographs of his wife and daughter he is compact and with tremendous life in his eyes and a youthful ardor that seems to have its source in reverence for his elders like the polish filmmaker who had signed a storyboard that unhooked from the wall to show me we took and he began to talk as the hours the already seemed to diminish around until it resembled a screening or a a place where questions of how to live are posed through stories and images goes back to what father was telling me the last time i saw a couple of years he said doing something that is morally that is a great sin many people will never come back from that but the way would be to get up and try again maybe not but you get yourself into a situation where you can make another choice and the situation is he can choose to save the lives of others by renouncing his the act he considers most reprehensible of all no less than informal new trilogy is rooted in his childhood as a boy in little he wanted to be a missionary his parents were not in part because their parents had felt the heavy hand in but for him the church a malign force in so many stories was a portal to the world beyond family and neighborhood trusted the because it made what they what they he said understood that another way to outside the tough world i grew up the pointed to the wider world his a presser in the garment make much but always had enough money to take him to the movies a local station broadcast films on nights he grew up watching the crucial works of many of them with a strong catholic dimension like open in which a priest is executed for cooperating with the resistance the catholicism of the area was centered on street processions devoted to saints brought over from the old for the on for the on mulberry street i was it was already dying told me it hooked him even so the vaulted interior of st old cathedral on street was a sharp contrast to the small the mass a formal counterpoint to their mealtime banter think i move and i think it has something to do

illumination through carnal knowledge read the novel in the after it was given to him by and the two stars of by the time he set to making a movie it was the and the novel was again seen as a challenge to conservative then at full volume stated aims for the picture were straightforward he wanted to give the gospel story a contemporary the way great artists like had done and he wanted to fulfill his childhood vision and take the biblical epic to a different place but the project soon turned complicated beyond belief after committing to the picture in paramount pictures began to have

persecution of often to the point of martyrdom is real and continuing since the sept 11 the word has taken on awful new connotations is inadvertently topical like the the picture interrogates the very idea of by proposing that there are instances when martyrdom the believer holding fast to to the bitter end is not holy or even right it makes in the way of art the arguments made in defense of that

question is are we allowed to do an essentially evil act to obtain a good if it is done to save then the answer is no but the novel is so complex because he does it for his for the good end of saving his flock he will go to hell but he will go to hell for their tramples on the because his intention is right to save the lives of others the act seems right and because it entails the sacrifice of his exalted sense of it seems a a loss of self for sake the novel work through theological questions so scholastically it enfolds them within other whether missionary activity is ipso facto a form of and whether the content of a religious faith is lost in translation when it is promulgated in a new language in a new land should the church adapt to particular or should it maintain an approach distinctively its in that is a question of since the council of when the by clashed over whether new should be held to law the history of has turned on questions of the brilliance of is that it shows how these questions increase and multiply the young seem to favor adopting peasant taking the sacraments directly to the people and calling their hut a magistrate a figure akin to grand inquisitor tells that cannot take root in the that is japan when finally meets concurs the they are breakaway the apostate priest they worship the of not the son of god those dying upside down in the they die for he tells they died for you for all is itself a complex act of a featuring a point of that could not have been written by anyone but a the is an expression of a point developed in a new book by the artist it is an image of god devised by the shogunate for the purpose of but over the course of the it becomes an authentic image of under the converts abuse it they renounce their faith but that mean they stop believing they keep in mysterious ways own body of work is a strong argument for in that he instinctively finds religious patterns and images in dispirited society his is an act of cultural adaptation would call it to the third here an catholic adapts a novel about catholics for a movie arguably most distinctive art form and yet suggests that of the usual kind is impossible it makes vivid the idea that the act called apostasy can be a shrewd adaptation of religious faith to a hostile and that faith maintained in spite of a outward acts of apostasy is faith nonetheless the question the novel comes down is you a this posed by to the peasant is one that must answer for himself before he approaches the and long after he tramples on it it is a question that cannot be answered for the believer by the or a or society the novel is not about a struggle with a hostile culture when the magistrate says as denies no unconsciously the priest raised his voice as he spoke struggle was with in my own before it opens in new and in will be screened in for several hundred and for at the no stretch to suppose that pope a will find a way to be there assuredly will be and

on a sultry evening in late the authorities executed their very first assault on what they called the financial cupola of or the largest of the ruthless gangs that have made el the murder capital of the world until that the national civil police had followed an almost choreographed again and as they sought to cripple the gangs economically in the dead of often accompanied by television officers would batter down the doors of ramshackle houses in marginalized communities and then arrest and put on display a cluster of tattooed and men between 2012 and the total amount confiscated in these showy raids was an absurdly tiny sum considering that the united states has designated as a global criminal organization on a par with the zetas of or the of japan on in a mission baptized operation the authorities shifted gears they deployed 1 , 127 police officers to raid scores of supposed gang including car dealerships and motels and brothels with great they presented to the news media rows and rows of impounded buses and along with 77 suspects identified as the financial operatives of and their collaborators among them were the supposed of the street and two other leaders portrayed as controlling millions and possessing luxuries unimaginable to the destitute gang members beneath them but the presentation was something of an as are many official characterizations of the gangs whose criminal sophistication and global reach tend to be overstated by authorities frustrated that they cannot vanquish them for that supposed chief executive officer hardly lived like a he leased a squat concrete house with a corrugated roof in a neighborhood where rents rarely reach he owned an old civic and a van in collaboration with the new el a digital newspaper based in sought to pierce the secrecy surrounding the finances of the gangs that terrorize el which is experiencing a level of deadly violence unparalleled outside war 103 homicides per 100 , 000 residents last compared with five

member would earn a week and about a month that is half the minimum wage of an agricultural day laborer but the gangs and its main the 18th street gang do not distribute their proceeds equitably they use them to pay for lawyers and funeral for weapons and and for the support of those serving long prison terms and their families theirs is a criminal subsistence even many of their leaders are barely solvent the authorities call them either their intelligence is invalid or pretty said a former prosecutor who oversaw investigations until 2013 gangs are like an anthill they are all after the same something to unlike other groups considered global organized crime the gangs do not survive on the international trafficking of arms and humans while they dabble in drug gun sales and they engage primarily in a single crime committed over and over within extortion inside el they hold the reins of power largely because of a chilling demand repeated or implied daily across the pay or die the thing is not joking said one threat in childlike handwriting delivered to a bus owner recently something together if we are going to burn one of your new it was signed by the 18th street sends its at 4 on a summer day in two young gang members intercepted a businessman as he was returning home from work have kids calm he managed to say before the youths grabbed threw him to the ground and shot in a in the and twice in the face they were delivering a message written in lead was because of the not for any other the son said the man owned a bus his who also owned a said his tired of being had finally stopped making his daily payment to the gang three weeks before his death it murdered him because of among transportation whose vehicles crisscross gang have proved especially vulnerable to extortion over the last five it has been more dangerous to drive a bus than to fight gang the gangs have killed 692 transportation workers and 93 police officers is according to an analysis of internal government data like most data in this is not considered public information but was obtained by el the owner of a large bus company and a former member of calculates that he has handed over in gang extortion payments over the last 19 years a matter of he said they tell you they are going to kill you have a between 2013 and the national police received 7 , 506 reports of which the authorities see as just a small fraction of the total in the same some 424 gang members were convicted of this most of them people who made the pickups and were caught with the cash the payment of extortion by bus companies is so commonplace that some have employees whose principal role is to negotiate with the which are continually raising their rates and demanding extras like bonuses or buses to take them to the beach or to the funerals of associates the only transportation company chief who has refused to be extorted and has made his refusal public is owns a fleet of several hundred buses since the gangs have killed 26 of his employees but he refuses to reconsider his position i told one of he referring to a gang ahead and kill them this cannot continue for a spoke in his with a pistol lying atop a mess of papers on his and rifles and flak jackets piled in a corner he spends a month on he said he has cameras posted in all his buses and and eight security armed with assault who patrol the gang zones his buses move through when his employees are he hires private detectives to because state does not have the capacity to protect use they abandon resisting the gangs is not an option for however many of them live in neighborhoods themselves and cannot escape the pressure to pay that was the situation for the bus owner killed in the summer of 2015 the bus who is spoke of his death in an restaurant beside the highway the son carried a pistol he always has one by his even when he he said and sat facing the with his back to a so he could track comings and goings like most businessmen who recounted their experiences with the man spoke on the condition of anonymity his father was one of 154 transportation workers who lost their lives to extortion rings in 2015 to talk is to risk becoming another statistic it all started one afternoon in he when a couple of teenage gangsters boarded a bus on their route the youths demanded the license and reviewed the documents and then handed the driver a disposable phone before jumping off after the shaken driver returned to the the phone rang the voice on the other end laid out the terms of their new a week not just for the one bus but for each of the 10 buses on the route the his father and the other bus owners held an emergency meeting to discuss whether to report the demand to the police many victims do not bother extortion investigations require them to make payments to the gangs while the police watch and collect evidence but the gangs almost always find and the victim is threatened or killed before the investigation is completed even the men decided to call the police two detectives stationed themselves inside their terminal posing as bus negotiated a rate with the a day per bus over the next three

platform at a regardless of the most parents insist on knowing passwords and logins until he was were that i get all the passwords to all accounts i did spot check from time to have all and and if they she has to update my list if i try to log on and i get the phone until it pleases me to give it do parents actually monitor their some do read texts are or all of his social media so we see every have asked to read texts when daughter was hiding device as i came into the do random audits we talk about digital citizenship and positive but others prefer to give their children freedom they each began i read random texts and i asked about the ones i read see you and friend are chatting about the or see you and friend are chatting about another child in that way they know i can read any text at any even though i almost all very punishments what happens if children violate the family is it actually possible to separate a digital native from a device for an extended period of skeptical many parents say yes when she responds to the ultimate weeping and gnashing of and then they find other things to have he gets very angry initially but eventually he calms down last spring i implemented a 3 week digital cleanse he was angry each day for 3 days but also became more another common way to get children to adhere to restrictions is to have them pay for overages pay the fee but have her pay also cut data now babysits family friends to earn more and has to learn basic family time perhaps the biggest complaint about technology is that it eats into family time so what techniques have parents used to take back that dining devices for all phones at the and not just at our house nephews and my home have the same rule no one gripes about they just do devices at meals no in the consider positive alternatives things that make phones a burden playing a attending concerts or watch movies have a fire in the yard or swim when warm and have game only board games allowed they used to but have found favorite games and look forward to it something constructive together make sure everyone mommy and get their hands dirty we often will cook together and make some of the worst meals but because we did it when all else many rely on the old parental bribes and public humiliation i that phone out of your it limits their use for the next five date night alternate taking one child out for a fourth week is parents night public a device is picked up during family we get to open and my husband and i do dramatic text now a technique even the parents of river city might embrace these trouble may start with the but the solution still begins at home

something is deeply wrong when the reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as fantasy news to claim that he has endorsed a presidential and then be through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright because they are easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people when might call their work or admit that in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be and that is and maybe to deal with for many and especially opponents of j the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president talked passionately about it on it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every and is at risk of being not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on websites were prevalent in this election were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright image posted by individuals and shared by and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan page operators for a magazine article this it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional it contained much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a posted on a website and promoted on a page copied from another site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on the father of a slain who had spoken out against j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a sinister its insinuating mention of in proximity to mentions of and its misleading and strategic mention of amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this clearly designed to function well within economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up as a broad media offensive especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of and by the candidate himself as the campaign criticism of trump was instantly projected back at his or at the critics themselves puppet no puppet the this tactic was used on the language of social which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new but it was newly effective it matter that its targets knew that it was a a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they but realized that nobody could make them listen as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news as widely understood and has already begun to encompass not just fabricated but a wider swath of traditional media on and elsewhere fox fake news misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in fake news the entirety of fake news this wide formulation of will be applied back to the traditional news which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things even when they are may try to address the narrow version of the the clearly fabricated posts has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside anyway another narrow response from could be to assert editorial control over external forces tried to a very limited with trending topics members of the editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a upon reaching some high threshold of or a upon reaching some cumulative could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the for example but where would that leave the rest of the answered and and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a news environment in which almost everything there before remained the main difference being that it would have all been not fake is a place where people construct and project identities to family and peers it is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities it is a system built on ranking and vetting and and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely and where conflict is resolved with isolation that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy for it has been a source of constant fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the economy more than most of the organizations that are identifying them their removal will be an improvement the outrage at their mere and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the will have been justified but the outrage is at risk of being and will be followed by the realization that the colloquial the amateur and for which truth is defined first in personal and political and which must only meet the bar of not being demonstrably false will continue growing gaining authority by sheer not despite but because of it the company that created the system that resulted in hoax news stories should try to eliminate and with any luck it will but the system stands to remain intact media companies have spent years looking to waiting for the company to present a solution to their mounting business concerns or perhaps because its being credited with causing those concerns some have come to the realization that this was even absurd those who expect the operator of the dominant media ecosystem of our in response to getting caught promoting to suddenly return authority to the companies it has superseded are in for a similar surprise

a century almost all black lived in the largely in rural areas by most lived outside the a great many in northern and western industrial cities in by hopes for greater economic millions of black migrants made this move did they find what they were looking in yes black workers in the north and in addition to experiencing greater social and political made much more money than did their counterparts in the south but there were also disappointments black migration to industrial cities was not met with steadily growing economic equality between black and white workers from 1940 to the earnings gap between the two groups in the north was virtually and as migration so did black residential isolation exacerbated by to the suburbs and economic stagnation by seven out of 10 black in northern and western cities resided in which were often beset by high levels of poverty and crime scholars in the early part of the 20th century had predicted migration would do more for black than it did what in her rich and technical account competition in the promised black migrants in northern cities and labor markets the economist employs the tools of her trade resourceful matching of data rigorous modeling of labor sweeping use of census figures to analyze the demographics and economics of the great migration as a whole more traditional often focusing on a single city a couple of and relying on less nationally representative sources like oral histories and newspaper have not typically done this does not aim to overturn the conventional explanation for sluggish black economic growth in the the decline of manufacturing and the persistence of racism in labor and housing markets but as with many other aspects of the migration her investigation both deepens our understanding of what we think we know and adds new complexities and wrinkles for as the title of her book is interested in whether black economic progress in the north was hamstrung by labor competition between and black workers fear voiced as early as 1923 by she finds that between 1940 and 1970 years of heaviest such competition did indeed lower wages for black men in the north by billion a year 2010 or 10 percent of their median earnings absent such she black workers already living in the north would have closed more of the earnings gap with white workers she that this finding does not let racism the black workers were competing with one as opposed to with white sometimes because of discriminatory hiring practices that excluded blacks from jobs for which they were qualified and sometimes suggests even more because they were genuinely less qualified than similarly trained white workers on account of the lower quality of their schooling a reflection of racial as for the poor black urban neighborhoods that arose in the wake of the great many of which are still characterized by various forms of what should be in his provocative book dark and reform the philosopher tackles this question but he lay out a jobs program or a housing initiative as he freely he offers new political strategies or policy what he aims to do instead is both more abstract and more to challenge the common to liberals and conservatives that ghettos are best addressed with narrowly targeted government programs or civic interventions for ghettos are something more troubling and less symptoms of the of the united states they represent not aberrant dysfunction but the natural workings of a deeply unfair scheme the only real in this way of is the reform of the basic structure of our this proposal may sound too ambitious to be of much relevance to everyday debates about how to help struggling urban neighborhoods is asking for no less than an overhaul of our major economic and social institutions along the lines of those of a progressive even if you agree that the ghetto poor are not merely disadvantaged but unjustly you may still deem it wiser to focus on more immediate measures but here is where argument becomes more he contends that the injustice of ghettos places certain moral constraints on what the government may do to try to improve them in his for the state may not justifiably require people to work in order to receive welfare benefits the injustice of ghettos relaxes certain moral on the behavior of the ghetto some of whose otherwise blameworthy and punishable actions as he sees sound expressions of and legitimate resistance to an oppressive status quo cites welfare fraud and tax evasion as at the heart of these arguments is a simple reciprocity in a just you receive your fair share and contribute your fair share but if you are born into a ghetto with its social its poor its its high levels of drug use and incarceration in what have you received your fair your equitable shot at and if society has not held up its end of the the least it can when trying to patch things is respect the autonomy and of those it aims to help a poor single woman in a ghetto may not have the resources to be an ideal is willing to but if that is ultimately a shortcoming of our it adds insult to injury to structure welfare benefits has been done in the united so as to discourage childbearing thereby hindering her reproductive freedom does not deny that high jobless rates in ghettos are a problem but if some of the ghetto poor choose not to he maybe that is because they to accommodate to their place in a social order where it is possible to work full time and still live in poverty this he may not be the most basis of or the purest ethic of resistance but at least something he something that will serve to make the ghetto poor active allies in a collective effort at fundamental change in the united states is a welfare program that mandates work justified in taking even this another way of stating position is that even you were to grant a of argument that disrespect of homes and reluctance to work are helping to perpetuate or worsen ghetto conditions he would still oppose government efforts to coerce out of respect for the dignity and political however of the wrongly oppressed though draws on the writings of such canonical liberal thinkers as john in key respects it echoes a more radical the black panther platform and drafted by p newton and bobby in which also conceived the problem of the ghetto as one not merely of poverty and but also of more systemic criminal justice and heath care injustices in the revolution has black and the black panther party in her detailed organizational history of the the historian c reminds us that for the

the united states is a leader in technology but it may well be a laggard when it comes to using technology for political mischief the role that fake news stories on sites in particular played in last presidential election continues to be a issue did fake news tip the balance in the can do more to prevent fake should executives dispute the notion that fake news on the social network might have swayed voters but political analysts say the warning signs of this debate could be seen in other countries years ago take the where a spokesman for its shared on an image of a girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer checkers later revealed that the photo had come from and mark write the role of fake news posted to in the recent presidential election is likely to be debated for even years but there is little doubt that the social media network has had plenty of influence in a reminder to register to vote contributed to significant increases in voter registration across the according to officials in nine states in that did not dispute their conclusion

unpredictable as casement himself whereas used his imprisonment as a frame for an overview of his the author of several other novels and the story collection widens the narrative landscape by giving

homosexual subculture of the late 19th century but an allegiance to the cause that baffles whose obliviousness to feelings for him goes hand in hand with his john bullish denigration of which he sees

interesting juxtaposition of the the show announces that the current season will be its and who creates fake news stories on the tells the sites were picked up by trump supporters all the time i think trump is in the white house because of the reality show about the family of and its became a spectacular hit for after its debut in march then a spectacular headache in late 2013 when the made remarks in a interview that were widely seen as offensive to gay people at that point the show was averaging nine million viewers a an amazing number for a reality but the controversy cost it cachet among some and ratings have fallen considerably since overexposure no doubt also played a role in the decline members of the clan became celebrities and started turning up all over the and the producers churned out too many episodes too quickly even viewers who still loved the and their homespun antics may have been tiring of the whole premise during season 11 the family announced that the series would end with the finale in bother making a joke about the shelving the series so they could join j administration social media was flooded with them by morning that could happen there are certainly enough to fill every cabinet and the central was a supporter of trump but this is more likely just an example of a show that has run out of gas not without leaving a however the series helped solidify the idea that distinguishing between real and truth and really important i spent a day with the in west in the summer of between the first and second seasons the series was still building but even at that early the readily acknowledged that their real at all hardly rare most reality shows are staged or at least steered toward a preplanned of course but the were unusual in that they freely admitted it is the phrase they used the episodes simply follow the around in their daily the producers would often sketch out the parameters of a situation and have the family live it what made the show work so well was that the fitting the eastern image of were in fact savvy media excellent improvisers and telegenic as heck and they seemed to intuit that although many of the episodes were obvious no one would care sensed that viewers would happily embrace the reality that they even if it was a manipulated or outright invented version of reality and in we have seen this flexible definition of real carry into the political arena as horner fabricated news articles streamed into receptive minds through feeds and such were a worrisome phenomenon in the presidential and they continue to be being called this was named oxford 2016 international word of the politicians have only recently figured out how to exploit it the and other dynasties have been doing it for years

lurking behind the turmoil and the jockeying for advantage in j effort to assemble a national security team lies the more fundamental question of how he will address the immediate and complex challenges he inherits upon taking office trump has never articulated any detailed foreign policy vision beyond the vague slogan the diverse and shifting cast of potential appointees under consideration for top administration jobs has only highlighted the deep splits among conservatives about how the new administration should confront threats involving north and among and how it should manage relations with allies in and trump said in a march interview with the new describing for the first time what the phrase meant to him have been mocked and ripped off for many years by people that were from his personnel appointments to his first major meeting with a foreign leader it came in new with prime minister of japan trump faces a series of decisions that will begin to flesh out his approach to the world and provide some clue as to how he might respond to whatever crises confront him as commander in chief does mean he will use military and to wipe out emerging from rogue nuclear states to terrorist before they can do harm to the united or does it mean he calls troops back building them into a retaliatory force that can lash out if the nation is at moments during the he suggested both approaches he said he would the from areas of and he criticized president for pulling troops out too soon but he is also the man who rejected and is it always the united states that gets right in the middle of he some we cannot be the policeman of the no one knows what response to expect from a man who said he prided himself on following his instincts and has little patience for careful legalisms of his predecessor but while presidents the challenges do not here are some places and issues where will first take trump called the agreement reached with in intended to constrain from building nuclear of the most incompetent deals of any kind ever and he promised to fix it because the deal is an executive not a the new president has great latitude to alter or scrap it but two can play that the are deeply unhappy with the arguing that they never got the relief from sanctions that they were promised any effort to reopen the bargaining will also give military officers and conservatives a chance to alter the pact or threaten to resume their race for nuclear capability to the deal was not only but also badly negotiated he said of secretary of state john and his negotiating team trump said he would have left the negotiating doubled down on and never agreed to give back billions of money that belonged to and was frozen in financial institutions but when he struggled to name any part of the deal he would have walked out of the negotiations to alter with some he finally settled on a common that after 15 will be free to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium in any quantity in decision about what to do with the deal will be an early test of his willingness to act unilaterally the nations that joined the united states in the negotiations and china not only support the but are rushing to take economic advantage of it by building commercial ties with if trump wanted to abandon the deal or reimpose they would almost certainly refuse to go along the hold a few too in they shipped 98 percent of their nuclear fuel out of the disabled a plutonium reactor and took thousands of which enrich out of service if the deal were to be declared they would be free to their nuclear infrastructure and rebuild their now frozen until 2030 by administration it would take about a year for them to produce enough new material for a weapon longer to produce the weapon itself one option for advocated by many is to simply reimpose sanctions on for including its activities in and its continued support of terrorism the would say that violates the spirit of the agreement and leadership has already threatened that such action would nullify it it is hard to say which has sounded more confrontational in recent years about north the which has regularly warned of a to any north use of its expanding nuclear or the who spent much of the bush years plotting ways to make the regime collapse but if there is likely to be an early test of reaction to north is probably it the nation has accelerated its nuclear and its arsenal is it could have 20 to 50 weapons during term in his security trump will be hearing the latest estimates for how long it will take the north to build a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the public figure is five years or though some intelligence officials believe it could happen significantly sooner trump has at various times described north young as even while expressing grudging admiration for toughness so the early choice will be should trump confront the north with more missile defenses and perhaps a naval blockade to stop all trade that does not go across the perhaps that is what trump meant when he said that should use our economic power to have them should he reopen negotiations with a nation that has made clear that its nuclear arsenal is perhaps that is what trump was suggesting when he said he was willing to meet one on one with over a hamburger as yet another should he pull back forces in the pacific and let the and the deal with the he suggested just that in a interview with the new saying that if countries did not pay their fair share for he was prepared to tell you will be defending trump made before and after the that he was determined to reverse policy in and perhaps elsewhere in the middle east at the core of his approach is an argument that the only interest in the region is to fight the also known as or a position vigorously endorsed by w the onetime new city mayor who was seen as a leading candidate for secretary of state to ramp that trump argued again last week that the united states should ally itself with and the government of president five years after declared that must leave office said he was cautiously optimistic that trump could be a in battling terrorism if trump follows through on his campaign it would essentially mean aligning the united states with a man now believed to have presided over the killing of more than 470 , 000 of his own citizens not saying is a good trump said in our far greater problem is not how trump changes course on and particularly on will be watched closely by other authoritarians around the world chief among president of another strongman who is imprisoning or while seeking more military and the royal about whom trump has been deeply critical three of the leading candidates for top national security jobs in the new administration john r and senator sessions of have all been reflexively critical of v the leader when annexed in sessions said must feel for because if it did could feel free to forward to take all of in has said that in his the united states was more concerned about seizure of territory in than its neighbors were he has at times hinted that he might seek to end sanctions against trump has also suggested that the time has come for a of policy that would essentially seek a series of partnerships with he has never indicated how he would react for tested him by seizing more especially in countries the debate over containing or joining up with it may be one of the most crucial in the early days of a trump presidency states will be looking for reassurance that talk about pulling back from commitments was campaign not policy meeting leaders this is repeating the familiar reassurances about the commitment to but his assurances will mean several diplomats have noted in recent since he also assured his counterparts that trump would not get elected

am i ford bleated out while ambling around his valley talking on the phone to a reporter though the director of groundbreaking films such as and rarely gives interviews ones where actual blood is not he was doing so on this morning a few weeks ago to promote godfather the nifty document of film history basically takes all of jottings in the margins of the original novel as well as his actual screenplay from the first installment of the trilogy and turns them into a holiday season coffee table book it has just been published by arts the book shows how he brought 1969 novel to life in a film that would go on to win the academy award for best picture in excising whole portions of the story and highlighting what he believed was a flawed a narrative of capitalism in as seen through the spilled blood and guts of one family but for a the topic was blood his own a he explaining that he had been watching a sports went to grab the remote and then knocked over the glass the cut so bad he felt he save for the fact that he was and knew there might be consequences if the blood ended up on anything valuable wife will kill said so he put the phone went off to dress his wound and then returned for an worth of questions about the movie he would sort of like to the career mostly left behind and the empire subsequently built he made it clear that the book was a fairly venture that he did largely because people around him told him it was time he carped about his publisher amount of work that company made me said who has an unusual ability to turn complaining into a joyous experience could get that from a speaking engagement and constant i have to do this i have to do that i have to write the as well as do this interview well what else was there to do but make the best of interview has been edited and when was the last time you watched i years ago for the memory of brings great unhappiness that movie took 60 and it was not to mention the months after of jockeying over the cut so my reaction is usually of panic and but that has nothing to do with how it is for the audience something i liked about reading your book was finding out how methodical you were a presumption that all great art is the result of a boundless imagination this book shows that a slog it was insecurity i was so young i was hired because i was young a lot of important directors turned it down turned it down turned it a whole bunch of important directors so the philosophy get someone who could presumably be pushed around i was and that was because it meant if the studio got flak they could simply it was an and i was someone they could get for a good cheap price how much were you they offered me two either and 10 percent of the or and 6 percent of the profits i had two kids and a third one on the so i took 125 and 6 percent i think i asked for 7 percent and get it when the movie was did you immediately know what a hit it i bob the kept it really close to the vest he shown it to anyone and i had been so heard i was going to be that they were going to send in an action director i was there was some happiness on set has written that she fell in love with making the film in the she indicated he was her but paramount want him i set up an where i took a room at the st hotel and i had them order room service then i left them alone and i went and sure that was the incubation but tricky it can backfire if they break up right during the film happened to too do tell i say another movie i imagine godfather part was easier part ii was a joy i had total control throughout all did you read your i learned not but i did then i remember when i did frank rich said there had not been so big a disaster in years had just come out i was about a guy in a suit flying and saying is the biggest and worst what was the most widespread criticism about of the that it was violent and romanticized those guys do you think it in yes because the acting ultimately made those people even though their behavior was so terrible real mafia people are animals with the third the critics really sunk their teeth in the third part was not something i wanted to do i was coming out of a bankruptcy today the founder of a very successful wine business you direct movies as regularly people ask me do you like i no both very but the cinema remains the most magical thing which is why so heartbreaking to see happening to it if it for this sliver of independent there would be nothing left doing a movie of more than million on an interesting topic today is nearly impossible i sometimes i leave the the cinema went off in its own direction the great studios who produced such great films along with great entertainment have now been bought up by companies so i guess you were not pleased to learn that was purchasing time warner i do not think it will pass the regulations are there movies you liked actually i loved army totally imaginative i liked by was beautiful so full of life and humor there is now many would argue the advent of and amazon in relation sort of make up for the decline of the movie studio yes cinema and television are becoming the same thing you say i do this for television or movies they both can be shown in theaters or at home it can be one minute or a hundred and you can have a screen big and beautiful like the lg which are a miracle i noticed recently that you endorsed those do you have a deal with i kept buying so they you make a statement about how much you like give you some and i said because i already ordered

periodically you know this by now creating strong passwords and never using the same password across sites is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion not everyone agrees about frequent password changes most say you should use really strong passwords and no more than one password per then use the password managers but making up new combinations all the time is irritating and tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple that is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes far better to create really strong ones for every login and new passwords can pose security because hard to remember complex so you are tempted to write them down that can lead to a lot of passwords to keep track of recommends password which help store

as the technology industry came to grips in the last week with the reality of a presidential election that did not go its many in silicon valley landed on the idea that widespread misinformation spread was a primary factor in the outcome on both and altered their advertising policies to explicitly prohibit sites that traffic in fake news from making money off lies very likely a worthwhile even if it comes too late the has loosened our collective grasp on the and efforts to fight that dismaying trend are obviously worth pursuing yet it would be a mistake to end this investigation at fake news in the dangers posed by fake news are just a symptom of a deeper truth now dawning on the with billions of people glued to and other popular social media has become an increasingly powerful cultural and political to the point that its effects are now beginning to alter the course of global events the election of j trump is perhaps the starkest illustration yet that across the social networks are helping to fundamentally rewire human society they have subsumed and gutted mainstream media they have undone traditional political advantages like and access to advertising and they are destabilizing and replacing institutions and established ways of doing including political transnational organizations and unspoken social prohibitions against blatant expressions of racism and xenophobia most because these services allow people to communicate with one another more they are helping to create surprisingly influential social organizations among groups these ad hoc social movements range widely in from white supremacists in the united states to in to in the middle east to the hacker collectives of eastern and but each in its own way is now wielding previously unthinkable resulting in sometimes destabilizing geopolitical spasms now have billions of people on the and most of them are not that happy with the status said the president of the a research firm that forecasts global risks think their local government is authoritarian they think on the wrong side of the establishment aggrieved by identity politics and a middle many factors accounted for economic anxiety in the industrial an inchoate desire for some kind of change in the national and some mix of latent xenophobia and sexism across the electorate but as even trump acknowledged in an interview with aired social media played a determining role in the race in the the concerns of supporters might have been and his candidacy would almost certainly have foundered after he was universally written off by just about every mainstream and he faced disadvantages in organization and access to traditional political expertise yet by putting out a message that resonated with people trump hacked through every established political order this new people are now empowered to express their grievances and to follow people they see as echoing their said it for social i see trump for people who like an predictable this is the scariest thing about not that it may be full of lies problem that could potentially be but that its scope gives it real power to change history in unpredictable ways but where we are time to start recognizing that social networks actually are becoming the forces that their boosters long promised they would be and to be rather than by the huge social changes they could uncork this should come as no surprise in a we are now living through a kind of version of the utopia that some in tech once envisioned would be unleashed by social media over much of the last we have seen progressive social movements powered by the web spring up across the world there was the green revolution in and the spring in the middle east and north in the united we saw the occupy wall street movement and the protests social networks also played a role in electoral politics first in the ultimately unsuccessful candidacy of dean in and then in the election of the first president in 2008 yet now those movements look like the prelude to a crackup in the global order in this organizing on played a major role in the push to get the country to leave the union in the a firebrand mayor who was vastly outspent by managed to marshal a huge army of supporters to help him win the presidency the state has used social networks to recruit from around the world to fight in and as well as to inspire terrorist attacks overseas and in the united both a socialist who ran for president as a and who was once reviled by most members of the party he now relied on movements to shatter the political status quo why is this all happening clay a professor at new university who has studied the effects of social suggested a few reasons one is the ubiquity of which has reached a truly epic scale last month the company reported that about 1 8 billion people now log on to the service every month because social networks feed off the various permutations of interactions among they become strikingly more powerful as they grow with about a quarter of the population now on the possibilities are staggering the technology gets when the crazy social effects get said one of those social effects is what calls the of the a term coined by the researcher p to describe the range of subjects that the mainstream media deems publicly acceptable to discuss from about the early until the very recent it was usually considered unwise for politicians to court views deemed by most of society to be out of the things like overt calls to racial bias were of like the but the shifted that window was kept at bay because of pluralistic said person who was sitting in their basement yelling at the about immigrants or was willing to say white were more than other kinds of they know how many others shared their thanks to the now each person with views can see that not alone and when these people find one they can do things create publications and entire worlds that bolster their and then break into the mainstream the groups also become ready targets for political figures like who recognize their energy and enthusiasm and tap into it for victories notes that the window just shifting on the right we see it happening on the too sanders campaigned on an street platform that would have been unthinkable for a democrat just a decade ago after the way forward for democrats will very likely be determined as much by collectives on as by elites in as a likely to see more unlikely candidates and policy positions than we would have in the past the upshot is further unforeseen events absolutely going to get more of these insurgent and more crazy social said trump is just the tip of the iceberg prepare for interesting times
it would be easy to miss the mosque in a temporary building with a concrete floor and corrugated roof but it is impossible to miss the constellation of six loudspeakers atop a giant metal structure

the tension over the loudspeakers was easy to detect in a visit to a clothes and jewelry market a few blocks away several shoppers and salespeople said that they did not mind the call during daylight

morning peak travel flow it the liberal democrats leader the seventh time he had struck out for the famously handsome suburban town since his party picked a candidate to try to boot the famously handsome goldsmith out of his famously handsome park parliamentary sense is that expansion of the big thing that everyone talked about in the first went on he had a of course the is only happening because goldsmith chose to keep a promise he made to park electors when challenging the then lib incumbent during the 2010 general election campaign that he if resign and the seat as an independent should a conservative government go back on the promise that had been made by the then shiny new party leader in 2009 that if he became prime minister airport would not be no but goldsmith the only candidate against expansion the lib as a party are too and while appears in despite the reluctance of its its park hopeful is not argued that it is the electorate that has pushed the airport down the pecking order of though given that the running a leaving the case in of expansion unmade in local hustings or media hard to see how it could have gone anywhere else not off the but people seem to

political map is hard to read with certainty as day of 1 nears new bush has written contrary to common there is strong evidence that goldsmith no personal vote worth talking and that any he did have will have been weakened by his stance and that toxic mayoral campaign as bush park contains many of the types of likely to have been turned off by both this seems underlined by taking the share of second preference votes in the mayoral which made his winning margin overwhelming rather than just very large the decision of the local green party to stand aside in of ought to help her too and she has made the calculation that going a bit further than her party over the article 50 vote will be another factor in her she says vote against it regardless of what it says or any promise of a second

on a evening in a mongrel is wandering between the seats in a room above a pausing to sniff handbags for hidden owner of the wee ginger dug is whose popular of that title propelled him into the midst of the that sprang up around the campaign for independence in 2014 as delivers an entertaining disquisition to the roomful of dedicated souls who have braved the wintry one could be forgiven for thinking this was another example of the phenomenon that many argue contributed to the loss of the independence yes supporters talking to here in where locals opted to remain in the by to the narrowest margin in the whole of these activists are all too familiar with the that led many independence supporters to believe that more of the country was of their view in the final giddy weeks before the need more local focus and a more so not caught in the bubble we were last says as the discussion after talk turns to strategy for a second referendum campaign members are far less about independence than their leadership got to be about and giving people the proper insists who heads the group for and the meeting with that in mind feel there are certain on currency for that are going to be asked the next that we have the answers to of independence have never stopped wanting to talk about it to anyone willing to listen so why has a national survey billed by first minister sturgeon herself as biggest listening exercise in our been such a muted barely mentioned at last annual curiously devoid of the usual social media blaring and what does that reveal about the state of the independence as well as those willing to vote for the the most significant mass of the hugely expanded membership since the first independence sturgeon challenged activists to reach everyone living in in 90 days through doorstep discussions and town hall meetings launching it at the beginning of the leader argued that the changed circumstances brought about by the vote justified a new debate on the 300 , 000 people responded within the first though it would be fascinating to know how many of those had previously voted against independence not one suspects the conservatives and never tire of pointing out that no voters would be far happier if their decision on 18 were taken as their final answer local branches attest to many hundreds more survey leaflets notably devoid of heavy branding being across the country by an indefatigable core of activists which remains the envy of every other political final results which the does not intend to share publicly may well provide party with useful not least about the third of supporters who voted for and how many of them are likely to support the ultimate preference for independence in it is difficult not to conclude that the which ends on st 30 has been something of a fools errand for those loyal they are the first to admit that the exercise has drawn a mixed with many refusing to speak to them at all those most willing to they are previous no voters whose position has changed since but polls suggest that only around a tenth of those who opposed independence in 2014 have switched and almost as many have moved in the opposite anecdotal findings only reinforce the sense that prediction on the morning following the referendum result that a second independence poll was was made in haste not least if by she meant they reflect a broader after two referendums and two national elections within 18 voters have minimal appetite for further upheaval latest polling found limited backing for a second independence referendum before the leaves the at with the projected results almost identical to last time voting against independence and in these are the unyielding numbers staring down sturgeon as she weighs up when and whether to call a second did she hope to achieve with beyond busying the troops for a few short cynics would say just the idea was first announced at the spring well before as the leadership sought to quell calls for a speedy second referendum several senior advisers have since acknowledged that the throwaway notion had not been expected to receive such a positive response from members and independence activists not though very the same the membership grew like after her eat me there was much glee from some quarters about how the would cope with this rabble of and conspiracy madly straining at their reins towards a second and there has been a tendency ever since to treat them like toddlers in need of constant has forgotten how to fight for social justice read the majority of new rather like the have revealed themselves to be profoundly just like those activists in they have been waiting patiently to dissect the failures of the 2014 campaign in a formal party setting some warned when the survey was announced that any initiative focused on the of who voted to remain within the would undermine the far more pressing internal it is axiomatic that members want they are far less than their leadership fears when veterans of independence movement staged an alternative fringe festival to run concurrently with the annual conference in last it ended up being complimentary and not the insurgency that some had it did reflect many independence at the way grassroots energy has been into winning elections for the at the lack of consensus or strategy on big questions like the at the failure to establish a forum to dissect and build up the failed arguments of arguments were always loosely divisible into those appealing to heart that bubble mentality now met with such caution by experienced campaigners and those to head perhaps more significant to the than itself has been the political response to it in at a point when the case for independence in the context of plummeting oil and government deficit was looking distinctly xenophobia has been a gift for sturgeon who is once again able to ramp up the emotional appeal of separating from the nastily populist against intolerance and greed is familiar territory for the and it paid significant dividends during the 2015 general election but the situation now is more complicated the party leadership strong fears about unthinking desire for a second now those marched to the top of the hill yet again for the national survey and up to the doorsteps where they have encountered solid no voters might be best placed to

prime announced participation in the program to resettle central refugees from a camp after attending president summit on refugees in from a surprise in at his little attention has been given to the details of this new policy or about the camp itself this is particularly notable with reiterated immigration policy not to settle any illegal maritime arrivals many of the central refugees will have crossed their borders via overland critics might concentrate on whether this announcement was price of entry to the summit or even speculate it is part of a agenda to woo power player it is important to unpack and understand what this new decision means tangibly for the migrants and us in ban on asylum seekers to us says immigration head read what do we know about the camp in what is the humanitarian migration what are they fleeing and after what does this mean for humanitarian program in have been fleeing serious gang violence in the northern triangle of central el and for is the second most dangerous country to live after as gang members target young boys to destroy businesses and abuse girls and women murder rate is the highest in the world at 90 4 homicides per 100 , 000 in according to the office of drugs and crime the average is 6 2 armed gang members are destroying local businesses the police or law enforcement does not deliver criminal justice no rule of law is in proper place highly corrupt governments fail to protect its violence is not strictly covered by the 1951 refugee convention migrants fleeing from gang violence fear their safety back home but they do not face persecution corrupt officials involved in violence can justify the failure to protect their therefore it is indirect state persecution by critics in the us also said granting migrants a refugee status was a redefinition of a refugee but the administration acknowledged the urgency of this humanitarian crisis where innocent children were targeted by gang has detrimental side effects economic and malfunctioning public including hospitals and are indirect consequences of the state failure to guarantee public safety and personal severe droughts have worsened the conditions in central even there was hurricane in 2016 the flows of humanitarian migrants fleeing from poverty and natural disasters are likely to continue and grow women and children are particularly vulnerable unaccompanied minors and mothers with children have been crossing borders to the us and this the administration announced it would work with the and to process refugees from central on top of the

and are being relocated to the us discussions are under way with potential additional transit and destination countries this includes over integration and public main reason central refugees want to go to the us is that the richest country in their region where they already have families and friends to rely on they find and survival tips through these social networks which is an important pull factor for migrants for this even is not easy for them to integrate may be an attractive place for central but far away from their countries of origin across the pacific where they may not necessarily have the networks to support them for smooth transition and successful they need community and businesses to offer jobs for their and successful integration governments alone support newly arriving migrants who may end up relying on government subsidies they need community support and over refugee deal is tough for people who have little resilience left read of raises another serious concern for those across central has been as a pandemic disease by the world health which causes birth defects in babies born to mothers with the virus cases were reported in 20 countries in central including the

downing street has hit back at the institute for fiscal studies after it said workers face the longest period without a increase in wages since the second world war number 10 said these figures were misleading because disposable income figures show that people are getting better off in a separate report the resolution foundation said that family incomes would grow for the rest of the decade but by less than after the financial crisis and not for the poorest who will see their incomes fall it we can look at the outlook for family incomes in the coming and it paints a grim picture our new income forecast brings together lower earnings higher and changes it shows that the rest of this parliament looks set to be as grim as the with incomes growing by an average of 0 2 per cent a compared with 0 5 per cent a year between 2010 11 and 2014 15 while top earners were hit the hardest following the financial the big difference looking forward is that the biggest losers are lower income with the entire bottom third of the income distribution set to see incomes fall in the years ahead could be halted if the people decided the costs of leaving the greatly outweighed any tony has said in an interview marking his return to political the former made more than in a month from giving speeches to us financial and a his register of interests the former conservative health has urged the government to invest more in social care speaking on the world at he said he was that did not address this in his autumn statement the next two years are going to be incredibly difficult and i think the time is now for trying to put some measures in place to try and help health and social care through those next two has called for more money to be spent on social care and mental health speaking ahead of campaign day on he said the campaign had three elements three elements one hospital of waiting times and sustainability and transformation which are putting at risk a lot of departments all around the country the second element is social of social the need to improve social care and improve the way in which we treat care workers very responsible and very well experienced people they should be treated better and paid better there is a mental health crisis across the country i feel very passionately about why i have appointed a shadow minister at cabinet level just for dealing with mental health because i think as a country we have to face up to the crisis fund it but above all change the mood music as well the biggest killer of men is suicide from mental health conditions terrible visiting the hospital in today has reportedly dismissed reports that he plans to emigrate to the us as all from me for for the comments number 10 has hit back at the ifs it says that if you look at disposable not then people are getting better are from hits back at says real household disposable incomes will rise by by ifs looks at wages but better to look at net you look at livings standards they 're at their highest ever ifs figures relate to earnings number 10 is talking about disposable a different measure that includes benefits and and looks at left after tax and national insurance have been paid open the group campaigning to keep in the single has put out a statement from saying the ifs analysis shows that the economic warnings about issued during the referendum campaign were accurate he this is clear proof that the vote has made working families worse off the irresponsibility of leave campaigners was breathtaking they should now be admitting that economic warnings made during the campaign were not project they were project promises that would make better off now appear naive and complacent the conservative former work and pensions told news this afternoon that he did not accept the ifs claim that workers face the longest squeeze on wages for 70 years asked about its he surprised because wages are increasing increasing across the board and well above inflation there was a period when they were absolutely static but over the last two and a half wages been increasing and the forecasts all the way have been that wages will continue to increase so i this dire prediction of no increase at all since the also said that he did not accept the forecasts from bodies like the ifs and the office for budget responsibility about the impact of on the economy my sense about this is that the economy is already confounding the forecasts all the from the ifs and from the and everybody all said that we were going to see a downturn immediately after the vote we seen that the is growing faster than they predicted we just saw the debt fall three days when they predicted it would rise so my sense about this is we are into territory where nobody really knows that the future smith is right about wages growing but he ignores the fact that they fell so in real that they have not caught up with where they were before the crash the resolution foundation makes the point today in this in its autumn statement analysis published this morning average weekly in real terms resolution foundation here is john the shadow on the ifs analysis this lost decade for living standards is unprecedented in modern history and is a damning indictment of the abject failure of the economic policy during their six wasted years in office the economic has meant decline in living standards for working people even as the and the big corporations are given large tax promised action in the autumn statement for those about instead he has betrayed them by continuing to slash failing to raise the living to the level failing to deliver more funding for our and social care and now threatening pensioners with removing the has different priorities and will prepare our economy for instead of cutting taxes for the and giant we will make sure our is properly support the pensions and introduce a real living wage built on an economy that invests for the so that and no community is left behind the ifs has now put up on its websites its distributional analysis slides one shows the impact of all tax and benefit reforms since the 2015 election they are highly regressive the gains in the autumn statement light green were very and came nowhere near compensating for the impact of the benefit cuts announced by last year distributional analysis this shows the impact of the tax and benefit changes on family groups pensioners have done especially wealthy pensioners families without children were in the and families with children have done worst distributional impact ifs and here are two more important charts from one of the ifs presentations one shows the impact the benefit freeze was going to have on families with inflation forecast to grow at the rate expected in march impact of inflation and the benefits freeze march figures this or rather the dark green bars in this show how the impact as got worse in the light of the new inflation forecasts impact of inflation and benefits freeze march figures and figures compared here is the laura commenting on these pm really wants to make families who 're having a hard time make ends meet feel better she has huge job if these estimates are 2016 here is a chart from one of the ifs presentations showing debt as proportion of national income going back to 1700 it has been much higher but the two previous peaks were caused by the wars and the second world war national debt ifs and here are some more lines from the ifs my colleague detailed analysis of outlook for living standards suggests younger have been and will be harder notes that majority of giveaway from yet another fuel duty freeze from the govt goes to better off half of the daily jack says the public debt been higher than this in the past during world war two oh and during the the verdict from the ifs is big losers from tax benefit reforms during this parliament will be low income caveat from the lots of uncertainty here we could get a to the economy actually hit a budget surplus after much for helping the ifs says autumn statement made no big hit was welfare suggests the respondents to our poll were on the money see the economy will be smaller for every household in by because of the vote to leave the on tweaks to universal is not how to design and introduce the biggest reform to our welfare system in john lists some abandoned tougher pip selling to for social tenants for insurance premium tax tax we need to worry about quite a as it the economy away from production involving yesterday did n't change fact the big losers over this parliament due to be low income mainly due to benefit credit so far 4 changes to work allowance 1 change to childcare support 1 change to withdrawal 2016 here are the key points from opening statement at the ifs autumn statement briefing said by 2021 wages would still be lower than they were in 2008 in real terms and that has not had such a period without earnings growth since the second world war said the expected rise in inflation meant the real value of the living would rise by just over during the course of this not as said inflation also meant that real value of working age benefits like that are currently frozen in cash terms will fall by rather than said had effectively adopted ed spending plans rather than aiming for budget balance in 2019 20 will be happy borrowing of national about in 2020 21 remember that at the last election the then shadow ed said he was aiming to balance the current budget by borrow just to invest keeping to that over the parliament would have allowed borrowing of just over of in 2020 21 to misquote it be far from the truth to say that the new fiscal plans they are he predicted that the government would have to spend more money on health or social care strikingly responded not at all to calls for more money for either the or social care going to stick my neck out and suggest he be able to do that for much longer he the government for continuing to freeze fuel duty every year instead of simply abandoning the proposed annual increases one of the more expensive measures announced was yet another freeze to fuel duty the seventh year in a row this has happened if the policy is never to increase fuel duty as seems to be the we should just be told rather than being told always that it will rise with inflation next year and then that never happening this is turning into a really big problem both for the treasury and for our approach to the taxation of motoring he said the forecasts were more than the bank of earlier this month the bank projected growth of 1 5 and in 2018 and 2019 respectively the projections are for growth of 1 7 and quite a big said policy in the autumn statement amounted to not in the face of deteriorating forecasts neither tightened fiscal policy nor followed his example of sticking with previous spending plans he loosened by an annual billion or so and he loosened in a rather specific mostly by increasing planned capital spending given the choice between jam today in the form of more money in pockets and jam tomorrow in the form of potential economic returns from greater he went for jam accused of being disingenuous about the increase in the insurance premium arguing that the rate was hard to justify guilty of too many fiscal infelicities but the way in which he announced the increase in was certainly one of them it is half the rate of he as if in explanation of the rise so it should be in fact it should be lower only the value of the insurance premiums net of pay outs which one should think of as being that would imply an rate much less than not more he said the ifs backed the idea of scrapping the autumn although he expressed about whether this would happen we will also wait and see whether this really is the last autumn statement we have been here before after all chancellor also moved from a separate autumn statement and spring budget to a single autumn budget that survive a change of occupancy at number 11 at the ifs briefing news here is the full text of opening presentation at the ifs briefing workers in face the biggest squeeze on their pay for 70 years as a blow to the economy knocks wage growth and stokes according to an analysis of the latest tax and spending over autumn the institute for fiscal studies said real wages in the pay adjusted for inflation will still be below their 2008 level in the director said in his presentation cannot stress how dreadful that is more than a decade without real earnings growth we have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 warning follows signs that the sharp fall since the referendum result is hiking the cost of imports to the and could soon be passed on to consumers at the same experts warn pay growth could stall as companies grapple with and economic the independent the office for budget said the economy would slow next year and inflation would a separate analysis of the autumn the resolution said families faced a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake of the financial crisis director of the institute for fiscal has just started the briefing on the autumn says wages in real terms will still be below their 2008 levels in 2021 this is he is the key quote the outlook for living standards has deteriorated rather sharply since march the is forecasting both lower nominal wage growth as a result of lower and higher inflation resulting from the exchange rate depreciation overall real average earnings are forecast to rise by less than between now and 2021 that means they will be lower in 2021 than was projected in march to put it another way around half of the wage growth projected for the next five years back in march is not now projected to happen on these projections real wages still be below their 2008 levels in 2021 one cannot stress enough how dreadful that is more than a decade without real earnings growth we have certainly not seen a period remotely like it in the last 70 years i will post a full summary of his statement shortly only a third of voters think the measures announced in the autumn statement will help the an poll conducted for the guardian carried out its survey last night although respondents were generally positive about the measures in the autumn statement they were asked overall they did not seem very convinced that policies would do a lot to help the if the package of measures announced by would be helpful or unhelpful to the the results also asked about six specific policies in the autumn all received either majority or plurality but there were some interesting measure with the highest net support was increasing the living by an hour to but the measure with the highest number of people both supporting and saying it would make a was increasing the income tax threshold to in measure announced by in but reconfirmed by the measure with the lowest net support was abandoning the 2019 20 budget surplus are the net support figures for the six policies saying they are in whether or not they think it will make a here are the same but this time listed in order of people saying they support them think the policy is sufficient to make a unlimited interviewed an sample of 1 , 317 adults aged on the evening of 23rd 2016 interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults is a member of the polling council and abides by its rules made in a

two helicopter trips in the register of one in 2015 to the forest of dean conservative dinner and another to north summer reception in this year tony has given a lengthy interview to the new statesman here are some of the top says that he wants to help resurrect politics as the guardian reported on he is setting up a new political next year in his interview he rules out a return to the political but he explains that he wants to help politicians who are challenging extremists what doing is to spend more time not in the front line of because i have no intention of going back to the front line of to correct another misunderstanding but in trying to create the space for a political debate about where modern western democracies go and where the progressive forces particularly find their place dismayed by the state of western but also incredibly motivated by it i think in got millions of effectively politically homeless people interested in doing is what are the types of ideas that we should be taking how do we provide a service to people who are in the front line of so that we can provide some thinking and some the thing really tragic about politics today is that the best ideas about politics in politics i find the ideas are much more interesting in the technology much more interesting ideas about how you change the says that could be reversed it can be stopped if the people decide having seen what it the analysis stack up and that can happen in one of two ways not saying it will by the but it could just until you see what it how do you the two ways in which could be he goes either you get maximum access to the single market in which case end up accepting a significant number of the rules on on payment into the on the jurisdiction people may then hang why are we leaving or be out of the single market and the economic pain may be very because beyond doubt if you do that have maybe a of economic restructuring the resolution foundation has published its full verdict on the autumn statement as my colleagues heather and it is saying that the squeeze on living standards over the next five years could be even worse than it was during the financial is there living standards squeeze be worse than after global read is how it starts families face a worse squeeze on their living standards over the next five years than they suffered in the wake of the financial as slows the economy and conservative welfare cuts according to a new of autumn statement by the resolution foundation suggests average earnings are set to grow only half as rapidly as in the austerity years after the economic crisis at the same living standards will be undermined by higher inflation and ongoing welfare the squeeze of the last parliament affected workers across the income the foundation says households are set to be hardest hit over the next five because they are particularly affected by planned welfare here is the full resolution foundation report john the shadow has also been giving interviews this morning here are the key points he has been indicated that wanted taxes to be but that it was not looking to increase the overall tax burden make sure that instead of giving tax giveaways to the wealthy and and ignoring the issue of tax avoidance and tax make sure we had a fair taxation system and in that way not talking about increasing taxes or anything like what we are saying is that we use our resources more will want to abide by the principles that you spend what you earn they have given tax on capital gains on corporation on inheritance tax to the wealthy in our community and also to corporations and what we saw yesterday they were cutting the universal credits that are going to be given to what they call the just about people going into looking after their doing everything asked of them so got the wrong priorities he defended decision to support a tax cut for people paying the higher rate of income tax is backing the plan to increase the tax threshold for people paying the higher rate of income tax asked about he there are large numbers of people earning above who are in jobs like train like senior teachers and others who have been hit and do need protecting if we are going to be doing redistribution we should be hitting those who are over for our policy is on reverting to the original tax system we had some years ago we have to that the reality of those people on middle incomes and the pressures that they are particularly with regard to housing costs in certain parts of our said was committed to keeping the triple lock the law that says pensions will rise every year by or in line with earnings or whichever is higher the are committed to keeping this until 2020 but in his autumn hinted that it could be dropped after that because it is too expensive asked if was right to review i would be very disappointed if he did the triple under the government brown wanted to tackle the issues around child poverty and pensioner poverty and that is what he did he lifted people out of poverty at both stages of their both children and older people if we can grow the and we have a fair taxation we can afford was right to say the last government did a lot to reduce pensioner but the triple lock was actually a coalition not a said the failure to set out its stance was increasing economic we do these negotiations without openness and transparency people need to know where is the government going and how is it going to get there at least then you things and people will be able to settle down into serious negotiations and we will get the best deal until the government gets to that we are going to have these uncertainties and this played down the significance of a picture showing many looking at their phones in the commons chamber when he was responding to yesterday he it look brilliant but what they do now and they have to think themselves the new style in parliament at the moment is people are tweeting all the time doing a running commentary on going on it look but what interesting because got these new devices all the tweeting all the but interestingly enough the general response to the points i was making was received quite well within parliament and interesting never seen this before and this is not me boasting if you looked at the opposite me and those i held their attention even though tweeting about what responded to and looked at their phones me for via 2016 here is a full summary of the main points from interviews this said the economic future was uncertain because no one knew what the outcome of the talks would be when it was put to him that the government was at fault for telling the office for budget responsibility very little about its he said that the government had said what it the greatest possible access to markets but the outcome of the negotiations would not just depend on what the government he went on the fact it is not about what we want the outcome to be going to be a negotiation we are going to sit at the table with the representatives of the union and at this can be certain about what the outcome of that negotiation will be that is what creates the whether you are a chancellor of the exchequer trying to forecast the public finances for a couple of years down the line or whether you are a businessman making an investment in a production said the government was preparing for range of possible from the talks a sensible and prudent thing to he defended the saying the government would be wrong to ignore its forecasts have the saying its forecasts about the impact of on the economy are wrong said it was important to remember that forecasting was not a precise science but he said the government would be wrong to ignore what it said economic forecasting is not a precise science and the itself makes the point in its report that there is a very high degree of uncertainty around the report that they issued yesterday because of the circumstances that they are it was put to him that this means he thinks the forecasts should be taken with pinch of as the telegraph claims this he i think we should look at what the report is we should certainly not ignore we should look at it as one of the possible range of outcomes that we need to plan has posted this on pointing out that was right to say the has acknowledged a high degree of is a wide range of uncertainty around the forecasts says this is true said the government was preparing for a possible economic slowdown next year to me it makes given the warning signals from the to keep a little bit of firepower in the to build a little bit of a reserve so that if there is a slowdown next got enough capacity to support the to protect to ensure that the economy can get through any headwinds it rejected claims that debt was out of control when it was put to him that the government had lost control of debt he not out of larger than we would like it to rejected claims that the autumn statement contained nothing for the families who are about when this was put to he i think true at all we are facing very significant fiscal challenges within the constraints that that tried to focus what firepower we do have on helping those who are ordinary working families who are to get the scheduled rise in fuel duty was an important step in that process reducing the taper in universal credit so that people in work on low wages are able to keep more of their wages recommitting to raising the personal allowance in the income tax system to 12 , 500 by the end of this parliament despite the fiscal challenges will leave everybody in this country better off and of course a rise in the living which will put 500 a year in the pockets of somebody over 25 working on the living i think those are important steps rejected claims that the government was now adopting the spending plans proposed at the 2015 general election would have exempted investment spending from borrowing he said he said his new fiscal rules included investment rejected claims that he ignored the in his statement when this was put to he it is not true that it was not mentioned if you read the it absolutely was mentioned as i said yesterday in it may have been my first autumn but not a complete rookie and i would not have failed to mention the rejected the ideal of playing any role in the relations with asked about he if i ever need any advice from got his number and give him a call tell him not to hold his breath on sky news sky news
city through after earns draw at read more and city qualify in second place behind are guaranteed a spot in the league and are out of oh this much of a truth be but city they can now spend the next three months concentrating on domestic john stones and of city applaud the traveling fans images 90 min with beating and this game are sure of league football so city are able to hold possession in the and the pragmatic hosts are happy to let them do it this is like watching west versus in albeit without too much scandal 90 there will be two additional minutes 88 city continue to fiddle around in the letting the clock do its thing within touching distance of the knockout stages 86 flicks a clever pass down the between a couple of to release into the area lashes into the but second disallowed goal of the evening offside and once more the correct decision 85 works and works to earn a corner on the left takes just to the left of the penalty and sends a free header wide left he should have at least got that on target 84 make their last change of the swapping their goalscorer for international 82 city are more than happy to knock it around the middle right now going but all the clock is their friend 80 a rare attack by opens his legs down the but with hovering in the loops a wild one straight through the area city are looking pretty comfortable right knowing through to the next round as things stand 79 slips into space down the right earns a corner kick after some intricate finds himself on the just to the right of the goal he a vicious straight at who does well to parry up and away from his own goal that was hit so it could have gone anywhere 77 city ping it around some more sit back suddenly breaks free down the left and earns a corner clears with a header that reaches the halfway line 74 having had their collective bubble deflated in the wake of needless regroup and pin the hosts back low crosses are fizzed into the area from both but each time a black shirt is first to the party and hacks clear 72 is really trying it on now he blocks a cross with his arms up a free which leads to but not really the it was a deliberate hand and he really should be walking by now 71 now is booked for a very agricultural slide on a case for a red card as he went in studs up for a split had two feet off the ground it looked more clumsy than but the letter of the law 69 makes good down the right and reaches the he cuts back for bombing in down the channel and city clear romps down the and is scythed to the ground by a ludicrously late challenge from a yellow all day long 68 city react to their red card by sacrificing sterling for 67 30 yards out and cutting in from the drops a shoulder to make some space and unleashes a superlative riser towards the top right in all the but tips it over the bar what a and a stunning the corner comes to nothing 65 and with the crowd having found their voice picks up possession on the edge of the city d and sends a shot trundling towards the bottom left just wide of the post not 100 percent sure bravo was getting across to that the home side are renewed 63 this is beyond stupid on a lightly tugs at the back of shirt in the circle not much of a hardly a tug but by the letter of the law and all that why take the risk when on a and a man and now ten versus ten pleads with referee after he sends him off in the second half images 62 battles and bustles down the and very nearly breaks clear into the area stands his ground and eventually wins a free kick cue ironic cheers from the home who are still sore about the departure of their captain 60 is replaced by who slots in at the back moves forward to take up the departing position 59 this is attack versus get hold of the ball at all slides into space down the right reaches the and looks for a friendly shirt in the middle his is snaffled by at the near post 57 city are all over now sterling is seeing a lot of the ball on the right he floats one to the far but is never getting and plucks from the sky 55 city being given etc 53 city stroke it around the middle of the park just because they can now the home support are whistling quite a especially when receives the ball 51 the captain is sent packing for a second picked up after he cynically a difficult evening for city has suddenly become a whole lot easier is shown a red card by referee images 50 enters the box on the right a chance to but he take it a swipe then he has another but only manages to screw the ball to his where sterling is sterling home with but the flag goes up for offside the correct decision 49 from the free 40 yards down the floats a ball to the far where stones really should go for goal from close range but he opts to head back across goal instead and is barged by as he leaps the pair square up but calm down soon enough 48 have barely touched the ball in this first half eventually all the city possession gets the better of who tugs at arm and is booked for his trouble in the before the teams pep takes a few seconds to drum a few extra words of beneficial advice into his you blame him for taking every opportunity to cram in a little more tuition during the on the evidence of the first fifteen hours have been long never mind 15 minutes city go immediately on the making good down the left but ballooning his cross into the stand behind the goal with the box loaded some hot champions league chat on why failed to make it out of their signings and lack of why failed in the champions league read more and that for the first fair to say city are a little lucky to be given the way defended at times but a moment of sheer quality has put a different sheen on this game at the break the home side will be livid with themselves for easing off before the whistle now got a chance to knock some sense into his defenders should be a cracker of a second half go now no city in their very next and with the last kick of the finds sterling with a clever pass down the right channel sterling helps it on to who bursts towards the before firing a low cross inside on the edge of the pokes what a crisp passing for city 45 city should be scoops a gorgeous pass down the channel to spring sterling into the area shades of offside maybe not but perhaps a little doubt in because instead of battering a shot he checks he cuts inside for instead the striker looks for the bottom but his shot is smothered by 44 is booked for a foul on in the as once again prepare to launch a sortie 42 is everywhere right now set along the right wing by he nears the then cuts back to just to the right of the city d puts his foot through the but sends his shot miles over the bar city could do with hearing the whistle here not being as but every time launch an finding all sorts of holes in the city back line
appearing on that most revered of presidential forums called trump released a video this week describing his plans to great again for and i mean learned not to believe magnanimous but others really want told on that we should give trump opportunity to develop the positive objectives that he may and told an audience in that he wants be respectful of the office and give the an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every forgive because about to pop off have you lost all sense of you and talk as if we have no idea who trump is or what he has been saying for months on end but trump has made it abundantly clear opportunistic words of inclusion notwithstanding that his administration will be loyal to the fringes of the united leaving even the republican establishment running behind announced cabinet choices simply leave no room for imagining a gentler at the helm of the those of us concerned about the fate of the undocumented or the environment or reproductive rights see much reason to worry with the selection of mike and general t to inner circle list reads like a roll call to the dick fan among many other troubling all these men also share a deep antipathy to views are as scary and they are well known pick for national security adviser has called a and stated that is a political that behind this notion of it being a that is not talking about the that republicans frequently invoke but about asked about current republican national committee chair and designated chief of staff told news that are some aspects of the faith that are very i realize that was a scholar of or perhaps even a a renewer of the faith according to popular comes to revive the practice of for following generations or maybe he just said an ignorant thing that would sound bigoted if it were about another religion but today sounds like comments are troubling rather than enabling establishment republicans as a moderating influence on the the trump administration is pulling the traditional down its own giving less extreme republicans about as much voice in this new administration as chair actually worse at least the chair had the good sense to stay quiet my worry extends beyond the realm of what this administration says and reaches into what it will do building a wall on the border is a near physical impossibility the immediate deportation of millions of people is much harder to execute than it sounds but the that can and most likely will secretary of state another hardliner who is in the running for homeland security recently met with trump and was photographed holding his strategic plan for first 365 openly in his hands nobody give this man the nuclear plain for the world to see was the of an useless program of the bush administration officially called and more commonly known as i remember vividly the panic and confusion among the of new city when special registration was first enacted in 2002 this which required visa holding men from 24 countries and north to register with the was a massive failure even the own auditor found the program to be ineffective and a huge waste of resources the cost to taxpayers was more than a year and the program alienated around the world from the united states families were torn apart because of special and the brilliant program netted a grand total of zero terrorism registration was useful only as a tool to disrupt average lives and to spend a lot of money needlessly it served no security function and trump is considering reviving it we can assume because it will make this government like doing on the backs of ordinary then this justifying a registry on fox trump surrogate positively invoked internment as a legal precedent for the program that heinous comparison led the new times to publish an by a law professor reassuring us even if the legal decision authorizing internment has never been we be worried because the judiciary now sees the legal justification for internment as constitutional that whole exercise is nuts the question is not about the constitutionality of internment the question is why the hell are we talking about internment are we seriously working through the legal likelihood or unlikelihood of holding large numbers of completely innocent people in detention racial hysteria led us down that road once to say that panic lead us down a similarly treacherous with or without a 1944 legal precedent beginning to feel like one major terrorist attack from martial law in this and the new administration even taken office yet a fiction in the us that is frequently promoted by the likes of fox news and that had a major impact on this election the notion is that in our multicultural white get theirs while every minority and special interest group gets extra privileges the idea cultivates a mood of bitterness and even if fundamentally untrue many honestly believe that are getting special privileges that some accept will lead to the imposition of sharia law in this country but this is ludicrous want special privileges we just want to be treated the same way that everyone else is treated going to get special registration hardly a fair need more than assurances from trump that thinking about the whole country when he invokes we need to know that equality under the law will be guaranteed under his administration in what we really need to be doing is proving to all that everyone deserves to be treated equally while acknowledging all of our and that the kind of equality that makes for a stronger until that day every one of us needs to be popping off while we because if we there may come a time when popping off is not just useless but illegal pop everywhere you whenever you can pop all

some of the tailwind for the consumer is likely to be there are also factors that could bring the consumer down to earth as inflation is likely to continue to increase in the coming real wages will

the government has been given a blunt warning to stay out of the business by a senior leader in the who lambasted for his and insisted would have say any in the future of the first has accused the government of sending out a welcome message to nationals speaking to investors at the annual asset management conference in she more than anything our economic success will depend on nurturing the talent of those already in and of those who believe ours is the kind of welcoming country that allows ambition to position of the government and some others is very different from the refusal to guarantee the status of fellow nationals living in and the to the threat to draw up lists of foreign the government seems intent on sending out a welcome am determined that we send out a different one that says to all those working and studying in that they are most definitely welcome all from me for for the comments my colleague the diplomatic seems to agree with sir man in us today briefed national security council on the implications of trump 's election imagine doing 2016 but sir who himself served as ambassador in has told the independent that that giving the job to would be the

decision to leave the is a disastrous mistake which will inflict economic damage on but we are where we are given has got itself into this absurd we need to look for escape routes is probably one of the few people with a chance of persuading the trump administration to make a trade deal a top of the reasons for rejecting a ambassadorship amount to little more than wounded pride suggestion is a humiliating breach of protocol it is just a foretaste of the indignities that trump is likely to inflict on over the next four years looking forward to that state visit to the statistics authority has

sustainability of the that recent years had seen an increase in the number of surgeons who were coming to work in the around one in five surgeons in the in england come from the said he percent of surgeons on specialist registers in this country trained overseas these half trained in and the other half trained outside and what has happened in recent years is the number of people coming from outside has been diminishing while the numbers coming from within has been if that tap was to be turned off there could be potentially a significant problem certainly for prof president of the royal college of told to of our workforce is from the done the numbers yet because it is still up in the i think suffice to it is not on the department of most senior civil servant told the public accounts committee that issues surrounding workforce from the was one of the main priorities for the team working on on the daily politics mike the armed forces said that the government was now backing a private bill that would making posing as a veteran and wearing medals that you have not earned a criminal whole government is going to back this now on penning said the bill has been tabled by the conservative mp who says who pretend they have won medals for when that is not the should be punished a former captain in the royal marines who received the conspicuous gallantry cross for his service in told the that the bill was unnecessary he i think just going too far to suggest someone could go to prison i think very important to look at going on with someone that is actually pretending that they served in the armed forces there may well be a serious mental health problem and actually that person just has low not a threat to the and they actually need professional help downing street and the foreign office have slapped down a suggestion from the us that would be a good ambassador to as said the inflammatory views made him a poor candidate for a diplomatic electoral commission has begun an investigation into whether broke election funding laws by apparently using money from a parliament group to fund failed attempt to win a and in the the foreign has for attacking stance on climate change during foreign office questions in the commons he also claimed that hoped to and the actions of the trump administration and and a and chair of the party in the has said he thinks the wants to stay in the single market speaking after a meeting with the in the weber what we really expect are clear proposals in my talk with unfortunately i have not heard anything i have not heard much as to how the government wants to tackle and what really means i have not received any new quite the opposite is i have been told that the as far as the economy is it wants to stay in the single market but the government would also like to continue and have very close in legal downing street said that the position had not changed and that it wanted trading relationship that allows companies to trade both with and within the single market and lets businesses do the weber has also for promoting the idea of turkey joining the while he spread alarm about it during the referendum campaign referring to weber himself in the leaflets where he showed and as possible members of the making people afraid of possible migration waves he used it himself and then a few weeks afterwards he is to and he is offering support for becoming a member of the union it is it is a provocation and it is arrogant what we hear from him i cannot respect this any what he is doing in this factories are poised to raise both output and prices over the coming months as they continue to adjust to the impact of the referendum in as the latest snapshot of the economy from the confederation of industry showed that order books for manufacturers are strong and production is expected to rise at its fastest pace in almost two years over the next three the warned that the fall in the value of the pound since the vote was pushing up the cost of the raw materials and components used by industry and factory gate prices were going up at their fastest rate since early the former head of the civil has told the commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee that the civil service will have to expand if it wants to be able to cope with both and its normal government duties he there is a genuine issue about capacity to manage both the demands of which is complex and with big and at the same time taking forward a set of other policy initiatives that government wants to take up i think not possible to do that at a point where the civil service is at its lowest number since the second world war and continuing to government ought to do some form of independent or assessment of its preparedness for this huge task got ahead of it on who is accused of murdering the mp has opted not to give evidence in his at the old as the jury was told that had declined to appear as a witness in the trial flint said the would offer no other the has claimed ministers a over speaking at the annual conference of the airport operators association who campaigned for frankly very little evidence apart from some mildly lunatic optimism over here that it will be all right on the night like army going off to war here be all right sergeant just keep plodding along these guys have no idea where going for the next two years and the problem is that in the absence of any discussions with the on all talking to themselves they stand up in the houses of parliament going to do a good deal for any idea what a good deal looks they a is going to walk itself off a cliff unless somebody in the party comes up with a bright government has published plans for a major overhaul of aid spending that would allow billions of pounds of development funding to be into the controversial private equity the financial times reports may has been hosting talks with her opposite in downing street this morning may with the prime minister in number 10 this morning via here is my colleague take on suggestion that should be appointed ambassador to the tweet queries how special our relationship should be read here is how it starts interest in other world leaders has sometimes seemed closely related to whether or not his family has a golf course or luxury hotel under construction in their territory the conversations reportedly turn as much to completing a planning permission as a peace it will have been with alarm that downing street woke up this morning to find trump has been involved in some more twitter diplomacy advising the interim would make a great ambassador to from underlining how social media has become integral to modern the tweet reveals how strong and deep connections are with the how little he possibly cares or possibly knows about diplomatic and how much his ego precedes all else here is in the commons saying there is no vacancy for ambassador to the us on ambassador is no video says that although the is leaving the it is not leaving he says he wants to carry on hosting the 2023 capital of culture and he wants the to carry on participating in events like this after it leaves is now taking topic questions in the commons these are questions that have not been tabled in and so any subject can come up here is the mp black on comments on black mp to telling us to look for positives in trump 's administration reminds me of this no is worth racism 2016 and here is the quote from where he said the government hoped to and the actions of the trump administration he was responding to the mp i do think it is very important that on all sides of this house we should be as positive as we possibly can be about working with the incoming us administration it is of massive importance to our country and indeed to the world and i suggest to the member that he should judge that new administration by their actions in office of we hope to shape and influence and here is the quote where he said the would urge trump to accept the reality of climate change he was responding to and he i think it is vital that we are as positive as we can possibly be about the new as i have said i believe the relationship is of vital importance i think that trump is a deal maker and when it comes to climate this is something that the has led on we have had outstanding success yes very open with the house it is a message that we are taking to the we believe it to be we believe it be in the interests of the united states and of the world here is the quote where said attacks on trump were against the national the shadow foreign said that election was a dangerous development for the future of our because he thought climate change was a hoax she asked if may would have the moral backbone to tell he is wrong on climate when she visited him in and said if trump refuses to change his stance on climate may should condemn him i really must say to the right lady that i believe she is being premature in her hostile judgments of the and any such premature i could be damaging to the interests of this country it is important for us in this country to use our which is very to help the united states to see its as sure they will climate attack on trump could damage national interest video asks to confirm that the government is considering a transitional deal on says the government will get the best possible deal for the it will be for the and the he says the shadow foreign says we meet on the 53rd anniversary of john f death says trump is a and that we have every reason to be positive about him why should be be positive about his views on climate says it is vital we are as positive as we can be about says trump is a deal maker when it comes to climate this is something the has led on the will be taking this message to the trump he says will urge trump to accept the reality of climate says trump thinks climate change is a hoax invented by the will may tell trump he is wrong and will she condemn trump if he scraps the climate change says is being and he says trump like this is against the national says attacks on trump are against the national interest
a wonderful and discussion of an immensely complex and issue some final forcing the hand of policy makers and developing responses to poverty are vital to elephant conflict cannot be but we can try to control how humans network of parks and wild lands is needed to allow elephants to roam out demand and the legal market in china is going to be but the government appears to be for the future is not but it is probably limited to small pockets of land an entirely i will but my this excellent panel give us measured hope for the future 22 2016 many countries afraid it will not possible we often forget central and west where elephants are in many areas doomed if we cannot stop the current elephant poaching your grandchildren will probably be able to see wild elephants only in a handful of in the eastern and southern tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people 22 2016 but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat build community support for reduce reduce trafficking through market and dramatically reduce demand for the number of places with significant numbers of wild functioning as they will be very much smaller than now but there is real 22 2016 think so because high value tourism areas will be maintained they might be like and in in getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the know what the word in is for pest animals with no value vermin current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of rural communities 22 2016 i think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant specialists talking about the just local abundant populations in one or two we can get ivory under control and poaching significantly lessened and i strongly believe that if we do n't want simply islands of elephants but migrating we have to plan this now and in the next 5 10 years while we have something to work with this applies in where the elephant specialist group just met last week for all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the question is back to you are you with we need you to make your desire known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their habitat elephants are whose elephant family focuses on elephants paints a frightening picture of the future 22 2016 the past 100 years of elephant populations have been wiped out without this iconic animal could be facing extinction within 3 which is why this species is listed as endangered they now number as few as 40 , 000 across 13 countries in with probably occurring in habitat loss of and fragmentation of populations are causing and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing as well as hunting for ivory though not all elephants have tusks and females do n't have retaliatory killing for such as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains or setting out poison bait such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants have been reduced to crop especially in places where people have settled and have no history of living or knowing how to live with stiles also thinks things are looking bleak 22 2016 destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer it 's remarkable how well they 've done in and when you think of the population pressures it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase in and carvers are still churning out the and read how various states are planning what can be done says 22 2016 we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more where elephants need to move and what they need to eat we can lessen the interaction between people and elephants and help people safely we can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are ready with the so there is but we need to act now as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal poaching in we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in to protect space and empower people to allow our largest land mammal still have room to roam our biggest project at the moment with other is our corridors campaign on asks why we use funds from tourism to support local communities so they turn to just not enough to go says 22 2016 there are working examples of involving local communities in the way you it 's simply a drop in the ocean there are million and millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually with tourism and you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or brokers to create havoc a huge human toll behind the ivory trade and poor exploited people are a big part of it 22 2016 the same situation in even with the number of poor people who actually benefit from it whose lives are uplifted by its effects is a very small number whatever the solution it has to be more though out and must benefit the poor community in money also fails to reach the communities says hedges 22 2016 the reason is that entrenched big businesses that are not set up to provide significant benefits to the local people in and around the areas corruption is sometimes a problem too governments need to do more to and otherwise help local initiatives and to require more equitable benefit sharing by the big operations you are correct to say that in can generate see the paper i referenced weaver g c complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal conservancies in says there is an important role for development aid to play to fill these gaps 22 2016 think community needs are greater than the support they are especially in many but the rural poor in all countries where elephants range are too often left on their own in the places where wildlife still exists are in places where the most people live they may not even know when there is a government compensation scheme that can help them so i do n't think elephant populations always need to for through trophy hunting or tourism income but i think that better access to development or government aid or even an farming and access to markets can boost the morale and empowerment of communities those communities also do not want to be a target for criminal gangs preying on the unemployed to poach strong communities are a very important part of this and support so they can use techniques or understand elephant routes help prevent interaction stiles says this is already underway in 22 2016 is a critical question and in right now there is a group doing exactly planning protected corridors to be left open to connect protected areas and private conservancies all range states should conduct such including corridors and hedges agrees 22 2016 elephants do need large areas of habitat and even in we are now seeing habitat fragmentation and loss become a significant problem for elephant conservation in of habitat loss has long been one of the biggest threats to which are now largely confined to protected many of which are too small for long term viability and have huge problems on their borders maintaining connectivity or restoring it if already lost is essential as notes there are some encouraging examples from countries such as and but much more needs to be done in many more places for those feeling far away and here are some concrete actions you can take today 22 2016 agree with lobbying governments these should be considered world heritage animals and as global citizens we can help strengthen that argument and get more resources put towards forest and wildlife departments stronger departments aid better resource and not only help provide stability but can stand up for protection of habitat for the good of communities and wildlife preventing environmental damage of silting of polluted water which communities later i also endorse that people worldwide support the conservation that can help direct research and aid to experts and communities for bringing about local solutions say most panelists although there are some caveats 22 2016 think the quote is the mother of applies here some of the most innovative community schemes have come about when trophy hunting was not an and then other aid schemes and other government departments participated in community not just wildlife stiles says it could work for some species but not elephants 22 2016 not convinced that trophy hunting is essential to conserving at least elephant maybe other species it 's a complicated from elephant action league 22 2016 hunting is often the of government that do not want to protect wildlife and provide local communities with real economic hedges agrees complicated but also perhaps an issue by both advocates and relative to its potential impact 22 2016 i would personally never shoot an animal for its trophy there have been some successful examples of trophy hunting for some species generating revenues for and encouraging attitudes among local people trophy hunting has the potential to provide those benefits in difficult places where there are few other options for trophy hunting can therefore help keep significant areas of land under wildlife land that might otherwise not be so used but in some places trophy hunting operations have predator introduced or bred trophies all of which are bad for biodiversity conservation it 's complicated it is also hard to see that trophy hunting is likely to ever play a significant role in elephant conservation the amount of money generated by trophy hunting is also small relative to the funding needs for conservation in and so in some ways the heated debates are a distraction from the bigger issues hunter life after global outrage into funding for conservation in conservation letters 296 301 has asked via email how we go about fighting the illegal trade when it is so stiles 22 2016 the demand where consumers law enforcement in pretty much every country has proven ineffective if high demand prevails if shops are closed traders and consumers move to websites and members only social media demand must be but this is a long of elephant family points 22 2016 the words of a wildlife enforcement illegal investigation and enforcement is still woefully inadequate in the countries that matter states and there 's a need to this is a crime problem and the response needs to be police led customs have demonstrated they have mandate and therefore little will to investigate the hundreds of ivory seizures made to date many techniques still are n't being such as controlled forensic analysis of crime scenes for links to and lack of proactive responses sources within the trade have indicated that serious offenders are only afraid of imprisonment if actually yet such a deterrent barely hedges of 22 2016 is correct to stress the challenges inherent in demand reduction and there needs to be a much greater focus on effecting change not just raising we have seen to little of the former in demand reduction campaigns to date but demand for wildlife products including ivory and rhino horn has been reduced in the past in a number of so we know it can be done elephants are wild animals and so conflict is hard to according to the panel consultant stiles says we can only control how humans respond 22 2016 those who suffer the depredations of the only thing that has been demonstrated to prevent retaliation is if the people gain tangible benefits very few places have mechanisms in place for that have to involve says wildlife 22 2016 between humans and wildlife cannot be avoided however solutions have to come from the people living with wildlife innovative ideas of how to live harmoniously ca n't take a top down they have to build economic says hedges in a comment too long to post so link to it here he also suggests further investigating insurance and other ways to manage or understand the impact on humans 22 2016 addition to trying to ensure local people derive direct financial benefits from the presence of wildlife such as elephants whenever a key part of mitigating conflict or conflict more generally is to adopt a sound approach to testing and promoting effective reduction methods there are methods that can help reduce some circumstances at out there but they need to be deployed more effectively approaches such as insurance need to be further tested and developed too most including hedges from agree that the mean it when they say they will phase out their legal ivory 22 2016 i think the government is serious about shutting down the domestic market in ivory in china that commitment was announced at the highest level in a joint communique from president xi and president in 2015 earlier this year the authorities said publicly that they would announce the timetable for implementing the so we can expect to see that announcement points out that there has been little movement since they made their announcement a year ago 22 2016 this is govt has n't announced a even though hong which is 2020 can we be sure that china is serious about even after we now that officials from high office are involved in the of points out the difficulty in enforcing laws in a country as vast as china 22 2016 the ending of the domestic legal trade in whiles it will undoubtedly help we should also be aware that it is a recurring pattern in china that good laws can be passed but that enforcement failure can lead to unexpected results china often resists legislation for as long as then acts when the diplomatic costs become too high but that is not the same as effective enforcement china is a very big reach is less effective than many outsiders and enforcement may not be a priority if you look at the overall movements in the relatively recent surge in demand from for both ivory and rhino i suspect that the bulk of both are being smuggled into china it 's a change of route rather than a drop in who works with the elephant specialist believes some news might be imminent 22 2016 heard they will announce the plan in it will involve a phased allowing ivory traders and factories to dispose of their as hong has done before our panel convenes at here is some reading material that could provoke

elephant populations are collapsing at a frightening rate and that the driving forces behind this collapse are a global appetite for ivory just as conflict for space and resources earlier this the governments agreed to recommend the closure of domestic ivory markets this is a serious step towards the eventual complete shutting down of the ivory but now new questions are do governments go about shutting down the legal ivory an illegal ivory market could be even harder how do we strengthen forces against the black human populations move into elephant conflict is a real and growing problem that may even come to dwarf the ivory trade can we avoid these what works in terms of supporting local what works in terms of preserving elephant this is a global but with different challenges for

often claims to possess the finest justice system in the with a approach to the law this justice is neither nor is it the justice system has been used to and then from england onwards in between 1951 and during the more than 1 , 090 were executed by the colonial backed by the foreign and commonwealth office this appalling figure represents the most liberal use of the death penalty in legal history and is double the number of those executed by the during the war of liberation in 10 years more recent judges have enforced the unjust laws informal name used for laws which still disproportionately affect it can be argued that racism is embedded in the of the judiciary and that it has proved uniquely resilient to education or to what extent is racism present in the system a study headed by published last makes for very disturbing statistics regarding how differently and white suspects were dealt with in the criminal justice system helped to trigger race training for all judges over a period those statistics have not improved if you are an man you are more likely to be remanded in custody than if you are you are also likely to obtain a custodial sentence of 24 months compared to your white 17 months this is not because men commit more serious than their white counterparts these are punishments handed down for the same or similar men are also subject to receiving immediate custodial sentences with fewer previous convictions than their white counterparts our perceptions have become the reality that means of all young people in detention are now from communities if you are you are more likely to be remanded in custody than if you are is critical is that the report yet the fundamental racist disparities in the administration and dissemination of justice there is a crisis of both trust and confidence in the judicial system among black communities their concerns are that it remains inconsistent and discriminatory this interim report proves them right despite its diplomatic homelessness and drug addiction all play their as does the disproportionate influence of an institutionally racist police which means black defendants are stopped and searched seven times more often than their white counterparts this is despite falling and falling crime and search is a disgrace across the not just in our cities read significant responsibility for this disparity of treatment still lies with an overwhelmingly middle class and male magistracy and resistant to ethnic which hides behind the fallacy that justice is blind and cannot expect to have a diverse judiciary and and to recruit police probation prison officers and lawyers who look like us and are knowledgeable of our if we are forced to operate in a system that is itself unwilling or unable to deliver justice equally to all as martin king is not possible to be in of justice for some people and not to be in of justice for all out of 161 members of the high court there is not a single while only two are of origin less than of oxford and graduates whom of high court judges are are of origin the legal pipeline and the outcome are a prophecy the race training introduced in was only introduced on the basis that high court judges were as they simply did not require it that rather arrogant intellectual exception must now be comments last night suggest that he knows judicial diversity needs tackling i am currently suing the ministry of justice for race discrimination and arising out of short speech on judicial racism and human rights i gave it was at a meeting to protest at the decision of an electoral deputy high court judge to ban the former mayor of tower from holding public office for five years the allegation was that i indirectly a fellow the first time any judge has ever faced disciplinary action for this months in there was an attempt to suspend approved by several high court and the judicial conduct investigations who threatened me with a formal suspension this was at the same time that a fellow immigration judge of origin had her complaint of sex and race discrimination ignored while the three white judges accused were never faced with suspension a fellow district judge still faces disciplinary sanctions for a minor complaint that at most was a competence and three other judges are currently suing the ministry of justice the treatment of judges by our white colleagues demonstrates a culture in which we are not accepted as equals with a fundamental right to challenge discrimination little wonder then that defendants and litigants face race discrimination in all minorities more likely to be jailed for some report finds read if one achieves a of judges and the injustice is unlikely to be eradicated if the culture of who is perceived to be the likely recidivist or the most offender persists the only solution is the one resisted by the ministry of and by most senior judges that is monitoring each crown court and magistrates so that there can be proper scrutiny of individual courts to identify where the problem to this must be a full by the sentencing council that sentencing and bail guidance must set out clearly the levels of disparity for each simply pretending the problem does not exist is a recipe for unconscious but appalling levels of racial bias to continue training on race from 1991 to 1995 as it forced judges to engage with mentors who challenged subconscious bias and racism as equals in a secure setting the race awareness training in the 20 years since has been discredited as wholly ineffective it is too conducted infrequently and by fellow judges who themselves are part of the judiciary is a pillar of our democracy with a historical responsibility for the racism that affects our fundamental freedoms and rights if that is to it must work hard to eradicate disproportionate sentences and bail that remove the freedom and rights of people of justice cannot be the prerogative of a white who believe that racism is

fixing social care has to be the immediate social policy priority for the both in this autumn statement and says the crisis is so the human impact so that it can no longer be ignored want elderly people or adults with complex needs living a life that and what we have at the the shadow communities says that next will be or for social care the she is teetering on the services are cut to the statutory minimum and an estimated one million people who need care get no providers can no longer afford to deliver services and are handing back contracts were thinking that this was a wave we would ride and a better day would but it and it has just got the system by plugging the funding gap is says but it is also time to look at the bigger to build a financially sustainable care one that takes pressure off a creaking enables people to grow old without fear and with and that values care workers she has to show that it the seriousness of the social care not just with but with a strategic vision of how the will provide for its society after six years of cuts to local she the problem is not just that services are but that councils now struggle to look beyond the multiple crises of austerity would like to see a commitment to the idea of integrating health and social care to think beyond simply patching up the current system and start working out what services we and how we pay for them need to fund councils to allow them to not just manage today and next but to have to is standing in for mp currently receiving treatment for lymphatic does not fit the stereotype of the modern career politician with little experience of real life she did not enter parliament until the age of 55 it was as an when she apropos of welfare cuts and rising that whole fabric of what we think is a decent society is breaking she does so as someone rescued from poverty by a properly functioning welfare services and the welfare she the epitome of what society is as a south mum aged she was abandoned by her then husband was left literally holding the and we were living in a terrible slum so i got social a place in a and a careers all funded through a welfare system that set me and my daughter on a road to prosperity that exist any more the welfare state is there so that we all help each other intervention in the was the stability it provided led the way to a successful career as a tax investigator and senior manager at you invest a little in it actually saves that hand to help me up meant that repaid it goodness knows how many times i was a my daughter we repaid it a million times over the reason happy to pay my taxes is that i want other people to have those life if you invest a little in it saves i and my daughter have repaid that hand that helped me many personal experience may help explain why though she makes no specific commitments she does not shy from making the case for why public services not only need investment but that the most effective way to achieve this is through taxation she accepts there is a huge fear among politicians of even when borrowing is and it saves money in the long run sees her own teenage interaction with the welfare state as a perfect example of but she points out there is a cost also to not funding she cites the spent by councils in the last five years on housing homeless families in emergency accommodation we borrowing money to train young to build the houses that we need so we are not spending an absolute fortune that is going directly into the pockets of private landlords she would like to see more honesty and realism about tax and spend she worries that politicians pretend to voters that we can have lower taxes and still retain quality services people think they get nothing from but politicians never properly explain that the services they from roads to happen by accident vision is we all chip in when we can so that nobody falls she supports devolved powers for and the freedom from the hand

hold a referendum over whether to raise council tax from the cap to in order to meet a black hole would see huge reductions in all council services in putting council tax up in deprived areas going to help because your council tax base is quite low and you are actually just punishing people who are deprived in the first on the other a referendum might actually start a proper public debate about what the central purpose of the council what it should provide and how we fund it she the result of the referendum will be i but the good thing hopefully is that local people in will understand why

bloodbath of an a friend emailed me watching someone get another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the third draft dodger is now commander in to the full flowering of the era of which began with that now glide down the escalator at trump where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic when sends its not sending their best sending people that have lots of and bringing those problems with us bringing drugs bringing crime rapists and i are good ever a monument is erected to the trump then surely these words shades of will be carved into the marble along with coming out of her bucks a and would bring back a hell of a lot worse than in true demagogic trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many temperate hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled years and years of internalized from a culture that kept insisting on tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these and to be free of freed from this code that was jamming us

of teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner this damage done to is said during one of the republican which is a laugh if wanted to trash the all he had to do on taking office in 2009 was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to the issue is bigger than any particular president after his on one the is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning goes to the heart of the matter the system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of the of and and that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early as leaders in newt and tom delay chief among declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation in world of moral were enemy of normal and his allies were fighting no less than a with and as he declared in a speech to the heritage war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil so began the constitutional hardball and tactics that have characterized the past of politics you may recall the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1995 96 over budget and the 1998 impeachment of bill for lying about a in more recent there was the famous dinner at a steakhouse on the evening of 20 2009 the day of inauguration at which congressional leaders with by then a highly paid k street vowed to sabotage presidency by opposing every item on the new economic agenda at a time when 700 , 000 jobs a month were disappearing including those items previously supported or even proposed by the all rooting for said of trump when they met recently in the oval office if he senate republican leader later summed up the stance when he publicly single most important thing we want to achieve is for president to be a burying was the and if bringing him down required shredding the constitutional then to hell with the past 220 years of constitutional order the once reserved for only the most major policy became routinely deployed even for matters by withholding funding or refusing to consider appointments to government the senate effectively nullified laws that had been duly enacted in accordance with the constitution at a time when the federal courts had a record number of scores of judicial seats went the current vacancy on the supreme court is merely the most example government shutdowns and crises once unthinkable became so endemic that for the first time in its more than standard downgraded the credit rating of the citing the phenomenon of even lawmakers have continued to use the threat of government default as a bargaining a nuclear option if carried would have catastrophic effects on the world the founding fathers wanted they have replaced the articles of confederation with the constitution but been great for the republican which has mastered a crude but so far effective campaign as the on a platform decrying government as dysfunctional and then once in power pull out all the stops to make sure government is dysfunctional and ineffective maybe this is why congress has lower approval ratings than head lice and and why has the perpetually serene look of a man who sleeps well at night those low approval ratings mean his side is winning that all this has happened at the expense of the constitutional and of the spirit of comity and good faith so necessary for the functioning of that seems not to trouble or his colleagues in the call these people is a joke they seek to

our economic fear and anger with a rawness that even try to match in no surprise that she lost the and primaries and very nearly the nomination to a candidate who tapped into the same populist angst that would give trump no fewer than 290 electoral college votes though one wonders whether all those good working folks who voted for trump realized they were endorsing a huge tax cut for the and a candidate whose election left k street as giddy as a girl asked to the prom by the handsomest boy in wish i thought things would seem even slightly less terrifying in a day or some escapist literature i find detailed accounts of the first world war and disastrous arctic expeditions very readable at times like system we this system that grinds huge numbers of people into it seems so vast and monolithic most of the an unstoppable machine steered by mysterious forces trump seemed to offer a rare chance to throw a wrench into the and many took it that a much bleaker side to his victory

after all this sort of backstroking belies been obvious all trump has never had much in the way of policy goals besides serving the greater good of will be the guiding principle of the trump

play badly look to for a taste of the awful potential to the tragedies and history those coils of ego and empire and wealth sex and sex and that often end with bodies all over the place the best thing trump could do for his children would be to put his assets in a genuine blind and send the kids away far away from to do their own thing limit visits to holidays and bounce the grandkids on his not breathe a word about business or affairs of not how monarchies roll that trump would put his children in such a legally tenuous position gives us a clear idea as if we needed it from a man who used to rely on the infamous for legal counsel of his appreciation for the rule of law here again we can expect the monarchical model people rarely grow in humility once they reach the white house to the extent trump attempts to spin and mutilate the rule of his most immediate potential check will be a congress firmly in republican led by the same wrecking crew already shown such faint regard for the

he must be disappointed by that typo in the first line of the email that was my first thought when the following landed in my might sound shocking and but i feel shocked or threatened this was just another day on the where people disproportionately people of color and queer people are intimidated and threatened what writer describes as a ceaseless flickering hum of emotional women abandoned to their abusers read around the same time i assume the same signed me up to a which meant i received thousands of unsolicited email newsletter within a few hours thankfully filters learn but it took a 20 minutes of flagging messages to clean up my a mild irritation meanwhile on someone else was sending me pornographic and asking whether penis size matters for a i blocked as sure i will have to block many others in the future in a tedious game of would love to say that this is but not in go as far as to say that this feels entirely just your regular rape threats and dreary dick for one of my is dealing with racial slurs or having her profile photo edited to have for a male people telling him to commit suicide or saying they want his kids to die if we complain about these either overreacting or feeding the trolls but if we speak letting them get away with it by this we fall back on swatting the antagonists away like flies perhaps as a coping telling ourselves that normal most of the the flies are few and far between but you only have to look at the relentless campaigns of hate against public figures like actor and comedian diver tom or games developer to see what happens when the flies form a swarm it becomes exhausting and incredibly difficult for the individual or the police to make on what constitutes a credible in the media you are familiar with how things work but for an average person these types of interactions could be said author of this is why we have nice how did we get and what should we do about many are aggrieved white men who feel like they given the fantasy life they were author of bullies have always found ways to antagonize but digital tools have given them new powers fifty years ago if you wanted to wind up a you could write anonymous messages and leave them on his or her could tease that but there would be no archive and it be amplified it could potentially be upsetting but it be indexed in said the ability of search to index abuse or what she calls that changes the ethical stakes your history follows you meaning those targeted struggle to move on and have a fresh and have been part of the since its inception a side effect of anonymity and unfettered free both critical pillars of the web once restricted to niche forums and with their own codes of ubiquitous social media has brought it into the used to be so few people occupying those spaces and the people who were were a lot more than what you see said means more and more just teenagers in their basements a lot of them are otherwise very well adjusted normal adult men with wives and children and said author of of them fall into the camp of very aggrieved middle aged white men who feel like they given the fantasy life they were owed they tend to take it out on people who are successful or present in a way that makes them feel not to say that white men get harassed but that harassment is more frequently directed at members of historically underrepresented populations whose voices have not always been privileged people who have always had their voices taken seriously tend to be the said arguing that it comes from a sense of trump that same sense of disenfranchisement that propelled trump to the white house with a campaign that normalized says absurdly offensive degrading things about women and people of color and specific groups whether whatever he says these terrible things and that normalizes hate speech in mainstream discourse so normal to open up or any news and see says tenor of discourse that trump and his associates have been engaging in has emboldened some people to say are in charge now and we can say whatever we adds a student at school of communication and comments about sexually harassing women are a reflection of the normalization of violence against threats and rape threats are a form of domination that has been used against women for all of time it ties into seeing women as not fully human and having their value contingent on whether or not they are worthy of said in an effort to draw attention to the ends up amplifying it publications might be trying to troll but some are just calling attention to it but inadvertently or not it ends up more problematic said opens up the vexing question of whether or not to feed the trolls wary of that framing as it comes with a undercurrent the message is you give them attention you get said suggests keeping a record of posts in case a situation escalates and then reporting the perpetrator where possible individuals should make up their minds about whether they mute or following safety guides like this one or this offers an alternative way to handle such by creating a to an explicit against these behaviors as opposed to repeating she said about taking more control of that so that the antagonist is no longer the center of the suggests the rest of the community can help here solidarity is asking how you can help is important basically trying to take a stand and say is not same behaviors that can marginalize and denigrate and traumatize can really bring a group making them feel good and paltry effort was to take a of the email and share it on twitter with a pithy comment mocking the sender it was not an act of fear or a cry for but an act of i am not intimidated by you and i am not alone the post triggered messages of support and wonderful jokes from friends and acquaintances that reminded me of all of the lovely people on the like choice very we might say that still in the early stages of settlement and that we will all start to become more civilized and others might rally to create better tools for tackling the abuse and real threats towards law a but not a fix the disproportionate harassment of people of color and queer people reflects underlying culturally embodied issues these are problems that exist being brought to attention in new and imaginative problems have nothing to do with the so the idea that we could have an solution is said need to deal with and mitigate systemic racism and sexism how do you get rid of rape the fact that women tell themselves stories to justify the horrible treatment they receive speaks to the depth of the cultural issues that underpin the free speech us and silicon valley in particular has a very specific libertarian view of free typified by john declaration of independence of which cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings to clamp down on harassment are frequently described as infringing on free especially in the us just people expressing their opinions no matter how sexist or unpalatable and so society appeals to the right to protect the words of certainly true that censorship is damaging to but the damage is taking place in the opposite direction you cede the floor to the most bigoted contributors that tends to marginalize and silence members of the group they are said leads to a reduction in the number of voices contributing to all in the name of free speech a more robust understanding of free speech is about trying to cultivate and protect the greatest amount of speech from the most diverse groups of people about having more people

knew i had been ready for it all my i knew i had been ready for it all my life a solution to rotting more than 1 million of us gathered in central square and together we felt strong enough to make a country where people would choose to joined the protests and spent day and night in the headquarters of the where it felt like the future of depended on whether our wooden shields would withstand the attacks of the government riot translated news into from the barricades and helped coordinate media efforts occasionally i would go home and sleep i opened my own to tell the story of what was happening i wanted to provide an alternative narrative for the one different from the press who branded us the and called us and three years i am left feeling that is treated as no more than a diplomatic pawn a country that has always been by both former soviet occupiers and modern global powers the western media also treats as an the that made relations with go sour but there are other stories to be like our citizens still having their rights oppressed and the daily information war we continue to fight with refuse to hate the people who want to separate from am originally from in

speaking and i grew up feeling that and were two countries with a common and culture but after the war i am no longer able to understand the situation as is so much propaganda trying to pit one side against the but i refuse to hate the people who want to separate from the rest of the from the i understand not that they think is just that they believed their lives would be better in think one day

navy after 32 years he used to listen to western rock music and travel the world now he believes and the terrible were great leaders who should have monuments erected in their i suggested was responsible for millions of he claimed that was a dictator has banned state on the basis of the disinformation and propaganda it promotes a move called a violation against freedom of speech but everything is available anyway my friend has just returned from the conflict in where he says no one only stuff from and the it feels likes is creating a fantasy narrative to destroy but for others a

hanging together since the work 35 , 000 have been questioned in depth about their views on discrimination and the state of our peter makes it about and are in trouble read remains a profoundly tolerant country but reports there is more anger is the air proportion of people who feel strongly negative is 2016 survey shows signs of fresh hostility to immigration and to multiculturalism the shifts are small but in the wrong direction and the survey indicates 6 million hold very or somewhat negative views of pollsters were in the field in and immediately after even commentators were talking about a revolt underway against the elites that was supposed to be transforming politics since become a finds little evidence of upheaval in this survey results attitudes are divided roughly along the same sort of lines as they are in all countries the ones who are going to be most disaffected are those who done as well in life as they would have he certainly not a mirror worrying

nation lately has quenched sunny feel they belong in reckon had a happy see as a land of opportunity where hard work brings a better are satisfied with their financial are confident their lives will

the foundation began its work nine years had seemed to be but one in five born abroad reported discrimination in 2016 they spoke of verbal and sometimes physical abuse not a finding to encourage wholesale repeal of protections from abuse in section of the racial discrimination the victims were the brunt of such only once or twice a year but for some it was a weekly occurrence the place of discrimination for a third of the victims was the workplace where they felt themselves being denied jobs or promotion because of their the 2016 survey also showed become a little less welcoming to people from different national or ethnic groups links this to a notable change in the numbers concerned about becoming victims of a big jump from in 2015 to in in a nation increasingly about the good

there are things structurally and within the culture of journalism itself that need to said thing readers can do is to read what and after that if you read something and have a strong reaction to read more about it rather than just accept what you originally read as complete only solution to according to is the human checking of facts would have to hire thousands of human beings who are trained to

orange juice and peppers his answers with laughter our conversation is a despite the horrors upon which it must first when memory is now reissued to accompany its sequel it is a small classic of holocaust literature with a light bringing events in and out of the author depicts his early years in where he was born in 1932 to parents who considered themselves culturally the move to and flight to his seclusion and conversion in a catholic his attempted escape to and their ultimately to die in it is a shattering written in 1977 in where went first to fight and later to salted with observations on the state and relations with the a debate in which he participates forcefully from the left where memory leads follows telling a painful story both personal and woven into discussions of teaching posts outside in and where he is emeritus professor of history at memory leads is a history in some of a book that contains more on his parents it was not until 1994 that he visited st where they were turned a trip made as he studied and the holocaust and about the two volumes of and the the years of persecution and the years of extermination those books took a lifetime to germinate and 16 years to culminating in his win am finished with historical research on this which has lasted my whole life it was a conscious decision i thought i had said what i had to mainly in these two which summed up what i was able to in a massive way i wanted really to spend the time that remained on literary topics because what i really next book will take as its genesis monsieur a memoir by the and will focus on kinds of memory the selections he made and the consistencies and but also the different tones and so childhood and the later social context and so why are we obsessed with the read the book is even work in work at its very in my as long as away from his desk in in the valley outside it will remain there his debt to is evident in every page that he writes in a review for the new for the historian sir praised the years of extermination as account of unparalleled vividness and power that reads like a so it sweeping the a factual war and peace this is in some part as because make extensive use of letters and journals from victims instead of sometimes unreliable testimony of that some of his techniques for the telling of so many stories are in fact more than in terms of the judicious making and placing of laughs nonetheless at the irony the traumatic past remains very much but nonetheless you have left the period yet i have written two volumes of yes it is a from the viewpoint there is a danger in many years after the event memoirs written immediately after the like that of of and others which were very close to the may be compared almost to diaries but and i know how far i could say it about my own with the passage of time one tends to the past traumatic past remains very much but nonetheless you have left the period you have spoken to many people about you have spoken to twitter outside his home in traumatic a mirror of 20th century wrought upon him change after change he was born in known as fled to he became hidden in the seminary in he became the catholic in in the army and working under he became an academic in and he became he speaks and writes in and thinks in his he homes in on similar catastrophic on diaries and letters written the face

states is preparing for power the us has lurched to the right a few weeks before our told a reporter that if trump were he might have to leave the he laughing this time with a touch of disbelief went around the world and i got even hate mail oh yeah telling why you leave and things like that i some were worse but i think like most people part our discusses the shortcomings of the decrying reliance on the of their own their own social the underestimation of appeal to ordinary to women and even he the resurgence of nationalism in the in under in but rejects a proffered link to conditions and events in the and is not he unable to conceive of an assault by trump on democracy itself a catastrophe and the more you see what inner circle is the more you get to wondering what can inner circle includes once of the news site soon to be white house senior presumed influence behind campaign ads and trump tweets that employed antisemitic tropes between and trump you know which is the worst appear to be close to the or to the he chose not to repudiate the endorsement of the or whatever on the one hand on the other hand accepted as his chief adviser when the man is well known for his absolutely obnoxious political and ideological views may show something of but i think he is as stupid as some describe him and if not then even because then he knows something of what he which is certainly with evil intent taking a man like that as an again in disbelief you going back to my wife and children are and i vote for he laughs again some people asked where will you so the first answer of course is but then between and trump you know which is the worst temptation to retreat is strong is too old to man the but he writes in where memory leads of a time living in he he had unconsciously built himself a version of his library in he came to he merely just vaguely among my not now the book to the rise of trump to journalists and audiences to talk to but with children and grandchildren scattered round the world and his second at his there is a sense of precious time his new he describes his working it involves writing having the resultant draft typed working over it in longhand again and thus simultaneously on content and i suggest this process could itself be seen as a metaphor for his work on memory and arguments effaced and written over but with traces and shadows remaining not an original gore used the term for such a as the title of his own likes the and says he must read he quickly pulls the conversation back from the empyrean to the quotidian in words to simple everyday life his second he is less literary than his a more conventional a recounting of history and the life of one who wrote it a section about the a quarrel among academics over the holocaust and how to remember the is a fascinating excursion into the politics of academia perhaps his delving back into this world explains the tribute to lodge in the title of one of the changing places the other is that just finds the campus novels very how drug abuse steered the course of history read he he writes as he now more more simply because he is old more literary efforts one of his first passes at writing when memory comes involved an attempt to summon a rush over a strawberry shake at a milk bar on the boulevard a drink remembered from his short time in with his in the late are simply too much to laborious way of does continue mainly because he never learned to went in he says of his first battle with writing his dissertation in in the early time reworking the

the autumn statement on will be the first time in 10 years will be nowhere in sight for a major fiscal event there will be many who breathe a sigh of relief at that alone but his presence will be heavily least as the budget last march contained a black hole as the decisions he had made for the previous six years started to catch up with him it also poses the first major test for the new i ask him a simple will you genuinely change course on the it is a simple yes or no but it defines the entire approach he takes to this autumn the vote taught us anything it is that many people are demanding change the chancellor and the prime minister may want to blame for our current economic plight as a recent leaked treasury document the damage to public finances was done before the referendum has simply exposed the fact that the last six years were wasted and that the economic policy they supported every step of the way has failed so many in our budget in march was a prelude to when the are set to fail by their own measure breaching their own fiscal targets set out in the 2015 conservative manifesto they said they would cap welfare spending and yet they have breached their own cap while punishing working families they said they would increase business investment with huge corporation tax but it is decreasing and companies are sitting on huge cash not most of all they have failed because they did not equip our economy for the challenges that poses the have no answers to meet the task i gave a speech in which i said we now need a positive approach to let me be clear i will continue to oppose a that is because the want to take a approach with a minuscule increase in infrastructure a pernicious immigration the destruction of workplace rights and environmental alongside a race to the bottom in taxes for the rich and in wages for the rest of us will oppose them every step of the way in parliament and insist on full accountability for their negotiating a i respect the referendum result not to do so would sow even deeper divisions within our society but that does not mean we cannot use the period of the negotiations positively to work with our social democrat and progressive friends in to construct a new relationship based upon and democracy has long argued that there are aspects of current single market regulations that should be reformed the negotiations provide an opportunity to work with partners to advance those such as state aid rules and enforced deregulation and will press the government to take up that opportunity we must move the debate on from the divisions of the referendum and bring people together we must look to the not the have no more a plan for our economy than they do for it is why their handling of the negotiations has descended into a shambles and why now making up deals factory by factory as the foreign secretary it looks like a will be a they still put the rich ahead of the rest of us by making working families pay for the giveaways to a wealthy few for of the population are getting a tax cut worth a year on while cuts to universal credit will leave more than two million families on average of a year worse was always a political not an economic necessity that is why we need an autumn statement that is on the side of working families and with polices that are equipping our economy for the autumn statement must meet three we need a credible fiscal which is crucial not just for the public finances but also to help us to invest in our economy so we can create jobs and growth the government should target a balanced current budget five years ahead and separate capital expenditure from spending to best do this they should replace the fiscal framework with fiscal credibility rule we would also set up a national investment bank with a regional banking network it would mean we could invest properly in our country and start to address regional the commitment to the has always been a media just like the the government is only paying lip service to people in the north of but it continue to just old it needs to deliver on them the fact that only one in five projects in the infrastructure pipeline is in construction shows that the government has not been meeting its own promises the rail electrification plan has been in the last few weeks and the government is failing to commit seriously to develop for the north of england wants to set up a of the so that we can channel the vital funding and investment that the region we need actual support for those in work on low and middle who will struggle as prices rise the chancellor can start by introducing a real living wage he needs to provide honest solutions to the childcare crisis he should reverse the giveaways to the wealthy and reverse those such as universal credit and employment and support to low and middle people are indeed about but that is directly due to economic policies that have a rich few over the rest of and left many in our country behind while a few at the top have soared we need secure and properly funded public services with the at breaking with a and social care in with one million people not receiving the care they there can be no more fudges on funding the same applies to local authority which has been cut at nearly every fiscal event under the the autumn statement needs to be ambitious for by a genuine change by not more cuts and half measures austerity should not be but ended once and for it will just provide further proof why only a government can ensure no one and no community is left statement on on via on on on on on this content
one day during his last year at primary drew a picture of a street in the city where he still lives the scene he drew had no people in but its representation of everything else suggested a talent beyond his happened to see the and said he wanted to put it up in the entrance hall that was an for someone who think they were any because been told they any every was asked to write his name on the an instruction that threw up a choice he had difficulties with and he knew his class teacher could be cruel i asked for i knew what he would he even spell his own what rubbish is so i did it teacher called to the front of the class went gave it to he held it up in front of the and then he tore it up he spelled his name wrong never be happened 45 years ago in recent has been treated for stress caused at least partly by that and how long it lived not just in his but in his understanding of the world and his place in it the story says a lot about the inhumanity that was once rife in the education but it also shines light on what like spending a lot of your life being not just but routinely insulted telling you no good every day worms its way inside your says you know all so this conflict going has known that he has syndrome to put it another that he is autistic ten minutes will tell you that condition comes down to a of to do with social communication and or what some people call of although the fact that is a prolific artist suggests in his that last criterion might be many diagnoses of autism have also included a range of sensory among them aversions to certain smells and as well as a deep dislike of sudden noise in these seem to blur into a complex kind of he understands music as something he can and experiences the yellow as a profoundly unpleasant like sometimes talks about his condition in front of an and there is one question that always comes up he sits in his room all he does he does complicated he talk to anyone else how do i make him you made his world one show it to you let him grow up thinking that the way thinking and what doing are was formally diagnosed at the age of at an clinic run as an offshoot of autism research after he was referred there by his the initial spark had been a meeting with the founder and in case anyone was of who had spoken with at the literature had begun to what sat under a lot of his at the the biography that accompanied his work as an artist included the words from may 2012 until he worked as the research immediately a specialist gave him his formal a process that involved an interview and something akin to a questionnaire got the letter saying i scored 18 out of 18 autistic and i had meet in a crowded near st cathedral in where he wryly comments on the mixture of clattering cups and muzak a lot of autistic this would probably be and casts his mind back over the 35 years he has been thinking about and researching autism he started working with six autistic children in a special unit in north in 1982 fifteen years he set up the research two years after in he opened a clinic dedicated to diagnosing autistic adults my son received a diagnosis aged three he had fixations with particular music or places traits i in was a growing awareness that autism just about he tells me was receiving more and more emails an but never fitted in might he have an adult go to a child and adolescent so where were they meant to if they went to a learning disability and they had an above be turned away so these people were like a lost generation that was a phrase i used a national autistic society estimates that there are currently around 700 , 000 people living with autism in the more than one in every 100 of the population some of these people have learning disabilities some are what the medical vocabulary terms or unable to speak others are a that includes those with the condition named after the paediatrician who in the worked with a group of children he famously termed syndrome is distinguished by the fact that people who have it display no language delay as toddlers or small children died in long before the term entered popular usage it has since been dropped from the relevant diagnostic but is still used in the is among this latter group that you will find many of the of autistic people currently thought to have been diagnosed as adults no national figures for adult autism diagnoses are but anecdotal evidence suggests numbers are tells me that four years 100 cases in were referred to his in the first four months of 2016 it received 400 of the terms used to describe autism do justice to the complicated traits bound up with it all its variants are covered by the term autism spectrum or people who dispute that autism is any kind of prefer the term autism spectrum condition the word was first used in this context by the pioneering researcher who died in 2014 she meant at the i was a spectrum within those who come to clinical attention where gone since is that this spectrum runs right through out into the general own interest in autism began when my son received a diagnosis of at the age of three back some things seemed the social distance between him and his his fixations with particular music the or his pointed dislike of some foods or sounds still curse whoever invented the public toilet his amazing facility with technology these things are simply part of the fabric of our shared life i echoes of myself in some of these traits the and of plenty of other more than his 10 years have brought me an understanding of the complexities of human both among those diagnosed as the and the everyday world has yet to catch up only of adults diagnosed with autism in the are in paid employment in 2014 team found that of the patients in their clinic had either felt suicidal or planned to kill and that a third had attempted to do so my this is nothing to do with autism or he says are secondary problems you came into the world with and the way the world or to you has led to a second which is depression and week after talking to i take the train to the town of to meet peter who got his autism diagnosis only 10 months ago he is an funny and says he loves perhaps a little too much get this deep urge a to talk to people when described it to the said like a bucket of water and full and then all of it comes and it twitter peter get too much for and they get too much for 20 it becomes clear that street has the most astonishing life story of anyone i have ever interviewed his he became pregnant with him when she was raped in his native the two of them were taken in by a man much older than who employed her as his and then married her and adopted street to give the arrangement a veneer of normality he grew he with no extended family and very few friends get too much for and they get too much for me a lot of the i overpower people when i was a when i made a i would go and sit on their waiting for them a really early and i cope with being late anywhere i used to go and sit on the maybe seven in the morning and people obviously like daily he often revolved around an outside and his back which he would use for solo games of football and marbles that was in some sense it have been wonderful for some but it was for he also made endless trips to the where he acquired a forensic knowledge of he mentions the musclebound actor who played can take certain things in really odd he says i take in what most people take in every he found it almost impossible to tune in to the teachers were shit with he says knew how to abuse they were good at it they were bullies they used to stand me in the in the and hit me over the head with the board to knock some sense into me always blamed my epilepsy on he started having grand seizures when he was it is now estimated that around a third of autistic people also experience though the relationship between the two is something that has yet to left school unable to read or write he passed through a series of jobs a a shop some of which came to an end because he found it difficult to process complex before settling into work as a gardener and gravedigger along the he married his with whom he has three grownup children like being with he says very very introverted in a a after breaking his neck while trying to climb into a transit van that was pulling street began three years in recovery while he was in he met a fellow patient who was an and started to work with him on his through adult he discovered a talent for we he hands me an anthology of his published in that begins with a poem titled not being a perfect glimpse into the autistic experience of not fitting the late street began to teach poetry in schools and day in the early he became a at the in which led to a series of assignments in he went to to write about the war that was then engulfing the with often said that they have no emotion or he says have too much too much empathy it broke my three experiences preyed on a meeting with an abandoned in a refugee an occasion when he gave his water ration to an emaciated woman with a newborn and the experience of eating a sumptuous meal in the town of with or four kids at the looking in and i have the balls to get up and go and give them my his inability to put away these memories had become too much went to a therapist and she want you to go and see a friend of mine a specialist in diagnosing people with i go as you do and she gave me these really strange games they were like a jigsaw four pieces white they were so i thought i could do them and i he was handed five plastic figures and and told to make a story with them i do either i connect them together into one story she said i was highly but on the autism response was one of enormous relief cried it was wonderful wonderful because all my life suddenly made sense and none of it the the abuse none of it was my fault apart from my family and put it in the top five greatest things that have happened in my life incredibly got her diagnosis of syndrome she is perfectly comfortable with the term when she was 30 back she was a regular user of the social networking site that was a forerunner of and and one of her contacts had begun to write about the process of finding out he was autistic wrote about it quite all the reasons gone for what the procedure was seeing half a dozen different psychiatrists before he found one who would refer him for she tells me the more he wrote about the more i was this is is now 35 she also has mild cerebral which manifests itself in spasms in her knees and wrists she is a whose specialism is the and has a punishing training schedule she wears a vintage bowie has a picture of the town of tattooed on her right and is a prolific and waspish presence on twitter is currently awaiting a decision on the funding of her which is focused on the relationships between academic libraries and digital academic social networking services and governance in research at secondary boys pretend to fancy you it kills because you take it grew up in in the dales and now lives in throughout her says she had a deep sense of being somehow being clever and being a supposedly interesting but never able to maintain friendships and saying something among women and girls is only starting to be properly understood the male to female ratio of autistic people currently stands at around although says he and other autism specialists are currently in a in their the actual figure may eventually turn out to be very different a whole new topic researchers are latching on about whether females for whatever reason might be better at hiding their he something that is borne out by recollection of her time at not supposed to get on with parents better than them when you go round to their houses i really want to play with people i just looked really aloof i read the diary of frank when i was and i talked about the holocaust but i would try to copy other how they talked and acted watch that other people watched so have something to talk about and home and she laughs got a when everyone else got but i had no interest in the teenage etiquette and the nastiness that often comes with it proved too much are cruel they exclude each and pretend to be friends with each as a game and i get but i get insincerity and at secondary boys pretend to fancy because the most ludicrous idea they can think of it kills you because you take it seriously and they invite you to and then they show or round the corner laughing all of that twitter penny would try

feel it quicker than other people i can feel it too much but i usually tell if people are trying to get out of a if people are trying to leave you have to tell need to i tell whether people like me or which is of people have issues with i myself included they seem at peace with it even with people known for a long i know whether they like me or not unless had an explicit you actually like which turns people it comes to understanding how much does she think the world still needs to a lot because i think a lot of people still believe or think a really mild it just makes it a bit harder for her to make makes her a bit more a lot of the stressful painful when the sensory stuff is like being mentions people flicking their train or jangling their or whistling not i have really but can you stop doing but people have one last question is what some people call when she meets autistic people who does she feel they are part of the same and i think we have a as people who can to make sure that those people are looked after and not and they have inappropriate people speaking for or saying things got a mental age of how would they if they communicate with from what i can they are experiencing the same thing as me when seen a person have a it looks like my only more physical it she thinks for a minute looks like an unrestrained version of how i sometimes talks about what many autistic people call like pretend interest in soaps and about managing to blend even if that means submerging whole chunks of your personality in passing took its toll in his late he hit an emotional wall being true to yourself has an effect on he says been and that had failed i had a girlfriend at the and that was failing i had a bit of a and it took me a couple of years to get used to started out on a new path as an artist the work he does ranges across disciplines including sculpture and and regularly touches on his own story among his most affecting works is a piece called my school an fountain pen covered in spikes that perfectly evokes his struggles as a child you might have but the basics of the way you view the world are right for he was working on a project with a group of teenagers for a charity called the foyer federation woman in charge you ever considered he recalls she gave him a copy of mark novel the curious incident of the dog in the now almost a set text for people interested in the condition i went away and i read one page and i wells up now might have faults and but the basics of the way you view the world are right for you when everybody tells thinking you know not but if tells you you think faulty the root of the depression and the low so to read those things on a page was emotional it was i could see that someone understood and i maybe i am it would

to the national autistic of adults say they get the help they need people might just about the more extreme but as penny puts probably not aware of the bulk of autistic people who are sitting coping with a lot of and the fact that dealing with all this noise and stress and uncertainty that they have among autistic adults speaks for itself even such mundane things as the ubiquity of piped or inadequate in public attest to the same basic a society averting its eyes from things that blight hundreds of thousands of lives and might easily be improved we of but the point needs to be greater

read talks a lot about the quintessentially autistic way in which he divines patterns in the often immersing himself in them music is a good example he has an called which he uses to sequences of electronic notes into an which he can then use if a spurt of anxiety means he needs to readjust he plays me a which i say reminds me of the kind of experimental music that came out of in the not a got really into tangerine dream in about 1976 the repeating sequences were heaven for says he also likes the electronic pioneers which rings loud bells my son is a and regularly in on particular segments of their songs and plays them over and over does that sound and his mind goes back to 1978 bought blue sky by there was a track on the other and it had a very strange beginning it was called fire on

my boss is bullying me and undermining my confidence but what can i do about boss like me not sure why and have given up trying to figure it but making my working life miserable she undermines me in front of the rest of the interrupts with irrelevant asides when trying to lead leaves me out of meetings i should be included and makes threats that i might lose my job or someone else more junior might lose theirs if i do some often irrelevant task i am desperate to leave but feel so undermined by her and passive aggressive that i feel useless and unemployable she likes to remind me that i am lucky to have a job i have worked here for 15 years but now feel trapped in a vicious circle what should i know why your boss like you and be fairly certain she either a and bullies are unhappy creatures who derive strange pleasure from humiliating particularly in front of an audience some bullies achieve their ascendancy through force of personality your boss does it by abusing her seniority in saying not asking you to understand let alone forgive saying something more the ultimate aim of bullies to intimidate their victims to such an extent that they begin to believe they somehow deserve to be that they are worthless beings and exactly happening to you you say you feel useless and and yet you must know none of those things in the 15 years worked in this place presumably before the arrival of this monster you will have been a contented person that at who you still are so you must fight very hard not to succumb if she senses you it will give her still further pleasure and even see it as in some way justifying her would hope that those in authority will soon the malign influence this person is having and will take steps to remove her but you wait for that you need to be consciously defiant defy your boss by looking at yourself in the mirror and promising yourself that you let her win then with all the old confidence that you can go out there and find yourself another say keep a detailed log of all and keep all relevant even notes my lawyer advised me this when i was in a similar situation it stop me from having to but i got a much better deal because i had proof of everything the only solution is to get out sad and but sometimes life is like that but you can look for other jobs up hill and down dale with no time pressure as an once you start looking you will probably find the stress flows away you will have control of the situation i was in this situation with a boss who continually described me as to cold to get along and i really in the feeling i was on the verge of a nervous i simply quit i have anything to go to but felt i had to for the sake of my health i had savings i could live on for six months big lifestyle a plan for work if i find something and an alternative plan for retraining in the longer term the day i walked out was one of the happiest of my life the relief was incredible and i felt much better about myself almost immediately in the end i got a job within a month only in hindsight that i just what a bad mental state got myself and i dread to think of the damage if i had stayed i know it is a

desperately have recently been promoted to team the second rung of the managerial ladder i had been working towards this for a year before i finally got my opportunity on secondment for two months and will get made permanent if it goes explained in my interview that although i have a basic knowledge of the computer i have the knowledge that the other team leader or the manager has since i have been promoted i have had to text or ring one of them each shift in order for help i explained that i wanted training and needed it to be able to do my but have been told going to be difficult to find the time now things are going wrong and i am unable to fix them there have been occasions where they answered the phone and been completely and been reprimanded for it on the next this continues i see the secondment being made from either as i want to take the job permanently if this is what is to suspect being just a little too polite and hesitant because you want to make a fuss or seem to be looking for excuses when things go you been nearly firm enough in your request for training this could lead to exactly the outcome you with your secondment failing to be made permanent and rather than your being held responsible you as you be relieved but that would be unfair and need to write a considered note to your copied to hr you have such a avoid sounding either plaintive or stick strictly to the facts say that you are grateful to both your manager and the other team leader for the time they spend helping you deal with system issues now that been doing the job for some time become even more

people talk about using electronic tagging to track goods including that meat but i just cannot see how that would work if we were to leave the customs union then a hard border even for those

democratic deficit will not by what happened on 23 those people in need to look at the the the the of this who have led them down a garden path into a very very unpleasant forest of anything she is even angrier with the opposition benches greatest betrayal of the liberal left in this country is by the party the profoundly peculiar thing at the moment is that the two most liberal on the subject of who will stand up without fear and make the positive case for are and in the face of from the party the who i know agree with but are literally caught between constituents who voted overwhelmingly to and a and bobtail of all sorts of who might terrified they speak up for immigration absolutely pathetic left it to an old like me to do will come as no great surprise to anyone that is routinely

because of what he said about the i follow why this constitutes a justifiable nor if it she also dislike and martin too i she goes on is feels on firmer ground with the media taken leave of its senses hysterical headlines are afraid just becoming acceptable i think the daily mail is just appalling at the she has nothing but praise for sensible face of our and is a big fan of the current campaign to persuade advertisers to boycott newspapers that print xenophobic smears against emotional rather than factual got to stop you can be passionate about something but still have a reasoned debate based on fact and and not this horrible way the media and politicians are conducting themselves appalling lost the art of and we need to get it back concerned that now acceptable for people to say things

man in the east midlands who told her that you no longer hear anyone speaking in had enough of i looked him straight in the eye and crap and you know i i know and crap of course you hear people speaking overwhelmingly speaking in and you could see him absolutely she snorts of course but become acceptable to say and people being challenged so i challenged by now she is jabbing a finger at me and her eyes are burning he but but yes right but they hang around on street corners drinking and i heavy with because of people do do and you could see he was of course you i was challenging how you win this of us of probably wish more people had won that argument but admits because she voted for the referendum she shares some of the blame for the constitutional fiasco we now find ourselves in she had been in of holding a referendum because i thought we would win obviously i have been if i thought we would be like everyone failed to notice the legal flaws in the which only came to light when the high court ruled that consent was required to trigger article people should be cross people should be cross and i feel very guilty about that we voted for the referendum act without understanding the consequences of a leave vote we told people it was but now we and quite concerning that none of these things were explored before parliament decided all of our faults all of us every single one of she has come to the decision that she will vote for article 50 made up my but made up my mind you need to be very clear about because quite agitated that people say going to thwart blah no why did it take her so long to because my other argument is that against everything i believe so why vote for i told people that if we voted we would and i go back on that so taken me time to get to this having made up her mind that this is the right thing to would she think it illegitimate for any other to vote against article no up to entirely up to them i would not condemn any whichever way they in vote might turn out to be moot if is right about her next point the government is appealing against the high court but at the supreme court the government will argue that the consent of is also required to trigger article 50 thinks it has a strong case reliably informed that the act 2016 section 2 says that you cannot interfere with devolved they must be determined by the as seems were to block article what would happen in a terrible constitutional crisis we are on the verge of a constitutional crisis the likes of which we have not we i find myself wondering what is like when she so terrifically angry hard to but i have a feeling she might be tremendous fun when the opportunity to find out might come is as it is difficult to see the current mess being resolved to her satisfaction i does she see events panning the nothing would surprise me if told me 19 months ago that i would get would have won a would be the leader of the we would have left the and trump would be i think i

gain junior followed suit with a video tweet that has since between more than 260 , 000 times from the song and the challenge blew up twitter the short version for young people who engage with viral trends on a daily to explain its trajectory in this way is completely unnecessary for those who do the whole thing can sound like another language one that the music industry is scrambling to emailed and a few questions their answers were about as cheerfully brief as you might expect from a couple of teenagers with far better things to be doing wrote it for they reply when i ask if the idea of becoming a viral was in their minds when the song came about and i was more important in making it go the song or the are very in other they are not particularly interested in dissecting the

a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the 45th president of the united states of for feminists desperate to see the first female the result was how could someone with such disregard for rights become trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is and by the end of the race 12 different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face form of for having before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes women by the experts and many predicted that lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their to exit of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in of by six percentage points by of black women and of voted for some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women so offended by misogyny that they voted for en mass we interviewed women across to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists what they a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own worker who lives in the much state of voted for trump she describes herself as socially financially independent and educated female i either friends or except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy truly thought video of as been having two and a i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own choices thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities thought it incredibly hypocritical to him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill is and helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this change my opinion about except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a including the presidency was not clear as to what her policies as president would except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe plans for job creation benefits including minority groups i also and have for a long to a more isolationist foreign not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or trump voter a mother of two boys who is currently not calls herself a feminist most but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of a mix of farmland and more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump some things i would be a feminist but it mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality the end of the day video of did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does matter in those senses because looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day all sinners and we all say things like this it uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal even husband had an affair at the end of the my sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media or maybe just simply paid by to make her criminal issues look not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race there is nothing other than whether they can run the country or a which naturally lends itself to traditional twitter republican nominee was knocked out of the presidential heather brown backed trump brown believes that under trump the us economy will prosper and the average will be able to succeed in areas where they are currently home work and finance she says that trump the misogynist reported to really just felt like they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality bias politics can be unscrupulous it demands you constantly remember that behind every door lives a pushed agenda you are

got a lot more airtime than who was polite and played by the rules was too quiet for a nation that chases tornadoes and is captivated by blazes failings him and make him a lot more riding on this

the conservative former work and pensions has urged ministers to abandon planned cuts to universal credit worth speaking in a commons he said that this was a subject to my and that work allowances the amount people can earn before losing universal credit were crucial he went if we really want to see the right thing happen to people out there who try and get into work and stay in the allowances are critical and i would recommend and hope that my colleagues in government will think very carefully again about the decision to reduce those allowances i the problem with the deficit and of course we want to reduce and not asking for more money asking for wiser spending of the money have a very good opportunity now to do something that is really and bold and right for those that we really want to improve the lives which the prime minister rightly said was her target group it is a very conservative thing to do to help people who are doing the right thing to improve their smith said if the government cannot reverse the proposed cuts for everyone affected it should single parents and the disabled he went i urge my my to do just it is the right thing to it will be the thing to do that changes lives and improves the quality of those was speaking in a debate on a motion saying the proposed work allowance cuts and a cut to employment and support allowance disability should be reversed motion has just been underestimated the strength of the leave vote in the referendum because they failed to pick up the extent to which the less educated were prepared to back a leading polling expert has said professor john whose exit poll in the 2015 general election was the first to indicate an overall conservative victory said the way people voted in the referendum was different to the way they vote in general elections as the press association he told a briefing by social there was a very substantial difference by education in willingness to vote leave or remain this was a referendum which was essentially between the social liberals and the social conservatives in our which is rather different division from the one the opinion polls are usually trying to which is between left and right that is a division which is much more around class than around education exiled islanders will not be allowed to resettle on the the government has announced in a commons written statement sir a foreign office the manner in which the community was removed from the territory in the and and the way they were was wrong and we look back with deep regret we have taken care in coming to our final decision on noting the emotional ties to ocean and their desire to go back to their former way of comprehensive of work included an independent feasibility study followed by a full public consultation in the and the am today announcing that the government has decided against resettlement of the people to the ocean territory on the grounds of and security and cost to the taxpayer in coming to this decision the government has considered carefully the practicalities of setting up a small remote community on islands and the challenges that any community would face these are and include the challenge of effectively establishing modern public the limited and education that it would be possible to and the lack of economic particularly job prospects the government has also considered the interaction of any potential community with the us naval support facility a vital part of our government will instead seek to support improvements to the livelihoods of in the communities where they now live i can today announce that we have agreed to fund a package of approximately over the next ten years to achieve this parliament is to seek expenses from independence campaigners who camped out on its grounds after spending more than on legal action as the press association the group were evicted from the site earlier this month after losing an appeal against their removal the parliament spent of public money on the legal including more than on the petition for the removal and more than fighting their unsuccessful appeal all from me for for the comments another is which was set up as a progressive remain campaign during the and which was backed by has put out a statement this afternoon the shadow chancellor john for being too willing to accept in his speech yesterday the national a member of steering we would not support using parliament to directly block but what is the point of our having the right to vote on article 50 if they do not use it to extract concessions against hard must champion the progressive elements of free the environment and human rights doing this is not about betraying the will of the people it is about opening up the negotiating process to public scrutiny and doing it effectively means retaining parliamentary leverage over article group also for saying in his speech that opposing or even delaying article 50 would place the majority will of the people and on the side of certain corporate who have always had the people at the back of the another is we are at a loss to know what kind of political strategy involves condemning your own people as corporate against will of the at a time of rising nationalism and right wing populism this choice of language is irresponsible and wrong the overwhelming majority of members backed remain they were

her critics say is the lack of one as peter walker may repeatedly insisted that she and her ministers were devising a coherent plan for exiting the but would not share details before negotiations began after the asked about comments by the foreign that the would probably leave the customs union but retain some access to the single may right gentleman seem to understand that the customs union is not just a binary the focused his questions almost entirely on and argued that the government was a total of has expressed in prof the chair of the child abuse inquiry she was speaking at after the mp asked about the and report saying another lawyer working there has has refused to say whether the government has discussed giving a peerage to the outgoing leader the asked if there have been any official conversations on this topic and may all i can say to is that such matters are normally never discussed in a spokeswoman for may would not comment on whether might get one but you will have heard the prime minister talk in about her views on the system and making sure that it people who really contribute to society and their was a slightly odd answer because peerages are no longer supposed to be given out as they are given to people who will contribute to the and the argument for giving a peerage is based on the fact that have only three peers in the lords not people appointed as despite coming third in terms of vote at the general the lib have 104 peers may has refused to condemn proposal to ban from entering when the mp tommy asked about may said that the would the dignity of our but that it was to the us what rules they put in she also said she wanted the special relationship to overwhelming majority of voters want to continue to trade freely in goods and services with its after quitting the according to a survey but seven out of 10 think the should be able to limit the number of citizens coming to live and work in the country something leading politicians say is not compatible with the single market membership required to permit free trade as the press association forced to choose between the two voters questioned by social research opted by the narrowest of margins for immigration with thinking freedom of movement for citizens should be kept if it enables the to keep free and opposing it senior research fellow professor john said the

international development had given the impression that aid was being phased may no longer have a traditional aid relationship with these countries but it is spending development in and china and it is rather diffident about admitting the review by the independent commission for aid impact found such about legitimate activities in these had given opportunities for it politicians from all parties must out of their tribal and forge a new centrist home for voters who are about the direction may is taking the country in the wake of the paddy has urged and this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about on but more than martin win martin win for bad for may latest for reaction the daily verdict on heated failed to dent the lines could be quite effective if deployed by a more nimble debater but may can just attack him for incompetence every the morris of better outings in recent questions on government 's the so far on sharp form by sticking to the one topic and reminds he said it would be a success the peter walker may needs a new writer for her jibes at sounding a bit flat these all relative of but no doubt that is getting better at the financial of better he asked thorny questions on current issues but may effectively hit back on leadership the watch much anymore but who is this person who looks like he 's pretty good at the new has a long way from punch and back 5 and rare view of from commentary box going for it 2016 that was not an especially memorable as i argued it was one that saw expose some of the weaknesses in the position the point there is no agreed reasonably effectively may will not be losing any sleep about this but poll findings on how the government is handling ought to generate at least a little concern in downing street the main thrust of response was that i the splits in her government are nothing compared to the divisions on in the shadow cabinet in the chamber this attack line did not really but may is right to say there are tensions in on this subject in his economy speech yesterday john the shadow indicated that the party would oppose any move to demand a second referendum on the even though some are in and the party conference passed a motion calling for a second referendum the lawyer and has written a strong today tactics this has not erupted as a row but at some point in the future it might as i missed the question from the leader at because i was writing up a snap verdict so here is a quick summary he started by asking about the institute for government analysis saying the plans are and may the most important thing for this government to do is calmly and carefully get on with the job of preparing for complex negotiations and one of the most important things we can do is not give a running then asked about statement about how the would probably leave the customs union may said that the issue of whether to leave the customs union or remain in it was not a and she said that only two years in the independence the wanted to take out of the single market says the port of in his constituency benefits from free trade with says the common travel area with started in 1923 she says the government the importance of keeping it the asks if there have been any official discussions about giving a says such matters are normally never discussed in public a asks if may will reverse the rule saying prisoners could be released halfway through their says this is an issue that was of concern when she was home secretary what is important is to rehabilitate she says the asks what the government will do to ensure social media companies are held to account for facilitating says the home office is aware of this issue it is best addressed by the terms and conditions of the companies themselves a asks what may will do to improve trade with says she wants to discuss this with trump at very early says the child abuse inquiry has lost three chairs and eight senior lawyers and there are senior allegations that have gone she says may says it is important that the inquiry must continue having seen the work prof jay did in she has absolute confidence in her ability to run the inquiry the conservative chair of the says the is planning to end its monitoring service if it does that would be a he says he says it only costs says the government how important this service foreign is for the government the government is talking to the about she says asks may to bring about parity for people with dementia for says the government has set a target to increase the number of dementia and investment is going up but the government is committed to improving care a says his parents are they have been here 50 but have never can may assure him he will never be asked to vote for them to says she wants nationals to be able to stay but she must protect the rights of living in countries she says she hopes they can reach a deal an early
since becoming the us trump has left some people worrying about their rights he has vowed to roll back on abortion freedoms and deport millions of illegal immigrants with criminal records he has also appointed who has been a as white house chief of the liberties being challenged were fought for and won in the the liberation for battled for abortion to be made legal happened in the in 1967 and the us in in the civil rights led by martin campaigned for racial equality and against how do those who stood up for these freedoms feel about we spoke to activists in the us and the about the and whether they believe what they battled for is now at risk we also asked their advice on dealing with political uncertainty and standing up for what you believe interview includes an assistant to martin who fought for the civil rights movement at he was sentenced to 34 years in prison for alongside nine other black men the conviction was later from am opposed to cynicism too much of that about the election i believe that there are more people in the us than there are those of the i worked with martin king and the southern leadership and later i worked with the national association for the advancement of colored people in the we struggled for voting civil rights and housing rights and we were but our success also brought a reaction how republican candidate got elected in he ran on a law and order campaign so fast forward to today and president election in 2008 in a a of martin king but after eight years it has brought a reaction every time you make progressive steps forward there is a reaction so i am not disillusioned by recent events i understand the counterbalance of not just in the us but also in the trump has both now an opportunity and a responsibility to lead rather than backwards i believe that there are more people in the us than there are those of the same in and but the problem is that people of have to exercise their participation in civic engagement we had a low voter turnout in us this year and when that happens it opens the door for a reaction rather than a more progressive move forward as i i am concerned but not disillusioned because i believe the forces of history will always move towards equality and freedom as we say in the is a constant struggle if you want freedom you have to always stand up for it and push for you cannot just relax twitter civil rights leader martin king with his and colleagues during a civil rights march were a period of social transformation but to make changes you also need to transform the consciousness of people and what we have to work at now i hate cynicism and too much of that about the election result we have to deal with what happened from a much more optimistic perspective in the when we shall we were not overcoming but we sang it because that was our hope and desire we must continue to do to show we are overcoming and setbacks there will always be setbacks and struggle the question is whether we are willing to overcome from next four years are a time to hunker down and grew up in about a mile from i went to mainly populated by white students there was a lot of racism at the time in and the south as a but where i lived was more diverse and although it was felt that black people should stay in their own views changed based on two the 1968 candidacy was a national spokesman for resistance to racial and the assassination of martin king that same year the strength of support and the riots in and other cities brought the grievances of black people to the at least for me my cause was the war movement twitter segregationist politician addresses a 1976 rally in in he attracted of the vote and won five southern states my over the all the movements rights and civil gradually effected changes in policies but effect a change in the mindset of many of the who had supported those policies in 1968 of voted for and i assume that all of them to some racist i would not be at all surprised to find that of are still racist that they all voted for while women have gained there is still a large group of men who are more comfortable with men in charge and issues such as access to abortions still create major sexist voting blocs for i believe that most actual rights that i fought for in the are believe that most actual rights that i fought for in the are but regulations will be sent back to the states who will use them to curtail abortions and push down black turnout immigrants who are here illegally will be deported by the millions until employers make a stink a ban on immigrants pass even a trump supreme court police presence in cities will climb and police shootings will continue but not like police officers are currently being convicted for killing unarmed suspects the next four years are a time to hunker down and protests will only serve to the and give trump someone to blame for his policy failures from east in the and there was less inequality and people were was 16 in 1970 as a young i was involved in the youth wing of the party i was mainly involved in the trade union i helped to get the policy of gay rights equality on to the trade union policy book in 1977 i also campaigned to improve rights and fight for equal pay there was a huge amount of optimism back then we felt like we were moving the agenda forward and changing the but of course all that was trashed when thatcher came to power she dismantled rights since successive governments have taken it apart further if my younger self could see the world he would was all that effort worth of my life has been spent under regimes that are officially or nominally but when we started getting political we hoped this be the we wanted progress there has been progress in some not all doom and less war and tackled major diseases the way we treat one another in public life and the relationship between state and citizen has got markedly worse union rights have gone backwards and been huge growth in inequality back in the and there was less inequality and people were happier as a result there was a feeling we were all going in the same direction and part of a big enterprise if my younger self could see the world he would was all that effort worth i would like to see the young fight now like we they after the ones affected by all the decisions made today people need to get out there and not just about from we fought for seems to be being the late i was passionately interested in ideas and even though i was very young i went on the big war demos and i was a somewhat naive member of the young communist league in the i was into feminism and rock against racism always been firmly on the that changed at all utterly terrified and appalled by the lurch to the right the latent racism and xenophobia emerged and been whipped into a frenzy by the media is highly dangerous and any hopes and beliefs i had that we were making slow and painful progress towards a better working model of human community and progress are in tatters i fully understand why happening and i feel powerless to change it working on fear is stultifying and must be overcome if the left start fighting back it could get unspeakably 67 from wish you younger people had made your voices heard there was the big war demo in 1968 i went to the rally in square but i join the march on the us embassy later i heard that it ended in serious violence and people being and i was glad i gone because i was and still a pacifist twitter war demonstrators run past downing 27 1968 from biggest issues we were fighting for were an movement and civil rights black had been fighting for their civil rights ever since the days of and the civil war and still those rights were being denied them in immigration from the and later from and and had been met with fear and prejudice among the indigenous white working class whose homes and jobs they were seen as taking now needed to ensure the civil rights of black people this did become something of a generational as the older generation who had struggled through the depression and then had to fight for their country in the second world war had a sense of entitlement to the jobs and security they had fought for and resented having to share or sometimes even lose them to foreign think the rights my generation fought for are being at least not so far they have actually become orthodoxies i think and trumpery are the manifestations of a rebellion by the new alienated and dispossessed i wish you younger people had made your voices heard more after you are the ones who have inherited the mess my generation have evidently so who are we to start advising from believe humanity will i was in high school in a comfortable i was a member of the young socialist the youth group to the socialist workers party mostly my work focused on rights and ending the war i did at night leaflets to telephone the precursor to one of my first paid jobs was at the abortion action alliance i remember the power of mass movements the thunder of protest voices marching down new city the feel of the nubby grass underfoot as you ran from one part of the demonstration in to another i remember folk music being baked into our lives a lot blue jeans were so was hair sue and her we are in an urgent situation with the i am very worried about saving our environment that needs to come first especially because i have a i worry about rights to control our own bodies because of the views towards people who are not i also worry about fascism and history repeating itself i worry about the economy the overwhelming majority of us no longer know the how to use the soil to create how to care for others when they are sick and i worry that the old need to survive will lead us into war but i have a powerful belief that when you have lost everything that is when the beginning comes and we will have a new we will learn from one another humanity will elections rights on on via on on on

penguins and said manager of marine species and threats a new fur seal at the colony near before the quake destroyed breeding grounds doc said that it was likely some new fur seals may have been killed when a landslide squashed their protected breeding grounds at university associate professor of marine science said although the loss of breeding grounds would be a cause for a drop in seal the new fur seal population was steadily and he expected the point population would soon establish new breeding grounds as female seals would need to beach to give birth in the coming is some evidence that seals could have felt the tremors before humans did and fled to the water before the so possibly quite a few said the upward revising of earthquake from 7 5 to 7 8 might not seem but it means more than the 0 3 difference might handy calculator at the us geological survey shows that a magnitude 7 8 earthquake is nearly twice as big as a 7 5 a 7 8 quake is 2 818 times in terms of energy than a immediate effect could be that aftershocks could persist for longer and be stronger than had been expected the revised magnitude of 7 8 makes this the largest earthquake in new since the dusky sound quake of 2009 also a the remote location at new in the national park meant there were no recorded casualties and few to dusky new largest quakes were the of 1929 and the bay earthquake of 1931 both of

breeding colonies for has slipped away 2016 which had originally recorded the at 7 5 has posted a statement on the new 7 8 rating it indications are that this is one of the most complex earthquakes ever recorded on land this complexity means we have had to take extraordinary efforts to determine the and locations to the size of the gathered data from our entire network of seismic stations all of these stations would not normally need to be included in magnitude our techs at went out to several sites which we lost communication with and we have now been able to upload this so we have a more complete understanding of the ground deformation and our science teams have been working going up and down the affected areas and measuring the length of faults and how much they moved their efforts have provided us with a clearer picture as to the size and length of the on all these ongoing we can say with some confidence that the earthquake was an is consistent with estimates from several other international specifically the their early model provided us important information and we used all our additional data sets to confirm the magnitude the acting minister of civil also offered an update on the evacuations from the will this evening set sail to port town close to with about 390 evacuees from on ship is expected to arrive around depending on weather conditions and the amount of time it

magnitude of has been revised science informed my office of the revised magnitude earlier today after reassessing the data from its stations across the it took over a minute for the fault to rupture during this the standard method normally used to calculate the energy released during an earthquake was revised magnitude just tells us what anyone who felt the earthquake would already know that it was a powerful tremor that lasted for a long does not change what happened or how central government or local authorities responded it simply provides us with more knowledge about how significant this earthquake expected with a larger the revised magnitude does have an effect on the probabilities of forecast meaning it is now forecast that aftershocks may be larger in magnitude for a longer period of time reports had varied on the strength of the initial quake that struck shortly after midnight on own monitoring had measured the earthquake as magnitude 7 5 what we at the guardian have been using in our reporting up to other including the united states geological already had it at how described the discrepancy on have currently established that the new local magnitude for this earthquake is but this may be reviewed over time when more detailed research is undertaken this may bring it closer to the value by the us geological has now the government has confirmed the new government has officially upgraded the magnitude of earthquake from 7 5 to 7 8 evacuations from with hundreds of people mostly tourists who have been trapped since the town was cut off from road access now being

countries to sign up to the regional comprehensive economic its own version of trump proved to be a real isolationist and walked away from open trading and imposed trade he might imagine this that would protect workers and bring jobs home but empirically we know this just tends to lead to higher inflation and and job losses we do have cause to worry that without to defend and promote a liberal global trade and investment economic damage and impoverishment would spread through the global does believe that would benefit from targeted infrastructure spending but less impressed by tax as mainly benefit the better irony of trump 's of his tax cuts go to the top only to bottom my chart the other big worry is that trump could drives up the us national debt to alarming the other major concern about is about a mishandled fiscal expansion and unfunded tax cuts that would entail a substantially wider fiscal deficit and more rapid expansion of public debt the bipartisan and independent committee for a responsible federal budget has calculated that what little we know of including repeal of could put about trillion on to the outstanding level of public now standing at by federal debt would rise from 80 to over 105 per cent of increasing the us ratio of debt to from about 77 per cent to at least 105 per cent once debt levels exceed 90 100 per cent of economic growth becomes seriously major risk then is that after an initial economic the us becomes mired again in rising public deficits remember debt will be rising anyway in the because of and social security spending since the external deficit would probably deteriorate as the likelihood is that economic higher inflation and interest a falling and then an economic downturn might ensue and if trump is keen to push

financing this debt will absorb a much greater share of federal revenues over time in the 50 years before the financial the average interest rate paid on federal debt was but the average ratio was just a average interest rate on a debt equal to of would be ruinous the truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally if that that the wider us economy need a stimulus boost right the economy for all intents and at full employment the overall unemployment rate is lower than it has been of the time over the past 50 years while the unemployment rate is lower than it has been of the time over the past 50 supporters might question this rosy view of the us economy especially in the rust belt where manufacturing jobs have been lost and wage growth pegged down but if the fiscal stimulus might not actually regenerate economy at all construction but not sparking a manufacturing in this a shock boost to aggregate demand through tax cuts would likely boost inflation and imports more than domestic since the economy is constrained higher inflation and bigger deficits should lead to higher interest rates particularly if the federal reserve perceives inflation risks as having risen and so raises interest economy is more like a healthy tortoise than a sickly hare immigration reform designed to skilled immigrants or policies that boosted productivity growth might give the

destitution by must be losing their touch normally you would expect a comment like this to trigger a statement from saying this shows wants to increase spending on benefits by x gazillion but i heard anything from them so said would oppose any moves by the to expand the role of private insurance in welfare alarm bells should ring on moves to expand the role of private insurance into the social

not to attend the emergency meeting of foreign last night to discuss election the spokeswoman sidestepped questions about whether may would be to trump for some of the things her aides and ministers said about him during the campaign asked about a possible the spokeswoman responded instead by stressing that may had had a good phone call with trump and that trump had talked about the warmth of the transatlantic relationship the spokeswoman played down suggestions that may felt the embassy in had not done enough to forge links with the trump campaign asked about those the spokeswoman said she did not them she said may had welcomed the work diplomats had done in spokeswoman played down suggestions that trump was a threat to asked about she said the pressing threats to were those that were well such as the risk from and the prospect of aggression she also said that the government agreed with trump about the need for countries to increase their spending if they are not meeting the target of spending of on remains thinks article 5 is an of the the spokeswoman said article 5 is the collective which says that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all during the election

like to see the bust back in the oval office the spokeswoman said that trump did not raise this when he spoke to may on but that if team put in a it would be considered issue is something of a red herring as this mirror article the white house already has a bust of its spokeswoman brushed aside claims that people should be worried about election asked if may understood why people were alarmed about the prospect of him becoming the spokeswoman prime minister thinks that this was a choice made by the people her focus is on how we bring a strong relationship government still believes that invoking article 50 would be the spokeswoman said last week it was reported that the government may tell the supreme court that the article 50 taking the out of the could be contrary to what the government argued in the hearing that led to the high court deciding parliament must vote on article 50 being invoked the supreme court will hear the appeal next month asked if the government still thought invoking article 50 was the spokeswoman that has been our position and remains our view 10 downing street back images the number 10 lobby briefing is over there were a lot of questions about

would hope that some in the government could do the same thing i would be very happy to provide introductions and to start the necessary process of mending fences and i would not want anything in

after the mayor of is hosting a social integration conference at city hall today he said there is evidence that lack of social integration costs the economy clear evidence has also shown that a failure to promote social integration increases the fear of encourages damages restricts social mobility and increases city hall said in a news a statement khan we have seen major political upheaval around the world in recent with the referendum here in the and the presidential election in the has shown how politics is becoming more and more with whole communities in cities across the world feeling increasingly disconnected and estranged from national politics why more than we need to build a strong sense of social solidarity within our cities a renewed sense that we are united as and citizens we need to see real leadership in cities across around the world if we are to avoid communities becoming increasingly divided promoting social integration means ensuring that people of different social backgrounds and generations just tolerate one another or live but actually meet and mix with one another and forge relationships as friends and as well as citizens we know that when this trust communities flourish and become more healthier more prosperous for everyone khan in his today interview sir the conservative former foreign urged may to try to influence trump in the way that thatcher influenced he the immediate in a sense and i want to exaggerate this but it is to try and do with trump what thatcher did with thatcher was able to persuade as to the need to have with and because she was the iron lady he listened to her in a way that he have listened to anyone issues are different at the moment the issues at the moment are rather dismissive comments about think as prime as a leading member of the alliance the most important military power after the united states is in a unique position to actually explain and discuss with trump why the commitment to come to the of particularly in the event of of the is crucially important and while on the subject of a has a long profile of him at today he says foreign policy experts dislike him intensely foreign policy experts to find him a reprehensible figure one former whom i had always imagined to be a man of said of push him off his bike if i saw him in the experts least those who have not actually worked with accuse him of of of content in his vapid on seeing foreigners as raw material for belief that he can bullshit because very and height of irresponsibility for drawing up no plan for he is the version of trump has long been scorned by his opponents as a but now they hate him for having persuaded the people to vote has made a good impression at the foreign says on first day at the he addressed the entire staff he was then asked what lunch he would like to be brought to him in his grandiose room he went instead to the a practice he has continued and which people really notice hierarchy is tempered by quantities of paper descend on a foreign but calls in the officials who produce the paper and talks to them he wants the people who work for him to enjoy an instinct which not all ministers or are capable of one official puts foreign office is like a if you show it a bit of it will be eternally loyal and has tickled its tummy very has arrived in for meeting of foreign ministers on his way in he told reporters that election could be good for and i think there is a lot to be positive about and it is very important not to prejudge the or his only a few days since the election has taken place i think we all need to wait and see what they come up with but i think we should regard it as a moment for is a time as the prime minister is saying a big change going on in the people who feel they been properly listened properly are starting to make their voices heard it is up to up to to listen to them and to take things forward in a positive trump is a and i think that could be a good thing for but it could also be a good thing for and that i think is what we need to focus on today at the foreign affairs council in today seems to be taking the view that it is best to judge trump by what he does as not by what he said during the election campaign that is given that within less than a week of his election trump is already diluting some of his key but cynics would point out that himself has a particularly keen insight into implausibility of campaign promises given all the time he spent on vote for the bus the foreign chose not to attend a dinner of foreign ministers last night to discuss the election of trump it has been described at one point as an emergency meeting the foreign ministers are meeting anyway today and made his views clear on when he told colleagues time that we snapped out of the general doom and gloom about the result of this election and collective that seems to be going on in some the today this morning dame the former foreign said decision to boycott the dinner was a mistake she told the i think i would have perhaps playing down its significance in terms of the but i think i would have gone because over the next couple of years is going to need all the help and all the friends in it can if we are to get a good and i would not have thought it is a good idea to alienate sir the former conservative foreign said made the right decision very relaxed about decision i think it is rather unnecessary to treat the election of a united states president as an emergency requirement when we yet know for certain what trump is going to be has a good account of the dinner an idea it instead of offering a display of unity against the of once again put its divisions front and center by the time the ministers finally sat down the start of the dinner was delayed because showed up late many of the participants just wanted to get it over with the meal ended soon after 10 an early evening by with the larger question of how to deal with a under leadership nowhere closer to being resolved is still trying to come to terms with the election of trump as president may will set out some of her thinking in her mansion house speech this previewed but the times and the daily telegraph are both splashing on reports saying some are unhappy about decision to rule out using the leader as an intermediary both papers quote what lord a peer and former minister and former government trade told radio 5 live yesterday anything we can do at any level to rebuild that relationship the will be to and if happens to be one of the people who encourages that relationship then so be it any manufacturer would use its best salesman to try and help get a market for them and if no 10 decides that the then times front split over role in deal with telegraph front under fire for dismissing alliance with is a relatively obscure and most other who are speaking to reporters on this are doing so but has decided to stir things up with an article in the daily telegraph in which he says number 10 has to with trump discussing his meeting with trump and his team on we talked to all of the key players in team and perfectly clear that to a man and woman they are we talked about the prospect of the united kingdom being at the front of the all of which was met only slight negative i picked up was the sense that so many senior conservative figures and indeed important staff figures who now work in no 10 had been so unrelentingly negative about the there are fences to be there will be more on this as the day goes is the agenda for the day the shadow work and pensions gives a speech on social security for the goes on trial accused of murdering the mp 10 lobby briefing the education takes questions in the the foreign is attending a meeting of foreign ministers in where election will be i will be covering the breaking political news as it as well as bringing you the best comment and analysis from the web i will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the you want to follow me or contact me on on try to monitor the comments but normally i find it impossible to read them all if you have a direct do include in it somewhere and more likely to find it i do try to answer direct although sometimes i miss them or have time alternatively you could post a question to me on twitter
sometimes i think i have never seen anything as strong as that mean that i like and admire everything about her not here to argue about who she just to note what she did i watched her plow through opposition and attacks the like of which no other candidate has ever faced and still win the popular vote to defeat her it took an unholy cabal far beyond what faced when he was the campaign of swimming with the tide of disgust about the bush administration as the new times the time all the ballots are she seems likely to be ahead by more than votes and more than 1 5 percentage points she will have won by a wider percentage margin than not only gore in 2000 but also in 1968 and john f in twitter concession know can flip that and see that trump was such a weak candidate it took decades of scheming and an extraordinary international roster of powerful players to lay the groundwork that made his election possible defeating in the electoral college took the 2013 gutting of the voting rights act by republican appointees to the supreme court it took vast republican voter suppression laws and tactics set in place over many years it took voter intimidation at many polling places it took the long republican campaign to blow up the boring bureaucratic irregularity of use of a private email server into a scandal that the media obediently picked up and reheated us yet to join ranks of countries with female leaders read took the director of the using that and his power to stage a misleading smear attack on 11 days before the election in flagrant violation of the custom of avoiding such intervention for 60 days before an election it took a compliant mainstream media running after his sabotage like a golden retriever chasing a tennis ball it took decades of conservative attacks on the served as deputy counsel to the senate whitewater that fishing expedition that began with an investigation in a messy real estate deal in before bill presidency and ended with a campaign to impeach him on charges related to completely unrelated sexual activities during his second took a nearly reality the that deified racism and narcissism as essential to success and power as the feminist media critic points trump said and did was framed in a way to flatter and more flatter his the colossal infomercial fictionalized the cheating businessman as an unqualified success and gave him a kind of brand recognition no other candidate had it took the full support of fox whose roger was so committed to him that after leaving the company following allegations of decades of sexual harassment of he joined the trump campaign it took the withdrawal of too many from even that of journalism into the partisan unreliability of sites and bubbles of social took the mainstream of failure to address climate change as the most important issue of our time it took decades of most media outlets letting the propaganda arm create the false framework of two equally valid opinions rather than reporting the overwhelming scientific consensus and tremendous danger of climate change to stop it also took using as a tool of evidently considering his grudge against the democratic nominee important enough to try to aid the campaign of a racist authoritarian now appears to have so close a relationship with that he often appears on the channel and news site rt he tweeted protests when president information was included in the panama papers hack and has been coy about where his leaked information on the democratic national committee came intelligence experts say it came from and made it clear that he favored win the day dropped his the new times ran a story reassuringly titled investigating sees no clear link to with its own underplayed revelation buried the officials have become increasingly based on the evidence they have that direct goal is not to support the election of as many democrats have but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine standing in the world more beef over loss is with liberal young and old read it took a shortsighted campaign of hatred on the an almost hysterical rage like nothing i have ever seen before about any public figure some uncritically picked up outright and spin to feed their hate and rejected anything that diluted the purity and focus of that including larger questions about the other candidate and the fate of the earth it was so extreme that in recent i was attacked for posting news stories on social media by furious people who took the position that to be overtly was to be covertly if the perfect is the enemy of the whose friend is the greater of two a lot of people seemed to think the primary ended the night trump was elected i saw that from climate and others who you might expect would have turned to face the clear and present danger of a trump presidency i for much about failure to address the pipeline adequately which was and but overshadowed by what we heard so little million dollars or so invested in the pipeline and the guarantee he would use presidential powers to push it and every pipeline like it through impossible to disconnect the irrational emotionality from and the misogyny continues since election been hearing too many men of the left go on and on about how was a weak candidate wondered about that word not only because it is so often associated with but because what calling her weakness was their refusal to support her as if sent a pink lifeboat and we sent it because we wanted a blue and now we are very upset that people are as my brilliant friend put it some point soon we need to discuss whether sanders would have been able to but helpful it just sounds like democrats should have cut into lead in the misogynist vote and the vote by running a white come to terms with the racism and the misogyny before analyzing the because otherwise just going to replicate it forever and if you think that the angry vote won sanders would have fared let me remind you that patriarchy and white supremacy are the cornerstones of the i know that if had been elected there would not be terrified and weeping people of color all over the small children too afraid to go to a shocking spike in hate students with smashed dreams marching in cities across the country i deplore some of past actions and alignments and disagreed with plenty of her 2016 positions i hoped to be fighting her for the next four years but i recognize the profound differences between her and trump on immigration and and her extraordinary tenacity and courage in facing and nearly overcoming an astonishing array of obstacles to win the popular vote which reminds us that trump has no mandate and sets before us some of the forces arrayed against us elections on on via

trump has done pretty well for someone ridiculed by most of the liberal media as an incoherent babbler his campaigning speeches were just people chuckled but the speeches worked and they did so because trump is a brilliant and careful rhetorician his slogan of renewed domestic glory great won over what was which met exactly the same fate as the remain insipid the language of political discourse greatness and strength are both examples of a a guiding metaphor or image for a political argument it is striking how often trump deployed the frames of happiness and going to be so going to be so he would even as he curried with racists frames can inspire but they can also another we hear a lot about these days the three judges who ruled on the article 50 challenge were called of the by the daily while the telegraph spoke of judges against the even though the decision defended right to parliamentary representation against the arbitrary exercise of executive power this singular has come into peculiar focus since the vote as may said again this the majority of the voted to leave the the now the supposed of the must be respected except and are purely imaginary twitter slogan

language or argumentative idea that should back control of our for dishonestly implied that we had no control over them but the same frame can be invoked by many different forms of words also part of the leave for was the emphasis on making our own laws and reclaiming our sovereignty else we already as evidenced by the very fact we are able to leave the arguments are often conducted as a clash of frames control or security or and successful social and political reforms can be accompanied by clever in the or was the frame was not one of but one of of simple fairness and in this or so it might

shall meet twitter the leave campaign the need to reclaim our sovereignty are all around us they saturate political and social discourse some think this is just the way mass political communication is bound to but others say it have to must we always fight framing with or is it time to try something recent it has become fashionable in political psychology to say broadly liberals and conservatives respond positively to different sorts of frame this is one of the ideas promoted by the cognitive linguist whose popular book on think of an became a battle manual for despondent democrats after w second election victory in an earlier moral suggested that a major difference between conservatives and liberals lies in their mental models of the family republicans love a while democrats prefer a this pointed out trump is not some bizarre perversion of republican party on the he played the campaign as the ultimate threatening to ban and from entering the and ready to insult anyone who disagreed with him a pragmatic par as well as a master of political model of liberal v conservative frames has been developed by the psychologist his scheme lists six axes along which people make political value and research suggests that liberals respond more strongly than other people to arguments within the and and less strongly to the others respond more or less equally to all six this is offered as one explanation as to why the frames of strength and group for are traditionally while the left invoke empathy and people that this difference makes a campaigning job fundamentally easier than a as lecturer in political psychology at the university of explains shows that people endorse ideologies because they offer feelings of certainty and she says has been argued that hold a sort of psychological because they provide simpler and possibly less ambiguous ideas on how society should work such ideas would be especially appealing to those who have been feeling powerless or out of and the recent economic crisis or increasing terrorist threats might have made people especially prone to feel this in the issue of abortion rights in the one side uses the frame of life the other the frame of choice and trump campaigns did employ what are often thought of as frames but not only those a professor of political communication at tech and the author of several books on frame observes that both campaigns employed great deal of safety as well as loyalty of the not the not the trump also exploited the frames that supposedly appeal most to liberals think part of that he is also speaking out using the and in other those theoretically owned by his opponents trump claimed empathy for downtrodden while the aggressive moniker however unfair in evidently idea that the right are better at framing than the left has been common since the early but there are differing ideas about why it should be so some people think frames are more attractive to many people because they are simple and easy to understand like think the problem is that democrats have not taken framing seriously enough to do it right others add that institutions are key a philosopher at the university of east and a green party runs the green house and the words whose aim is to explore ways of communicating ecological issues more powerfully to the public more resourcing is he for the left to match the framing power of its adversaries one of the we need the kind of network of foundations etc that the right has money twitter the daily mail called the judges who ruled on the article 50 challenge over were called of the daily what is to be like many thinks those on the left ought to be bolder about for tend too often to act like a bunch of policy rather than a bunch of people out to he says in his 2014 common he suggests that the very idea of suggests that nature is something outside and that implies simply adjusting the current system so that it can keep going for ever instead of he suggests that greens should adopt a frame of opposition to economic growth to its own sake should be framed not as to or but as advises democrats to pivot to the frames of and stop defending he and instead talk about and so forth take back he advises resources provide for freedom in private enterprise and private he even suggests that progressives should up identity politics no more black issues their

of framing can defeat the bad in his recent book enough mark the former of the argues that framing and spin have rendered the political environment toxic he calls on politicians to a mode of treating the public like and speaking honestly about the difficult involved in any decision if aggressive framing by the right is somehow misleading and why should it be acceptable for the there is no perfectly neutral language that is completely free of but clashes of highly potent frames can easily just lead to entrenched positions in a kind of frozen rhetorical as with the versus standoff in the us twitter mark former of the has said that framing and spin have rendered the political environment toxic what if the overarching frame that governs our political disagreements is itself too much of politics right is conducted within a in other person or side is needs to be punished i believe this is an easier for liberals to engage in given that their moral foundations are so strongly linked with and although conservatives are not immune to this by any means but how easy is it to someone when you view them as unfair and harmful to the equitable view of humanity to which you this is already happening with trump and trump supporters things would be more if we switched to a comic which the conservative philosopher defined as one in which people are mistaken all people are exposed to situations in which they must act as there is a deeper problem with over the notion that the right are so much better at framing than they are it is that it implies an uncomfortable theory of false consciousness among the benighted ordinary folk who vote for causes and politicians they must be blinded by the they could not possibly be deciding on the basis of the actual people and policies could maybe they are it could very well be that the success of the way the and trump campaigns were framed was just a symptom of something rather than the proximate cause of victory the appeal of certain frames depends mainly on the real prevailing social conditions at any given suggests professor of linguistics at the university of oxford lot have been complaining about loss of sovereignty since we but it took a prolonged period of deepening inequality and social upheaval to give traction or in other maybe not primarily a question of how things are represented trump create his angry white they created a space for him to documentary agrees that the framing is secondary think that the attraction of trump or has much to do with the they he says not sure people believe those either what they both do offer people is a giant button with written on it in giant letters and faced with a distrust of all the old a lot of people want to press that twitter trump addressing supporters during a campaign rally in argues that the power of political framing may be on the because the rise of especially in the world of social is an existential challenge to mass democracy itself shape the world they way they politicians have to assemble the masses together what gives them need to convince to return to our earlier that we are or the way they do by persuading people to give themselves up to a compelling story in an age of impossible it becomes like herding because everyone wants to define their own story and definitely not give themselves up to the where will the next big the frames of the come is obviously a real hunger for something that allows you to challenge a system in which many people feel more and more says think trump or are that but they are straws in the he that a simple return to nationalism is the next epochal frame he it will come from religion or science but whatever it he points it have to square the circle it will make you still feel that you are an individual in control of your life and feelings but also make you want to surrender yourself to some grand picture of the future someone who manages to put those two together is going to be very might fear that

words matter the process of understanding why trump is now heading for the white house starts with the correct description of what has happened in the eight years since became economists call the turbulent period that followed the collapse of brothers the great recession others say the us along with other developed nations is experiencing secular stagnation it to avoid using the d dictionary definition of a depression is a downturn in economic which sums up precisely what has occurred since 2008 growth rates globally have remained low despite colossal amounts of stimulus living standards have barely risen and the threat of deflation has loomed large the depression since 2008 has not been as severe as that of the but there are echoes of it all the in the food banks that are the new soup in the mass movements of migrants in search of a better life who are the modern equivalent of the in the grapes of and in who has tapped into anger that has been bubbling away quietly for turning point for the average worker came in the because for the first 30 years after the second world war the gains from rising prosperity were evenly shared but this trend was broken around the time of and the end of the war since productivity in the us has more than but average hourly compensation has increased by only the fruits of growth have been captured by the not the tendency was especially pronounced in the years immediately after when lower interest rates and quantitative easing fed through into rising asset prices rather than into higher wages between more than of us growth went to the richest which included the financiers who had caused the crisis in the first is not just that workers have been struggling to get a decent pay rise jobs have become harder to find in the last with many dropping out of the market altogether the participation rate among males to fell at the time of the crash and has never in the the outlook for working people in the us has improved over the past couple of years because the collapse of energy prices has led to lower inflation and higher real incomes but it has not been enough to counter the feeling that the system is director of the resolution provided a useful breakdown of voting patterns in last presidential election taken at face the results seem to show that did well among those voters on the lowest incomes she led among those earning less than a year and by among those earning between and these statistics are misleading there was actually a net swing to the republicans between the 2012 and 2016 elections among those earning less than a year and a swing among those earning to by there was a swing to the democrats among those on higher and this was particularly pronounced among those earning more than a reasons for trump were also the reasons for john read interpretation of these numbers would be that on average or below average incomes voted for in 2008 and 2012 because they expected fundamental change from which they would benefit they were still waiting for the change to come in 2016 and thought trump was more likely to provide it than the better who have being doing just fine out of business as supported as the candidate of the status quo for wall street and silicon valley she was the safer choice as in other western the party ostensibly of the left had nothing to say that its traditional base wanted to have been three stages to this process of political estrangement when the postwar era parties of the left focused exclusively on economic issues the emphasis was on curing the ills of the poverty and slum housing governments were committed to full employment and redistribution and were prepared to use controls on goods and people to deliver those goals there was little appetite for fighting cultural wars neither harry in the us nor clement in could be described as a social second phase came in the when the parties of the left backed both economic and social reform in the it was the era of civil rights legislation and great society to tackle poverty in the government had its national plan for the economy but also gave a fair wind to changes never the abolition of capital the of legal easier divorce and the relaxation of censorship third and final phase of this process began in the parties of the left gradually accepted defeat in the economic war and devoted their energies to winning the cultural war instead it was taken as a given that the focus of policy should be control of inflation rather than full employment it was accepted that there should be as few impediments to free markets as with government intervention limited to tackling any problems that might arise curbs on trade unions introduced by parties of the right were not rolled back was seen as an unstoppable force that ruled out the interventionist policies of the past the democrats in the us and in the limited themselves to topping up poverty wages and argued that the answer to jobs being shipped overseas was for the newly unemployed to get better a parties of the left had nothing to say when the financial crisis of 2008 exposed the weaknesses of growth and economics they could point to some notable victories in the culture wars reforms that have made the us and the much more tolerant countries than they were three or four decades ago but under depression conditions that has not been enough the failure to articulate an alternative economic strategy has led to the erosion of political support in their old where disenchanted voters feel ignored and that means is that the political divide is now not really between left and right but between liberals who believe in free trade and free movement of people and populists who believe in the nation state and controls on the movement of people and

of some people are wondering whether the states will truly ever be united many in the us and around the world fear the taking to bed and streaming while drinking wine a particularly effective way forward for the country for guidance on how to move past and we asked those best equipped at knowing how to laugh in the face of pain and comedians having a twitter while i am not sold on the term i am still going to use it i am going to my sense of social responsibility and remember that everyone has their own unique and to have compassion before vitriol i am not but if i may their term for merely this i may decide this is the time for my global time to finally see or live in a have to move forward no matter what because that is the nature of political cycles i think in our best interest to process all our emotions as they come and then remember that positive change just happen every four it happens all the time and this a just a roadblock and evolution are as vital a part of democracy as compromise and precedent for i will be replaying clips from the simply to exist in a bubbling hot tub of denial once i move past probably download seven more guided meditation and commit to more flax in my diet inevitably going to be bumpy so might as well keep both ends of my body on have to get back out twitter i have little wisdom to share today it feels dark scared what i do know is that i have a voice and a platform and so many others whose lives will be affected by this election do not though today is a i have to get back out there i chose my job because i wanted to make the world a safer place and starting tomorrow allowing myself a i will get back to work when you are join fall for the same old twitter the only answer i have is for me to get back to work i tell anyone else how to deal with it not black or gay or a woman and i know the fear in their hearts after something like this i can read all the articles about how poor whites who voted him in because in ravaged rural communities and they see any change in the last eight years so they were going to vote republican no matter about holding the media and news companies accountable for reporting on how about fuck the democrats in the first place for every swaying the nomination away from my answer for getting over all maybe fall for the same old shit news outlets can go to can we laugh we because we always will i laughed at jokes about on be fine comedy is indestructible you destroy it just like a war on terror you destroy a concept or a feeling send this to them look how righteous i am i have to go tell jokes in times fucking square tonight back to for those who have a twitter i think being about the situation is the first step totally understandable to feel dread right but more important to not let that dread incapacitate you occupy your mind with being vigilant of the oppression around you it has become so easy to justify oppression in our and we need to be ready to stand for those who have much of a voice right now there are a lot of citizens nervous and scared right now i feel like helping in whatever way you can to and strengthen will also help yourself to cope trying to find ways that make it easier for us all to listen to each other is a fantastic endeavor right way to move forward that i am personally trying is to inject more logical thinking into my comedy material it seems as a country right we are leaning more on emotional response and less on logic to make our decisions comedy is great because it can help condition people to think more critically about things without it coming off as forced comedy can disarm and open people up to new ways of thinking rock and his for seem like there are any easy answers to fixing all this right but weed is more legal now so roll a grab your and look to the must be twitter comedians are surviving this election the way everyone else only a little bit easier get me this quite the most disastrous thing that has happened to me in my entire life my anxiety is so bad physically incapable of being depressed i got up and took a hike this morning who am it because i wanted to feel good it was because i literally wanted to stomp on something as hard as i could and i decided the thing i was going to stomp on was planet earth i would die to change this outcome if i could truly i have no unfinished business on this planet been on had some great i did i saw the that being of all the feelings had today despair one thing not feeling is block not a silver just a fact i take for granted that in this i am luckier than the other people living through this nightmare i get to make jokes and pound my fist and get and because a comedian and because a person who was born in this not much of a chance this presidency will affect me even with even a fraction of the force with which going to devastate everyone else i have no advice i know we need to fight this and i know we need to hang on to whatever feelings we have now that feel like like momentum because if going to stop this piece of garbage from treating our country the way he treats everyone else who has ever crossed his going to need to be vigilant for a long need kindness and twitter my job is to allow people to feel like moving forward by being able to laugh about difficulty or take a break from the real world by laughing for a while until i can think of something else more worthwhile i will keep doing this i was lucky enough to perform in prison for an mostly men of color audience this year it was one of the best shows i have done because something special was going on in that room that just about audience and a comedian it was about understanding people different from you and knowing that fear might creep up but staying open is essential these men are living in actual prison and many of them have already paid their debt to society but cannot be paroled for whatever reason and they find ways to move forward behind bars with no freedoms i felt it in the kindness that they showed me and how one of the prisoners offered to pray for my who was going to have surgery at the time i am of a different faith than that prisoner but during that moment i accepted whatever prayers from whatever religion because what was behind that was kindness and moving forward this kindness and empathy is going to feel very hard but this is part of getting things done in a country which feels like not your own active or twitter any survival tips for facing down a trump like to quote trump for this they go we go or if you live in a state legalized they go we get for i think this is all a big shocking sign that we need to do more for each show understanding for one join forces with allies and help curate the world we want to live in as for how to move we need to get active some friends and i put together a called nasty women we raised for the downtown la center and it felt amazing going to keep doing them becoming active in the parts of the world you see as needing empowerment is a beam of light at the end of what feels like a dark just got material for the next four twitter trump is a big orange bug zapper of and he just gave me material for the next four years he do anything that you want to make fun of a a a cartoon take it so seriously you do anything about it invest in spray tan and learn more this question of do we move was posed after that was a serious situation it was catastrophic people died that was a real moment this sucks buffoonery but we go forward we laugh at it and we hope he fuck things up too time to listen to women and people of twitter advice on moving say for straight white male comedians time to stop giving advice and start listening to women and people and people of color instead of jumping to figure out my going to listen and read and watch and try to be ready next time so ashamed this caught me will keep me twitter i survived election night because i was on a show in with four wonderful female comedians and we got to vent on stage and afterwards comfort each other we got to convey every emotion we were experiencing in the moment which is what i hope everyone is doing you have to get your feelings process them and move to action you have to turn those feelings into quantifiable steps to support organizations that will help further your vision of what should be this has been a very nasty election i felt like i needed a shower i had a sleepless night on but this morning i got hugged my talked to my mom and told her i loved her and then i realized love is what will keep me going i need love to fight resident the tonight has never been more twitter how do we move comedy has never been more important i have a feeling there will be some new policies suppressing critical voices in the next year or and if not a direct policy at least a threat of violence is already so comedians are going to play an important in prodding and exposing the trunk of hypocrisy and rights violations that will be in the few years sure will make it easy in most but in some of the more important issues we will have to look deeper into really going on so our jobs just became a bit more not only to brighten the spirits of those who need and to make sense of going but also to make sure voices of dissension and criticism are heard if the press gets curtailed in how they can report on or if we allowed to protest any comedy will be our only resort it seems to be the main outlet where a lot of the country gets their news from anyway if you look at under a republican the economy tanks and the arts up on history and take twitter going to spend the next couple months taking and writing a ton of jokes we back down so you better bet going to be loud and queer as fuck the next four years find and stick together with your community and people of read up on history because the revolution or the second world war is coming and i will definitely keep making fun of trump because only thinking of him as a giant orange will make you feel better that such an unqualified man is our president we have to listen to one another and love each other but also stand up for yourself and know that progress takes time and we need to keep fighting to get there as a just please before the apocalypse on on via on on on on on this content
2 another big week for me and my cancer they but so and things are really hotting up before the us election got a good show managed to persuade piers as one of the few journalists who actually knows trump to speak to us from his car while filming in for and really interesting about what the media have understood about the piers is also one of the people from the worlds of journalism and broadcasting many of whom if honest i really claim to know especially well come forward to make my life easier they know this or by offering good wishes and positive thoughts and if my experience is anything to go if you know anyone with a cancer diagnosis hesitate just drop them a line to let them know thinking of them genuinely appreciated show went i but still suffering from occasionally quite acute fatigue i blame the as i get anything like this in the course of seven cycles of also since the really only able to sleep on my back my kingdom for a pair of can i hear despairing partners the doctors reckon this might be because of the impact of the radiotherapy on my which been by the well with the malarkey except that at around five on morning i get the first signs of an unmistakable and potentially very painful condition kidney i was first diagnosed with them more than 25 years ago and every now and again since a new one would get stuck in my kidney and kick off a bout of the name given to the excruciating pain that can come with them this time a couple of painkillers see it off but stand if you can face for what happened a few days 3 first day on the new treatment and one having to pay and my first visit to what one of the nurses laughingly described as otherwise known as the patients medical day so at there i am being shown into the discreetly hidden from the regular day unit be visiting later for my infusion and guess it looked very similar to its and while on the subject of business the seats were actually staff were of and i got my first dose of the very expensive plus per which the currently treatment was first class as previously no problem with the principle that i should pay for as the should be protected from additional unfunded treatment costs i choose to avail myself of but i still struggle with the royal taking a markup simply to supply an already very expensive drug by the is already standard treatment as part of chemotherapy for my cancer in the us and charging a private day rate as a whole day for a treatment that takes just over an hour taken to calling it my very own for scandal i hope putting the money to good which is perhaps something worth looking having received my i was escorted back downstairs to rejoin the rest of the human race in the and do you aside from having identical seats to i think there might actually be more space down but time to get reacquainted with the as its name is a rubber cap attached to a refrigeration system that rapidly cools the thus reducing the risk of hair loss that some chemotherapy drugs otherwise more or less guarantee it work for but it really worked for me over seven cycles of to be a few quizzical looks from other patients more used to seeing women using it and the endurance test that is the first 20 minutes of wearing it as it literally freezes your scalp brain freeze and multiply by was a very small price to pay of course forgotten how hard it would be and very nearly took it off but in the end the name of the new machines they now have at the and a from the staff got me though it so i still have hair on my 5 would turn out to be one of the most difficult since i was diagnosed back in march and none of it to do with my cancer or its metastases directly for a i have been suffering with constipation of cancer patients once it gets to 5 or 6 days as it has for me can become almost painfully uncomfortable then there was the discomfort under my right ribs put down to my liver playing up more another hangover from the radiotherapy and to cap it all was the recurring renal colic from my kidney stones and their appalling sense of timing and the twist the painkillers a mixture of paracetamol and codeine tend to work less effectively over time make you more cut a long story was a bit of a perfect in increasing discomfort and waiting until enough time had elapsed to allow me to take more painkillers which no longer quite do the and make the worse as a i leave the house and have no desire to eat or drink and the latter set to provide the biggest twist of all 8 at for blood tests preparatory to the next dose of new due by after such a dreadful i can add extreme fatigue to my list of ailments dress and have to sit slightly for a rest blood tests show sharply declining level of which means no for me unless they recover doctor also spots that my blood pressure is pretty low and i get when standing up and so prescribes intravenous fluids to 9 at looking forward to radio 4 today same thing happens extreme fatigue and dizzy when i stand up decide might not be possible the by the have been nothing but support itself over the course of my cancer travails return to hospital for more iv fluids i think these are probably the consequences of the radiotherapy taking my appetite for and drink and my simply not drinking enough for far too 10 to to see whether platelet levels have improved sufficiently for treatment to proceed not only have they gone down further something my consultant starling and her team are unsure of the cause of but my blood up and down like a a i was admitted as an to the to try to get these things sorted out and see what might be done with my kidney which are still giving me three days as i write intravenous fluids and antibiotics and a host of new medications later where i still the ward staff are great and

in when the gender identity development service at clinic it received two referrals in its first year of operation as current director of the it was considered a option for a clinical psychologist to in the field of gender identity in young people there enough patients that is not how it has turned out last 1 , 400 children under 18 were referred to double the number the year before of these nearly 300 were under the age of with some as young as three years reasons for this exponential increase are obviously complex one factor seems to be a huge shift in awareness of individuals in wider culture the attention paid to in and a carter playing a role in the historic tragedy of the story told in and the many public controversies about respect for trans rights have all informed this awareness it is never just a phase if these kids do go through self has helped to open up a space for greater acceptance and particularly in but also for highly emotive and debate about how best to help young people who believe they need to transition at the sharpest end of this debate are the parents whose children are identifying themselves as well before and sometimes living outwardly as the other sex these children and their parents are more aware than ever that there are choices available to them to correct what they believe to be the error in their bodies it can seem these choices are the ultimate but the decisions parents have to make about intervening in their biology are anything but couple of weeks ago i sat in on a conference by a charitable support group for parents of children who identify as trans the charity has been much in the news in recent in part because it has featured in the widely reported custody battle heard at the high court that involved a boy of seven allowed to live as a because his mother had become convinced those were his wishes the judge in the justice ruled that the boy should live with his and that the mother caused significant emotional harm to her son in her active determination that he should be a mermaids had supported the mother in her belief that her son identified as for two years and described the ruling as a injustice and which had been for the another case it was reported that a family was taking legal action against a local authority for backing their adoption of a name as a step towards changing her gender the mother of the girl said she believed her daughter was too young to make her own decision rights of parents in the are being she those who have traditional values it is leaving parents to feel vulnerable and twitter aged started asking his mum questions about gender at the age of six at s management digital art bell s went along to the mermaids conference in part to try to make sense of some of these issues for myself it seems to me unquestionably a wonderful thing that young people faced with some of the trauma of these feelings about who they are can find tolerant space in which to experiment with different expressions of their gender and be protected in law from discrimination but as a i find it hard to get rid of the feeling that the more choices you give to younger the more they are likely to adopt them for a variety of psychological reasons is a or an or a or a really able to make informed enough decisions about the consequences of a complete shift in their gender involving deed poll name change and living are we formed in our gender identities before puberty or by and can the psychological consequences of these decisions possibly be mermaids conference was addressed by a endocrinologist at the hospital in and the guiding light of the charity is an evangelist for what some parents of children see as a revolution in the medical treatment of their kids he sees gender through the lens of his own specialism hormones and has devoted his working life to having other people view this question in the same way he dislikes the term reassign a he just acknowledge what it really is and fix at one point in his led his audience in an impromptu rendition of times they are in of bob prize but also to highlight the generational shift in attitudes toward gender identity that we are congressmen please heed the a battle outside these kids are desperate they have a bath or shower and that of most of his the times are not changing nearly fast enough for some children is a advocate for early medical intervention in gender identity cases he proposes following the model inspired by clinics in the in which children identifying as are routinely given drugs after the onset of and then move on to high doses of hormones to change their and then later perhaps consider surgery the most controversial part of this protocol is the age at which children are given the the effects of which can be irreversible and may lead to a loss of fertility the guidelines currently state that no children be given this hormone treatment until they are around 16 sees the age as and often cruel he an arena of enormous this kind of certainty is seductive looking around the room at the attended by many parents faced with these you can sense heartfelt relief among some that there is an to their anxieties as someone not faced with these that relief seems open to the supplementary question of how a parent or child can honestly be certain this is what they want before the child has reached has no doubts genuine gender is easily he believes it is never just a or a box kids miss an opportunity to is who i he argues have a fantasy that they are going to get the puberty they not the one they are programmed for tomboys have boys who seem a bit feminine have that if these kids do go through self he up to die prematurely of including addiction and suicide he put 200 on to hormone blockers at the onset of puberty of have gone on to take hormones because one changes their at which i no twitter reassign a we just acknowledge what it is and fix patients is a young whose is the of mermaids had a desperate time in her teens attempting to kill herself seven times as her male hormones threatened to give her an identity she and her parents looked anywhere for help frustrated by what they saw as the slow process of the which has a perceived on referrals in england and green contacted and took her daughter to his clinic in so outwardly successful was his treatment that was subsequently a finalist in the miss england beauty mermaids parents addressed the room with unhappier stories several particularly for its rigid rule against giving children the hormone before and for the waiting times for a consultation at the some parents had gone down the route of for their buying blockers and hormones from or over the for fear they would miss the when transition was possible some turned to a in who has a controversial private practice to address this sudden need once you then you only look for medical made headlines in the summer for sex hormones to a she came to the stage at the mermaids conference tearful along with most of the room about some of the stories she had just heard particular that of a trans girl who had been through only to be made the when she i spoke to after her which had ended with her embracing her clinic has been running for nearly two years it started with a just to see what the response would be she was immediately overwhelmed with emails and letters people are so she they spend a lot of time on the i think that is how it snowballed at long last there was a doctor willing to has had 500 young 50 of whom have on to she has 3 , 500 adult patients most of her consultation is through and though she has a meeting with children and their parents before prescribing drugs she shares sense of urgent is but that mean it is is dismayed by the fact that her work has been subject of criticism from senior psychiatrists at the flagship hospital for provision at charing cross she is due to meet though the service she offers is not through the who go on to treatment pay a flat fee and then per month for her consultative want to try to stop me from what i am doing because it is embarrassing for she says do put my career on the line to do this but these kids are desperate they have a bath or a shower naked they will change their pants in the dark they want a puberty blocker so they grow or so their voices break and then you have to wait your 18 weeks to get to the or twitter and know the outcomes of these i am talking to it is hard not to get caught up in her passion for her her conviction that she is doing her best by the families who come to her when i come doubts resurface can these kinds of psychological diagnoses really be so clear that you can base them on i subsequently speak to and members of her multidisciplinary team at the it is clear they do not share the conviction that diagnosis for children can be so straightforward says that because the treatment pathway identified by is relatively honestly know in you know the outcomes of these the only proper longitudinal study has been from the dutch clinics which pioneered this but even that is based on a mixed cohort of children at different stages of puberty who were given the blocker the is soon to begin publishing its own research into a more group of children who have been given hormone blockers starting in 2011 have to move forward on the evidence base while respecting that individuals will have very strong beliefs in what is right and approach itself is too radical for some after a long period of assessment and it moves a proportion of its young patients on to blockers and some on to hormones at 16 to ever think of gender only as something to be by hormone treatment is really of the complexities of identity and once you have done you look only for medical the offers a team that includes endocrinologists as well as family psychiatrists and others twitter onward poppy went back to school this using her new name s the spike in the clinic is finding different patterns in the young people they see while the younger children often presenting in a binary thinking that their only solution is a change of hormones and a change of sex very young come armed with ideas not only about what surgery they need but which surgeons they would like to perform older teenagers are often thinking a more diverse about their identity and the fluidity of their and can be supported to explore expressions of who they are that for some may not involve medical are trying to treat whole young she says example we have had a couple of young people who after a lot of decided to reject a binary approach because they want to preserve their fertility this is not to say that their identification has just that they have chosen to retaining fertility over achieving a more consistently male or female physical is caught between entrenched voices on the one believe hormone treatment of children misguided in any case on the see it as the only way forward she courageously it seems to to defend the complexities of the middle ground start to think if you have these feelings at a certain age then this is the only path to she say that the case every young person who comes to us has different fact is reinforced by the two mothers through the mermaids have spoken to this feature and whose stories appear on these pages some readers will find the acceptance of their determination to choose their gender identity as a cause for others will retain doubts that these questions can be resolved with the kind of clarity that and express in relation to their such complexities will be further no in the reaction to a channel 4 documentary that will air later this the first time a broadcaster has been allowed access to the work of the one of three on the examines the lives of two children attending the clinic for assessment it is impossible not to with the unbelievably hard choices faced on all sides but to believe that with the right there are now ways forward for these children that even a generation ago would have been hard to transitioned from female to male in is mum to 9 twitter i that josh might not just be a tomboy when he was six and his teacher said he quite know his place in the world i believe in being honest with my children so when josh started asking me last year if there were operations where women could cut off their boobs i said but told him it was very painful and difficult i was hoping to put him off the but he carried on asking the referred us to the clinic glad in the system now as when josh starts puberty hopefully there will be hormone blockers available if he wants to use them you discipline this out of a child not them being was at the end of last during the that josh asked me if he could start using another name instead of his the first few months after his transition i told josh repeatedly he could go back to being any time he but never shown the desire to change his first his became quite challenging he could be awkward and but i think he was just testing the boundaries of his new identity when he all the normal rules still he settled down i think now that more confident since his transition at first he was very worried he would never be a proper but i tried to keep reassuring him that much more about how you present yourself than in your has been very supportive the other children simply accept that a boy the practicalities have been harder i still and then have to correct myself to and getting used to male pronouns has been too i do worry about the future and that the road going down is only going to get but wanting to change gender something you can discipline out of a child not them being naughty or something deep inside transitioned from male to female in 2015 is mum to 9 twitter when poppy was five she saved up her pocket money to buy a which she loved we enrolled her into a drama club as it was a safe place for her to be able to dress up how she wanted and express but as she grew older it became increasingly difficult to treat her as a when she was clearly a grew her hair longer and adopted a feminine voice i know whether i should be correcting the checkout assistant who told daughter is so my older came out as gay when she was and i the same signs in the stress of not being able to live as who you really are she would drop coins into the well at the bottom of our garden and wish to become a and by the time she was seven she started telling me she was in the wrong body she would drop coins into the well in the garden and wish to be a was no question of me not letting her do this it was simply what had to happen as a parent i can put my foot down and you wear your sandals in the but i put my foot down and not allow my child to be herself i did lots of research and the and suicide rates for young people who are trans and unsupported at home are frighteningly so all we could do was be led by her and support her in becoming a happy and confident went back to school this year as a using her new name the change was remarkable her confidence blossomed and her school work has improved the school asked speakers from supporting young trans people to come in and talk to staff and pupils about what was happening it has taken her dad time to get his head around it he was brought up as a in but he gave me a daughter and i love my main fear now is that if we get medical support start puberty as a boy i think that would be intolerable for wrote a story recently where she compared her transition to a

trump has promised to build a wall along the border between the us and after his electoral triumph over many are wondering whether actually pull this or any of his other controversial along with many other minorities in the were railed against by trump during his campaign in the to the he vowed to rid the us of yet despite this adding to his record of xenophobic trump was elected the 45th president of the united states mapping the trump 10 countries and regions feeling the heat read real estate billionaire promised to scrap the north free trade agreement on grounds that it at the expense of us workers he has also threatened to tax the money sent home from the us by migrants to in for the aforementioned spoke to in the us and about the election of and how they think his presidency might affect their lives what they underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on feel dismayed and deeply disappointed as bad as that the worst part is feeling powerless we have a say in an event that can have catastrophic consequences to our economy in the us we are seen as collateral damage even those opposing trump seem indifferent to the economic and human pain this situation can inflict on us i understand the economic pain that people in the rust belt are feeling successful trade agreements transfer some jobs from one country to another but are net job creators to all involved countries under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt north gained and the south has but this is the result of failed compensating measures within both countries boosted wealth across the subcontinent cutting ties with will also harm the us it surprises me that during the campaign no one pointed this out and perceive that trade is a game under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt it surprises me this was n't pointed as trump adopts a pragmatic the damage can be limited to a further decline in my purchasing power owing to the peso devaluation and a difficult business environment while expectations are better anchored if he feels obligated to deliver on the promises made to his voters and revokes things could be much worse our government has little leverage because underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on them they are self absorbed and busy inflicting pain on one another of will probably send us into an even deeper power trump has over over our over our our perception of our freedom of over the way the world will see us is terrifying and he is not even the president we woke up to find the exchange rate at 20 50 pesos for the dollar we went from 18 70 per dollar on election to 20 20 yesterday and 20 50 today expected to reach 30 by the end of the year we have been humiliated in front of the deportations of many who live and work in the united who send money home and who contribute tremendously in that way to our economy will probably send us into an even deeper recession his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever see we 're surprised how many love adore are more than willing to welcome in any who wishes to make their home for the next four bring your come live bring your help us out we are a welcoming country with amazing fantastic great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and we hope they will seriously consider it that goes for people who want to escape the our collective the democracy was something to aspire to the spell has been broken in many ways in even the least educated among us believe this man to be a buffoon his ideas are uninspired and poorly that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen we are surprised by how much and how many love adore are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology will now inspire this we ask has created a dangerous stereotype of in the have a visa and i can travel throughout the us whenever i which is a lot but i am concerned of the increase of hate or that as a result of the stereotype i live in a place visited by a lot of tourists i worry that they will think that i am or that they think i am a drug dealer or a is not fair that a presidential candidate has blamed because of issues they have he has created a dangerous stereotype of in the us there are a lot of undocumented but a lot of us are living legally in the us many drugs go the us through the but what they forget is the us is the first drug consumer worldwide what they say is that they are in part responsible for the drug cartel violence in some we make jokes about it we now say that we are no longer the country with the stupidest president in the world silver lining is that perceives trump as a common politics in can find common ground to make front to his politics and maybe force the common efforts by different parties before the 2018 presidential election i really hope margarita will engage in alliances with other parties to win the will suffer irremediably if trump imposes tariffs on imports renegotiating for example or tax the remittances the fiscal situation in is already strained owing to low oil prices and corrupt politicians with vast regions of the country in hands of or crime trump adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt politicians like president and the foreign trumps adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt are going to inflation and currency devaluation will spike making expenses more difficult recession is already showing its claws and jobs cuts are on the rise in major banks as we silver lining is that perceives trump as a common enemy ended up being popular in the wrong first it was a feeling of then it was a surprise we did not stop laughing with all the irony in those fear campaigns of the media work very surprising that they work at all in the us all that money spent to promote and his hate campaign would have been used for something useful ended up being popular in the wrong things could change in if trump complies with the construction of his good things could happen in the reactivation of the local economy destroyed by the reactivation of small businesses currently by big foreign corporations i hope trump will comply in the destruction of and keep away that have damaged our country so the wall is also for the it could fall from power and give way to a government that needs so badly the fall of the government without the support of would be hope that trump will comply in the destruction

northern trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will the shit out of but including appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes will he will he cities where millions of civilians is he prepared to deploy us ground what will he do as seems both sieges become bogged or begins daily executions of is also silent about significant military intervention in and

in the burgeoning tech and service sectors in the big cities driven by global but they care they are hurting and nobody has taken decisive action to help them the votes for trump and mark the end of an era and a new dark age of protectionism and will insist that this is a travesty of their they want to access more global trade and not be they crazily by the confines of the union and its bureaucratic inability to cut aggressive trade deals with the rest of the world they live in a dreamland if they feel that the rest of the world is more committed to free trade than while membership did not hold back from being among the major any apart from the promised closure of borders to that is not what their voters as always better understood than any of his allies he cordially despises voters in south and the west midlands want the same as their counterparts in and after it was those three with their tiny 100 , 000 vote which gave trump the electoral college votes for victory he might be a but he or at least styles a workers benefit from free trade and as he has consistently said for 18 in the teeth of opposition from the republican mainstream who remain free traders his as he called wants to stop both exchange and intermingling are the lifeblood of that along the border was one of the most insistent chants at his along with the forced deportation of 11 million illegal immigrants but more importantly for the international trading trump wants to withdraw from the north free trade agreement between the and which he casually dismisses as the trade deal in he also wants an immediate halt in negotiations for both the transatlantic and trade agreements and unilaterally he wants to impose swingeing against the rules of the world trade from which he is prepared to on which account for half of the trade deficit per cent tariffs are promised on imports the remaining 20 agreements the us has signed are to be reviewed or abrogated the impact would be killing by exposing the already enfeebled as inciting and trade retaliation and the entire global system of trade and say that trump the president will be much more cautious and realist than trump the his talk on trade should be seen as threats to produce more fairly balanced not a tearing up of the world system maybe but there cannot be a complete divorce between campaign rhetoric and policy he believes what he says and nobody in his close coterie is going to urge caution not his senior trade who has promised a potential in the first six months of the trump from every major us trade deal if it cannot be shown actively to benefit the us era of trade deficits is he says will but otherwise we put tariffs has said trump will go to ground on every trade such as the one with south that the described as

deeply held view that the us does not need trade except on terms that put first the idea that successive administrations have negotiated deals loaded in the us interest is impossible to concede because how else would he explain the rust there can be no concession that jobs are disappearing with or without trade because of and automation the of the and has disappeared for ever and destroying the international trading system is not going to bring it of that cuts any ice with a demagogic populist trump has promises to keep to a that expects no less the last time a republican president and his party controlled both the house of representatives and senate with the same convictions on first trade was 1928 there were warnings that introducing the tariffs on imports in 1930 would trigger a

growth will stop in its tracks for at least two years the prospects could be even worse if trump goes further already world trade growth over the last year has been the slowest for the last 15 even introducing the mildest of measures must presage a further deceleration and if he goes as far as he promises walking away from the world trade withdrawing from multiple trade agreements and freely imposing tariffs then the prospect of a implosion is all too this the foreign babbling alongside other about the opportunities for trade deals with the us is surreal to exit the the one continent pledged to open in order to plunge into a world trade system threatened by collapse is the height of folly if voters had known trump was going to be president in and known of his attitude to trade remain would have won comfortably parliament may find it has a duty to veto the application to exercise article 50 before the end of the referendum was only ever advisory and attitude to trade changes of the many tragedies of the rise of is that the promotion of international trade has been able to be portrayed by some on the left as part of the same portfolio of policies as and assaulting trade

it is no use pretending presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it at least in a victory for prejudice and for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of will ultimately confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be explanations have been offered for defeat last week all have an element of truth for she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past not least in respect of the foundation in many she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an sense of entitlement there was her ambiguous legacy and was a reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her the complacency of the democratic party and liberal too comfortable after eight safe years of did a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation for the most did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then with to give him too easy a these factors contributed to demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white men and women who comprise of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns the determining factors were not education or not religion or not sexual predations or entanglements they were race and linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all suburban and that inclusive and was not working for were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its moorings as frank said in these pages last democrats went from being the party of town in to the party of vineyard of the and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan great what he was really saying was white when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a when he minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their the subliminal message was always the fear of the foreigner in conjured the illusion of a return to a society of secure safe and agreed values no wonder and other minorities are frightened no wonder us relations around the globe are in turmoil and populists and hard are celebrating no wonder observers speak of the end of the west and the demise of liberal democracy has stormed the shining city on a betrayed the founding fathers who stood tall for human dignity and universal rights and now presages an isolationist made in image a beacon of discrimination and are the peculiarities of the electoral system to too won a majority of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in 2013 when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of 1965 by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting such as south to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the what has been happening in north a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black who disproportionately there were numerous other examples across the including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the leader of the free world to allow voter suppression is beyond supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that like the billionaire is much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no says he will cut raise public spending and slash the federal deficit impossible all at once trump says he will renegotiate or scrap and other treaties but his conceit that this will help uncompetitive in or in is says he will slap swingeing tariffs on but he knows the geopolitical and commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make strong and its then kowtows to the most formidable strategic and undermines he says he will be best friend but his campaign was not above antisemitic trump voters really believe the border wall they need a reality check the power of us presidents to act unilaterally in or any other domestic is extremely circumscribed trump would face endless legal challenges and he would need agreement and funding from prospect that much of what trump has promised or threatened will not happen is welcome perhaps the responsibilities of office will temper his worst producing a the incoherence and contradictory nature of his economic ideas for boosting growth and jobs and moribund industrial areas suggest his grassroots supporters are destined for disappointment economic performance is what will ultimately define the trump has plenty of other horrors in while volatile personality and inexperience add extreme at home and to a host of other worries trump now has the opportunity to stack the supreme court with conservative reactionaries like himself that will pose a direct threat to abortion despite his earlier support for roe v wade in his latest trump appeared to soften his hostility to reforms his pledge to abolish them outright was a central plank of his campaign what he will eventually do remains as he postures as the champion of ordinary working trump intends to cut corporate taxes and ease bank regulation who knows how he will react if a north challenges his narcissism and fabrications are the watchwords as trump readies

for 240 has toyed with the idea of a woman becoming president this for an all too brief it looked as if the idea might become a reality but the dream of a female president has remained just a disingenuous myth occasionally serves up in but never permits to spill into its facts instead of witnessing the landmark moment of a woman moving into the oval we can now see the misogyny that became a feature of the 2016 presidential campaign bedding down in the corridors of power when trump called a in the final only a few days after a series of recordings revealed him admitting to a series of sexual aggressions and many people thought it was the end of his bid for the presidency social media during election night revealed trump supporters male and female voicing the view that a woman is simply not capable of being too weak to stand up to foreign leaders and the sucker punch for those of us who believe that this particular woman was spectacularly more ready for the white house than her grossly and abusive opponent is that as has historically been the case once a female candidate did not carry even the female vote a staggering of white women voted against and for the man whose statements and attitudes brought kicking and into the light twitter concession speech in conceded the she tried to offer hope to the especially the young of know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass but i know someday someone and hopefully sooner than we might think right of we may not think that right because right now the media is focusing its attention on economic and racial it is not interested in the of but that is also the story of this which was fought over a series of myths and outright two solid the media engaged in spreading and misinformation about the first serious female candidate for president for a few days after we learned that trump likes to grab women the the mainstream media began admitting how many of the derogatory stories swirling around were how many were literally fictions but then the and the story reverted to its misogynistic relentlessly informing the electorate that is untrustworthy it was character and it who still believes these claims are factual and on the some 59 million people do should consider how closely they resemble the stories that have always been told about female both real and fictional to do so is to that it is time to stop as some commentators are that failed us the truth we failed understand a you must know its stories taking a hard look at some of the tales told about the idea of a female president can teach us a great deal about this as well as those to come the women who have become presidents in the history of fiction are not quite as vanishingly scarce as they are in but not exactly numerous until very the fictions were as presumptively white as the candidates just 14 women have mounted a serious bid for us three of whom made it to a major national although only one secured that nomination five became third party and two became major party running both of whom lost we have had three female secretaries of one female speaker of the house but no woman has ever been elected to the executive branch of the idea of a woman in the white house has always prompted the same it is either a a disaster or a cheat was endlessly called to shouts of her although her crimes always varied had she murdered or had she covered up wrongdoing in the deaths of at stolen or was in it matter what mattered was the idea of illegitimacy most stories imagine a female president who murders or sleeps her way into or inherits the fictions about women becoming president have always worked to invalidate the very idea for the novel by a former speaker of the house and avowed enemy of newt which tells of a woman who becomes first woman president and chooses politics over national resulting in a style its now has been tipped for a cabinet because propaganda neither history nor fiction are there more than a handful of stories that imagine a female president who could ascend to the highest office in the land through merit and hard instead she either murders or sleeps her way into or she inherits the from a man fictional depictions of a female presidential candidate on the actual campaign trail are even this may correlate with the fact as herself she was always more popular in office than while running when female presidents are they are in office thanks to a of some which is also power was handed to or she inveigled her way into it either crooked just like fiction is a club into which women presidents admitted they are segregated by cropping up primarily in satire or science female presidents are a or exist in an alternate reality women are disproportionately more likely to become president in disaster movies and because only when large segments of the human race are eradicated do we imagine women in charge in early science fiction the apocalypse often took the form of the nullification of as real political gains sent masculinity into an imaginary crisis from which it has not the any writing that considered the possibility of a woman president focused not on what it would mean to but on what it would mean to men even when written by a woman what seems to be the earliest fictional depiction of a female presidential candidate was a burlesque provoked by the first woman who ran in beecher published narrated by a man who thinks he supports rights until he meets who wants to be president her name your says it she is aggressive and a unwomanly amphibious loud and vulgar by no she is also accused of swindling and fraud she singlehandedly we are whole woman for the main argument for proposing was to introduce into politics that superior delicacy and which women manifest in family it was her fault if feminism take because she was doing such a bad job at representing should sound because it is a very persistent pretends it is perfectly comfortable with the ideal of a female only to discover that it is disappointed or horrified by every human woman it encounters words like enter the story when women fail to that women should cleanse politics with their purity was the view taken by beecher who made the news in 1888 by predicting would soon see a woman the men would vote for her out of pure gallantry and not quite how it played out women even get the vote until when the 19th amendment was ratified newspapers instantly produced satirical visions of women marching into the white house one imagined the inauguration of the first woman will be a parade

thanks everyone for taking part this and for all your comments keep the page open for longer but we are heading off been a long hope everyone enjoys their and see you next about that question from earlier 11 2016 says that it was may who called trump talked to trump earlier on a downing street statement said it added that the prime minister called congratulate him on his election campaign and and confirmed may had been invited to visit the us soon as he did n't call but she called in the know colleague seems to have more guardian staff 11 2016 were being told today by one of the senior who is trust on this that it works that way world leaders frantically phone him and they choose who to put through 11 2016 mean everyone phones the new us president at the same time and he chooses what call to take first and trump talked to another ten people before talking to think find a substitute for my 2016 in a week that feature a great deal of there was one topic that unified the divided nation the outrageous changes to the shape of our beloved chocolate the most read list on the news site was reassuringly marks then the us election the people know where their priorities lie got to be honest i always thought that was something that people only ever bought in a panic at airports if forgotten to get someone a gift when they were abroad 08 2016 always thought they made triangular so it fits in the of it unify us for long there had to be a just got real via argued that it summed up easy to scoff at the fact that it takes food to act as a focal point for what is happening in this when there is so much that has been truly awful about this hate the immediate retraction of a promise of extra funding all of these things should be more alarming than a slightly smaller chocolate or a pricier snack but all of these things have become part of a ominous collective sigh that has summed up the past few months 2016 has been defined by a creeping sense of dread that all the progress humanity has made over the past few decades if feeling particularly might be about to then she was writing in the golden era before trump was elected and we found out that had died in a week that brought us closer to had our own reasons to feel that droning mix of fear and a inquiry concluded that the austerity policies amounted to of disabled rights the work and pensions dismissed the scathing report as and to disabled people which is because say the conservatives telling paraplegics and cancer patients that being forced to pay the bedroom tax whilst having their disability benefit cut and social care removed really as bad as you is the definition of and offensive been a lot of talk of a possible future president in but this reader see 11 2016 astonished to see people quite seriously expressing hope that will run next time all the stuff about writers hoping to tell their daughters that they could be president just like was undermined by her surname dynasties are part of the this article suggests it likely to happen is unlikely to run for president read more world leaders have begun congratulating trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president was the first global leader to speak to trump on the phone he was also one of the first to congratulate him publicly after a meeting in new in where he met both trump and he described trump as strong trump in turn called fantastic victory has divided society some are relieved to see who they believe supported the brotherhood lose others are and fear the repercussions of his win as part of a community project we asked people in to share their thoughts with us what they was more than thrilled by his win as a fascist be concerned much with the state of human rights his support will directly result in more bloodshed and more violations of law and human rights in the controls the most powerful office in the this will give a huge push to all the in the world talking about the extremist terrorist movements electing an as a president is going to feed more and more the image those movements are trying to spread about the us as the biggest devil in the and will further inflate the violence and terrorism this will only help increase the instability and the warfare in the and maybe the whole live in a police state where activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of but i doubt administration will do the same this is evident from our current eagerness to connect with and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by and while trump is openly hostile to and clueless about the policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her more tolerant and inclusive is it time to take a step 11 2016 was elected he was practically hailed as the second coming of remember it people crying in people hugging in the the world was going to be a better fairer place what absolutely the same old same the rich got richer the poor we have the situation in it looks like the have elected the and its going to be the end of the will have to wait and but i think that neither one is so bad or the other one was so good w response to the news this week was one of the most simultaneously heartwarming and tight to the ones you please he because all got is each it seems to be a thought that occurred to quite a few of my friends at the same time the worst has my friend are terrified and just wanted to say that i love you and if you think about a hopeful response to an otherwise hopeless event someone you love them in the face of events that negate brotherly love is a small but resolute instance of resistance now a worth of reading cookbooks on a daily basis for my job has made one thing clear people who love to love to share and the one thing they share more than anything is a love of feeding people and the belief that cooking a meal for someone is bold and an act of true love wrote a book called stirring slowly this which is full of the kind of warming meals you just want to come home to on a cold night she talks about food that heals so you know invite each other round to dinner make for colleagues bring cakes into offices and flapjacks into classrooms take care of each other eat together i interviewed photographers taken pictures of trump throughout his and it struck me just how malleable the is one of the described trump as being very different in person from his public charming but said he was exactly the same as in that what you see is what you get the two photos were admittedly taken a decade but the disparity in their stories seems to suggest that trump is even more that we to the point of never having a stable version of a man who makes up his life as he goes powered by a kind of narcissism and presumptuousness photographers on their best trump think he 's a damaged read do you think of is he a what do you make of his change of tone since being share your views below a 11 2016 trump phone may or the other way certainly seem to be at the front of the queue went outside to discover a trump sign on my in a window that did not have that sign on were the closet trump a question been hearing again and again in the past few days i heard it at an election night party for students of alma mater a student there told me that no one had been a vocal trump supporter among the student but as the returns rolled she wondered how of them must have be closet trump fans i heard it talking to cultural critic who looked at the strong support for trump among white women exit polls suggested of white women voted for trump and concluded that it was very difficult to say no one who was theoretically on the left voted for win came as a shock to many now wondering who supported him all simply did not talk about it for some a source of anxiety at a protest in a young woman told the post that she was deeply upset by the people who had voted for trump see people differently now i smile at people on the street anymore because you never she said did voters feel the same sense of shock that there might be closet supporters who had been around them all the do you have any advice for who are devastated by this stages of mourning a
world leaders have begun congratulating trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president the order in which trump spoke to leaders around the world has sparked speculation as to how he will shape his foreign policy in the 24 hours after his victory trump spoke to and south the may was 11th on the action planned after second night of protests across us read was the first to have a conversation on how to closer diplomatic with the us prime discussed regional security and how to defeat a key promise in election campaign but although the and the offered they his leadership a of asked people around the world to tell us what the situation looks like from where they how their governments are responding to victory and how they think his leadership will affect their and the us will probably grow closer but as citizens we will suffer from endorsement of our live in a police state where activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of but i doubt administration will do the same this is evident from our current eagerness to connect with trump i hope he hires a team that understands the complexities of the middle east it is evident he does n't have a and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by and while trump is openly hostile to and clueless about the policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her more tolerant and inclusive gone through a very similar election scenario in in 2012 where both candidates were i was not very surprised by the outcome the democratic party underestimated popularity and the dislike for i feel a lot of votes went to trump out of spite for perhaps if a different candidate had gone against trump the outcome would have been different just like what happened in it looks like the population is now sharply split in with each side the other i think the most dangerous thing that can happen to a intolerant people in power might make it easier to challenge them as they are now out in the but healing the rifts in society is much harder i simply hope trump will become a president for all us as is his and reign in the hateful extremist tendencies displayed by white hope he hires a competent team that understands the complexities of the situation in the middle east and as it is evident that he does not have a trade conflicts but he will use his business wisdom to deal with feel great about the result a tremendous win for the for those who were constantly ignored by political elites in i like trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct us is divided probably more divided than when i worked there for three years that happens when you are obsessed with gay rights and minority rights but forget to promote the most basic right of living a better life for the majority he will be a great president if he improve some of his to plot and the are now dead trump is likely to be a more pragmatic figure than so relations will improve going to be some trade conflicts if trump lives up to his word about but i believe he will use his business wisdom to deal with it china will have an easier situation and a stronger influence in the region a cooperation between these two countries could benefit humankind i wish that trump could be more presidential he will be a great president if he improves some of his rhetoric i hope that he can get along with have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from say the result was shocking would be an understatement victory of an fanatic like in a country known around the world for its liberal virtues and is something that adds to the swerve of the world to the right he adds on to the list of politicians such as in in and of in maybe we are witnessing the gradual transition of the world into a global we have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from parties another moment of jubilation for them maybe the consequences for foreign policy will be beneficial as trump has publicly shown his admiration for and his way of governance but his temperamental nature makes trump truly so we will have to wait and see as long as he turn rhetoric into i think the world will be southern where most of the people have a similar opinion to me but in the northern areas of the stomping ground of the ruling opinions may differ the philosophy of of a mutual peaceful which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime is something i firmly believe and the rise of a person like trump is a question mark on existence itself the hidden silent majority that is supposed to have created this ruckus may not be as silent as they are portrayed to be as in every other some are always bound to feel during the rule of a government they which could be for cultural or economical reasons beyond doubt this result was the result of what they call some sort of racial hate storm against the former policy on terrorism and the domestic election helped me to see what the us truly is under the pop culture disguise they have a huge rising tide of fanatics and a population desperate enough to find hope in them maybe his campaign of rhetoric and hate was a charade to reign in their support as long as he limits himself to rhetoric and dare turn rhetoric into i think the world will be of the few things politicians agreed on was to openly reject trump has been hostile to our so i am not optimistic about having a fluid relationship with the us his proposals against make it really difficult to support and trump mark a politicians must not pander to it read government made it clear that it supported i am really worried about the impact this will have on our future society is fragmented as there is a strong division between the actual and former government but one of the few things politicians agreed on was to openly reject us now has a president who is who openly supports and illegal who hates who thinks climate change was invented by china to make us industries less competitive what can go has been always a very progressive nation we have many but one of our main characteristics is that we are open to different religions or race discrimination like but here we face integration or at least not like in other parts of the voted for him because he said the things that many of them think trump is a clear representation of the average and that was like a kind of dangerous homer it also shows how unhappy they are with the political types of leaders that are spreading around the world are setting in a new with policies that i think compromise worldwide security they are on the rise because of need for an answer to but the only thing they achieve is to deepen and create a more segregated and unfair have been humiliated in front of the power trump has over us over our our our perception of our freedom of over the way the world will see us is and he is not even the president future deportations of many who live and work in the us who send money and who contribute tremendously in that way to our will probably send us into an even deeper recession we have been humiliated in front of the we woke up to find the exchange rate at 20 50 pesos for the dollar we went from 18 70 per dollar on election day to 20 20 on and 20 50 on expected to reach 30 by the end of the are more than willing to welcome in any who wishes to make their home for the next four years bring your come live bring your help us out we are a welcoming country with amazing fantastic great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and we hope they will seriously consider it that goes for people who want to escape the our collective us democracy was something to aspire to this is something that has changed the spell has been broken in many ways we are disappointed in even the least educated among us believe this man to be a his ideas to be uninspired and poorly that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen we made fun of him we are surprised by how much and how many love adore are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology should now inspire ask this us generally does the same thing no matter in the result might have been but hardly going to change anything in south our government is already pandering to trump as they would to being subservient and uncritical is all the administration will even if the us government starts to deport i hope they freeze out the government and treat it with the insignificance it course you worry that such an election might make extremists feel entitled to commit hate crimes on the other the us generally does the same thing no matter in voted as it was the others who bother voting as they feel by the politics that won it it is something we know quite well in too this is not someone fit for office this is someone who needs could see the relations being much less friendly than they have been really hard to know at this point in time how presidency will affect i think it will have a big impact on our economy because the us is our main economic this is where we export the majority of our goods and trump wants to get rid of our prime minister said he would work with but the truth is they have very conflicting views on almost so i could see the relations being much less friendly than they have been lately with trump as people all over the globe are in danger i am scared and i am sad sad to see so many people showing showing hate towards their every talked to or who has posted on social media seems to think the same and the age of popular 2016 in long reads read man is devoid of common sense or a sense of he thinks better than jokes about assaulting which we know he he thinks too smart to file his taxes this is not someone fit for office this is someone who needs biggest concern for and all nations is how trump will behave towards 39 if senses weakness or he will take full advantage and seek to further and the he will finance populist movements across the as well as launching military operations where advantageous to interests in that the might need to look to china as its only powerful ally in of global stability a really sad big concern is that the us will tear up its climate change commitments and its rapprochement with both would be highly disadvantageous to and interests in working towards global conflict reduction the overwhelming majority of are worried about the trump presidency have pinned their hopes on a who a politician to fix the precise same system that produced him in the first place that is why both and the foreign have been lukewarm in their reactions to say the least i am saddened but not surprised after showed that complacency has created a significant percentage of protest voters who wish to destroy the current economic order even without a coherent alternative the us is now deeply divided into two the trump camp that is predominantly and the other that has a high percentage of ethnic minorities that racial divide is deeply worrying mood here is one of shock and fear for the know that nationalist parties all across believe their luck the middle ground has shifted to the right i hope that moderate leaders take heed and produce a backed by that is much like the shows how vulnerable democracies are to simple populist arguments when the circumstances are right in both the us and the the vote was decided by a tranche of voters whose lives have more despair than hope for the future i am bitterly disappointed with both but the leaders on the losing side did not articulate any policies that would give the voters hope for change they badly misread the mood of the left behinds the much like the shows how vulnerable democracies are to simple populist and cracking very dark jokes about the end of the it is only going to encourage supporters of marine pen in the upcoming elections in it is going to make the relationship with the and that much more friends are trying to keep business as usual and not discuss it in cracking very dark jokes about the end of the world but then the memory in is regardless of their political all my acquaintances are horrified that the us has chosen such an inexperienced person and failed businessman because his have not been stable or profitable for anyone but himself his language and his lack of control are hope he does not influence other world leaders to become more like him or dominant and ultimately ineffective heads of repressive countries i hope that he does not commit nepotism while in the but rather use best business practices although that is very preparing for the because all the historical and economic signs point to a very dark elections on on via on on on on on this

trump has invited may to and affirmed his belief in the special relationship between the and the us the invitation came in first conversation with the trump reportedly spoke to nine other world leaders before he spoke to but number 10 sources have said there was no urgent need for a the has announced plans to strengthen links between the and shanghai stock exchanges he was speaking at a press conference with the vice ma says china and the are enjoying a and are taking their relationship to a new level the former has denounced trump as a misogynistic but also set out three lessons progressive parties can learn from his election victory all from me for today i have to get to a school which is late for the comments this is from the harry trump special wants to bilateral trade and be to invite her to 2016 this is from the evening gather invited may to visit as soon as possible and it would be a great to welcome her to 2016 may has spoken to trump this is from ship minister had her conversation with president elect at time this 2016 it is worth noting that of the three lessons that ed thinks progressives need to learn from trump two are ones that has already embraced policy agenda is not and he can credibly pose as an outsider but he is not particularly comfortable championing nationalism or patriotism ed the former was on the world at one talking about trump he expressed horror at politics like and this he accepted that trump won support because people were rightly fed up with the economic status said that he thought he had a of this problem when he was leader of the party but that his solutions were obviously sufficiently he lost the general since then appears to have given the subject more thought because in his interview he offered some fresh thinking on how political parties could respond to these challenges it was one of the most interesting interventions heard from any politician since election here are the key identified three lessons that progressive politicians could learn from the success of trump parties like needed to offer big stop defending the system like insiders and embrace he said i think there are deep lessons and what are the first of all the economic because whatever you say about trump and they offer big solutions i think they are false and we should not invent false gods of our own but our solutions are too incremental and not big enough for the diagnosis of inequality and the problems that we being political insiders is a massive problem trump was the outsider and i do think in a sense that got him permission to be heard and i think we have to think very hard about how we defend the broken politics that people but actually want to change this issue of nationhood and patriotism and the truth is that trump has invented a nasty view of but we yet have a convincing one of our own simply defending openness on its without has been proved to be deeply insufficient he said had failed we should certainly be saying has failed the current economic system does not work it has accrued the gains to the top and people have got squeezed and left said following the he accepted that there would have to be some controls on the free movement of citizens into the politicians had to understand he said having seen the referendum we have if at all to see some change in relation to free said that he still believed in and the advantages of the single but that this needed to be combined with fairness described trump as misogynistic and said people should be about his election the idea that we have shared values with a misogynistic groper beggars think we should be deeply worried about the implications for many of the things that we care tackling climate he says invented by the and a dealing with problems in the middle he says going to almost immediately the capital of with all kinds of implications that has for the middle east peace his attitude to and then this fantasy about trade this guy is anti an odd combination of protectionism plus the old tax cut formula that has got us into a lot of this mess in the first said election was symptomatic of a in ed will the has suggested that

adviser and a minister occasionally the anecdotes are a bit but the book is exceptionally readable and anyone interested in learning about the craft of politics will find it riveting with his strong plea for a politics combining social justice with faith in the balls also emerges from the book sounding like the very last survivor of new one of the important lessons in politics over two decades is that not only common for people to hold two seemingly contradictory opinions at the same but it also makes a good deal of when i think of the conversations had with voters in recent i recall people ranting about the bankers and what they had done to the economy and how angry they were about it but when the same people would agree that banks are important for our economy and just want them to work better in the not to be permanently weakened they know they matter for their savings and and for and more widely for jobs and wealth creation in the economy from before it was my job to the

the pursuit of urban exploration has always been but largely as a result of the oneupmanship generated by social media the risks taken by young breed of explorers are reaching new and terrifying extremes they are not just descending into sewers but climbing risking their lives in train and tube and indulging in photogenic stunts in an effort to win instant community has changed says author of explore the city lot of these kids are putting themselves at greater risk to gain credibility on social media channels there have been an increased number of deaths in the community worldwide in the past few and gone with the increased desire to publish these exploits on social a geographer at is the most prominent writer on the explore which drew on a study of and was published in could be said to have put this pastime on the map he penetrated the world of urban exploration which is an odd combination of the secretive and the brash and set about understanding what motivates urban old and virtual reality the city gives you a chance to understand it in a different tells me are able to see the abandoned the infrastructural the construction all the things that comprise the city an addictive quality to because once you start going into these spaces and understanding the city in a different very hard to fall back into normal talks about the sense of urban exploration provides a very particular kind of agency that comes from using the body to get into spaces that not supposed to he that translates very easily into a kind of breaking into spaces an explicitly political act there is usually no attempt to change anything specific but in an it feels like a way of kicking against the also fraught with difficulty and danger in and several fellow explorers were arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit criminal damage have any evidence that we had committed any criminal so they charged us with a thought he says the case dragged on for two and he was eventually given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs of i reflect on the whole he says that the trauma we were subjected to was actually the point what the transport police wanted to do was stop me from publishing photos the sites and stop me from writing about this because what we did undermined their narrative of had demonstrated that the impenetrable world was not so secret or impenetrable after all twitter at the top of power station in reckons there are around 100 active urban explorers in perhaps a few thousand in the and tens of thousands across the concentrated in major cities and often communicating with explorers elsewhere they share information and photographs on urban exploration websites such as 28 days and even stage events such as the international drain where popular term for committed sewer admits urban explorers are mostly but claims it is more diverse than mountain climbing or scuba diving he dislikes what he calls the growing of the with explorers building up a profile by performing some stunt in a thereby attracting sponsors for their next undertaking attempt at radical expression becomes he says a who says he has been an urban explorer since his early gives me a somewhat less view he grew up near a closed asylum in south and used to enjoy sneaking in with his mates as he got he added layers of planning to every goes out in a small and puts great emphasis on the research that real requires he explores construction utility and new projects such as the lee tunnel he clearly sees the tideway as another target rich in possibility once construction he enjoys he is circumventing security the challenge of getting in that really interests me it even have to be that interesting a space once in twitter there are around 100 active urban explorers in and tens of thousands across the world is about the political dimension claims for urban exploration mainly do it because he says no more politically motivated than any other except that the people who engage in it are more willing to break the any he it is possible to see many of these locations on private tours that is the whole idea of open to give the public access to the usually inaccessible but the urban explorer wants access on his own terms if he or she does get they may well want to keep it to themselves climbing on to rooftops helps you make sense of the city watching it twist and turn year by are places people have accessed but never posted the photographs only because the legal repercussions could be but also because if anyone else knows those places are accessible that could heat the place up very few people are really trying to these goes exploring at least one night a week he says construction sites are usually but other locations are very tricky and need a lot of reconnaissance and perhaps a few failed attempts before you work out how to get in he like to go out in a group of more than any more would be too too he is wary of the generation of who explore in order to post pictures on and build up their celebrity think bothered about the challenge of getting into these or take an interest in the history of who built this tunnel and why for them in get this picture and they just want to rack up likes and followers increasingly more about the while the experience takes a back became a bit of a junkie for evening i meet another young who offers to take me on an exploration a nice easy one since new to the game in his early tells me he started as a graffiti got to hear about people term he prefers to my throwaway graffiti in abandoned mental and joined was exactly the kind of atmosphere i was looking and i became a bit of a junkie for he says was like stepping into the certain places you found had everything left in as if somebody had just walked out of that door one day and left everything been on tours across and other places to see old castles and manor houses where people have left all of their belongings including even their which you can rummage through to piece together lives but this fleeting chance be there some hooligan will find their way in and steal or set it on twitter an urban explorer inside the abandoned steel plant on the outskirts of for the ask him where he stands on whether urban exploration can be interpreted as a political act majority of people taking part in mainstream urban exploration are he says are people around the world doing it for the right reasons uncovering fantastic history and gems that been seen before but a lot of it is quite lazy tourism somebody finds a and then everybody else rushes after it with their big lenses and photographs the crap out of it and rushes home to their computer to badly the images on urban exploration tourism is quite he makes it sound like competitive has had his own with the law he asks me not to reveal exactly why ending up with a conditional discharge and in costs after one particularly spectacular incident these days he is concentrating on getting on to roofs he is especially interested in locations used by pirate radio stations and that is where he intends to take go to a tower block in central where he has been before he produces a skeleton key to get into the building he says fire services have access to master and that relatively easy to obtain copies of them and we take the lift to the top the only obstacle is a quietly unhook the ladder

this he says like the geometry of this the twinkling lights and the chance to see some of the old terraced housing which has been obscured by more modern buildings you can look across to north and see the hills all laid out before your almost as if you could pick up the buildings a says a vantage point such as this makes you rethink the way different parts of the city fit together on to rooftops like this is a way of feeling your way around making sense of it all watching it twist and turn year by i quite share his epiphany i still worry that someone will close the skylight behind or that the

shock to place in the world it will sever old links and require new ones to be forged as some of its keenest proponents this transition will bring painful costs most of all it demands lots of good will and flexibility on all sides in so far as win means a more more volatile global it raises those costs and shrinks that space for compromise and consensus essential for a smooth the damage of a trump presidency on a demands ambition and perspective from may her approach should be build a closer alliance with not just on but on wider the world and china in and other capitals officials

dignity we must find our way to a prosperity which gives people a greater sense of where communities have more autonomy to judge their own and where international cooperation is used to tackle the worst excesses of including tax human trafficking and illegal do we need a new language of politics one that refuses to pander to prejudice but that what the social psychologist calls the which those

has issued this statement the establishment is in deep shock even more so than after what we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives voters across the western world want nation state proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives i commend trump for the courage with which he has fought this campaign and i look forward to a closer

presidential election night party at the us embassy last night conservative mp minister for the northern described victory as glorious moment for at an event by marketing at football club on was in the us election just had this massive election and great to see so many people have turned out to vote in what is the greatest democracy in the just to see the enthusiasm with which people have gone to the polls the former first minister who has had dealings with trump because his administration approved plans for golf course near told sky news that he was by election he said he hoped being president changed trump trump could be as when he was getting his own said but the electoral campaign showed what he could be like when he was facing news says mp about the result 2016 government departments have form for using big news like the us presidential as cover for the release of potentially embarrassing information and true to departments are releasing information about the and special gifts and have not gone through the but i will let you know if anything good crops up the prime has recorded a clip for the broadcasters about election she essentially just read with minor the statement she issued earlier it was not an but she did take one question on reporter asked may if she thought trump was a fit person to be given what he said in the campaign about and about his plans and would may be able to work with she i look forward to working with trump the people have elected him as the next president of the united states and the united states share values of freedom and

commented on election earlier she managed to combine an ostensibly friendly message of support with an implicit rebuke to trump for the stance he took during the campaign on matters like diversity and the rule of law not torturing wood dignified principled statement on the us election result from the new leader of the free contrast is quite sent out a signal that she would be willing to challenge trump in of some of the key values of may mean may may feel just as strongly about equality etc as she most probably does but she has evidently decided that is not in her or the interests to go public on these concerns at this stage that is not particularly given the obsession successive governments have had with maintaining close ties with but may could find that on this she is out of step with public opinion may sky news the north east of is famous for its parochial newspaper headlines most journalists have heard the story about how the journal covered the sinking of the titanic under the

website grateful to for the headline observer this is from in the leadership to trump president elect his acceptance speech was a measured call for unity bodes well for the 2016 in a post on his only claims policy platform is much more centrist than people think who is much more liberal and than the says he thinks trump could end up persuading congress to adopt a new big government an extract in his acceptance the talked about new infrastructure creating new jobs that idea is reminiscent of the in that is it harks back to new throughout the trump has drawn policies from both left and right he has taken protectionism from the and a tougher stance on immigration from the republicans he has attacked political at the same ignored much of the socially conservative culture war he has pledged to cut but not to cut might explain how trump has managed to do what no other republican presidential candidate has done since the run the table across the rust belt danger is having promised presidency just brings more of the same borrowing to fund infrastructure and entitlements will come at a huge cost stimulus usually produce the kind of sustainable economic boom trump has promised at it for for that the irony is after years of gridlock between the president and it could be the man democrats despise more than any other who enables bipartisanship with trump in the white republicans in congress may end up backing a agenda similar to the one they have trenchantly opposed for much of the last eight years here is is more reaction to victory from the shadow business lewis mp u think now might be the time to show a little humility how the contributed to this the shadow justice mp worrying that trump given what he has said and given what he has done elected as leader of the most powerful

the unthinkable is only unthinkable until it happens like the sack of it can seem historically inevitable so it is with the global political earthquake that is the election of trump as the next president of the united states if he is true to his campaign which were many and win will herald most stunning reversal of political and economic orthodoxy since the new deal in the but with the opposite intention and effect it halts the ailing progressive narrative about modern and the world in its tracks it signals a seismic rupture in the global liberal economic and political order that had seemed to command the 21st century after communism collapsed and economy that the trump triumph has echoes of the increasingly alarming general rightward shift in the politics of other western to which progressives have again produced inadequate responses the parallel with vote is obvious and real is the further boost that the trump triumph may hand to nationalists in many parts of marine pen jumped quickly on that bandwagon the result will be lamented by liberals across and beyond but it will be cheered in and which will feel emboldened this is not a good week to be a or a and another dire one to be a the result is also a generational challenge to progressive politics to find the radical and credible message that eludes them in so many not just in taken this is primarily an catastrophe that has brought upon itself when it came to the us was unable to find a credible way of rallying against trump and what he represents failed that crucial test both in herself and in what she for her this is the end but she was the not the cause trump was not taken seriously and was widely not expected to beat throughout the bitter campaign at each his candidacy was deemed certain to crash and burn the opinion polls and the vaunted probability calculus rarely trended in his both are now discredited only after the less than two weeks before the was it widely imagined that the tables might turn in nevertheless by the eve of poll trump was again the trump won big in an election if the exit polls were most people made up their minds long before the furore victory was total it was more than anything on the white irrespective of age or white people mostly voted for him it was the most stunning upset in modern us not even a squeaker he won most of the battleground states into which the campaign had poured money north and en route to a decisive republican electoral college total exceeding 300 that majority is on the flyover which inhabitants of the big democratic bastions on the coasts often only see from 35 , 000 feet but the red tide pushed north deep into the and consolidated in the south although the electoral college system amplified is set to win the popular as democrats have in every election bar one since republican congressional candidates who had scrabbled to put distance between themselves and their nominee after the ugly debates found themselves riding to victory on coattails republicans held most of their seats in the senate and will be the chance to extend their majority in when the beneficiaries of the wave of 2012 face the voters more the house remained firmly in republican hands speaker and his lieutenants have more to fear from their own party grassroots and from a perhaps vengeful new man in the white house than they do from the shattered for whom this outcome is the sum of all trump is the shock heard round the world now that he has the instant explanations have already started to flood that the of this or that demographic was that he tapped the angry that he spoke for millions who felt abandoned by the prosperous and that was always far stronger than liberals wanted to that he was a celebrity candidate for the that he rode the tiger of that making great again was a message in a militaristic and imperial that white men many white had had it with political that misogyny swung that the mainstream media failed to call him that it is a verdict on the that was always the wrong that there was racist dirty work in the voting that it was the who won it for him twitter highlights from presidential victory of these explanations are irrelevant all of them have something to say but beware of instant certainties as with in the immediate aftermath of a huge a period of careful and reflection is in order this is not to diminish the immense seriousness of what happened on nor is it to understate the anxieties about what lies ahead as steps back and trump takes particular fears now stand out the first is the unleashing of an unbridled conservative agenda in now that the republicans control the white house and capitol hill a rare thing in the past hundred years in her dignified concession speech rightly the need to defend democratic she might have drawn attention to president legacy on and climate change too trump and the congressional republicans have he is more prepared to use the power of government than many of them are but they have a clear path now towards reshaping the supreme court and dozens of judicial benches in their own image the effect on gender and issues is likely to outlast period in office the culture wars will reopen abortion rights are second is the impact of this result on race in more widely trump campaigned against migrants and against insulted black and launched ads that some saw as covertly and was cheered to victory by every white racist in the land his voters a echo again will want him to deliver every action he takes in this area threatens to divide and inflame after a of uneven but undeniable racial progress in the consequences of every attempt to turn back the clock could be third fear is whether trump has any economic plan that will deliver for some of the poor communities that gave him their votes so solidly trump connected with the anger that many poor and white voters feel but what can he really do about what do most congressional republicans care about he can try to put up all the protectionist walls he likes that will please his supporters but it is difficult to see how he can bring old mills and factories back to life a lot of feel left behind and let down trump is playing with fire in the it becomes clear that he has used their anxieties to again advance himself and the urban rich class to which he final and overarching is for the world win means uncertainty about future strategy in a world that has long relied on the united states for stability but capacity to is almost limitless his environmental and trade policies all have the

race and sex stoke deep responses in the years ago the great oral historian studs recounted a story told to him by a woman been molested by a relative as a child tried to tell her mother but no one would believe her yet one day when she was shopping with her mother and they spotted a black man far away on the other side of the department store the women gathered the girl close to worrying aloud about the unbridled lust that that man might toward little white girls the woman told even as a young she could see the craziness in that they could not see or hear that she was being assaulted by a member of the but instead their anxiety against the distant figure of a black man obliviously going about his have been thinking about that story quite a bit in recent as pondered the phenomenon of peculiar appeal to any but especially a particular stratum of conservative women particularly intrigued by women who worry aloud about his extreme or misogyny or careless grasp of foreign affairs yet who then say that what really drives their allegiance is of the supposedly murderous and licentious this is often expressed as a repulsion so strong like the little mother and they are willing to give uncle a pass in the face of multiple allegations of sexual breathtaking unprecedented verbal incoherence and the intensity of vitriol directed at still mystifies me to a great story reminds me that there is an affective dynamic to all an emotional narrative that may make sense in an alternate universe from which i may be functionally excluded race and sex stoke deep autonomic responses in the psyche trump began his political career more than 20 years ago by taking out a ad in the new calling for the execution of five teenagers wrongly accused of raping and beating a young white stockbroker

have plenty to fear read throughout the trump has evoked old tropes of a ravaged endlessly at risk from thugs and terrorists with endorsements from the likes of the and trump has a narrative of warrior masculinity that dates back to film birth of a nation the trope of pugilistic white vigilantes fighting against lying and libertine black invaders black voters in that in order to protect the of frightened white women it seems not insignificant that trump has consistently appeared with a backdrop of attentive beautiful women who smile and wave and whom he symbolically shelters from rapists and terrorists and the bad from many of us nasty women of a certain age and is not sheltered by such cowboy chivalry in her achievements as secretary of state were slandered or obliterated in ways

marine pen welcomes a where we are we have been here before not elitist to fight back against a tidal wave of dark and dangerous passions that need resisting at every turn from now hill disappointed but i will keep up the the 2016 campaign is over half of has elected a new president while the other half looks on with dismay this was no ordinary campaign i had hoped that the country could confront the hatred that many of its citizens seemingly feel for black undocumented migrants and women i had hoped that an eminently qualified white woman would escape the protracted vitriol that confronted our first sitting black president perhaps race would protect her from the insults she in large because of her gender i was fought a good and for this she should be commended she shows us how to and come back to fight again another day she navigated the blatant misogyny that both her campaign and rallies by many of the voters who put her opponent into office few of us have courage and fortitude yet given the lasting damage that might be done by this we may need it trump is moving to the white and liberals put him there frank read riddance to this nasty campaign obviously deeply disappointed that but losing is not new to me many of us understand that bringing about social change is a lifelong struggle because there is no resting place for those of us who want to make only the recognition of the dignity of i have to get up every day and find ways to work for the that our children and grandchildren deserve i have to be prepared for whatever comes my and that includes defeat this is not a new lesson for and based on the tenacious nature of an all too familiar lesson for wish she had won always easier to move forward with the wind at your back than it is to advance into a strong especially one that seemingly hates your guts once again facing the sobering reality that the battle for fairness and decency starts anew each day but i also know that this is one election along the difficult path of protecting and deepening democracy commitments to civility and fairness are hallmarks of strong democracies and in my we have made progress i am committed to the promise of and now that this nasty campaign is i will continue to fight for my democracy simply too much at stake not victory is the last gasp of a desperate white morning i interviewed who was born before women had the right to vote in the us had the chance to vote for a woman who looked likely to become left that interview exhilarated about how much rights had progressed in lifetime exhilaration was in the air in new the ultimate glass ceiling was about to be shattered there was an intoxicating sense that women could achieve anything we wanted now that the future was than 24 hours later voted an unqualified misogynist who has spoken about women by the into the white house women can do anything we want it unless we aim too can run for president but be indulged in the not actively supported we can rack up decades of experience and have it in seconds we can speak up about sexual assault and then see our alleged assailant elected into the highest office in the besets us but the us must live up to its role in the world read win has trained a spotlight on the extent of the misogyny that runs through it also reveals just how far rights have how much has been how threatened the denizens of a fading feel victory is the last gasp of a desperate white patriarchy may have lost the election but that mean women lost on morning our fight but we also need to be careful not to frame victory as a case of men versus women exit polls show that the majority of white women voted for trump it seems that upholding white privilege is a bigger priority for many women in than protecting legislation that gives them control over their own if win has taught us one thing that we need to stop talking about we need to stop pretending that women in are a homogeneous group with the same privileges and priorities feminism is meaningless unless we talk about feminism women of who should feel the angriest today women of who have been most let down and women of who have the most to every freedom that women have fought for is now under do we tell our daughters about the the big girls who sat up waiting to see the sexist get his or the little ones who we told would see the first female president of do we tell them this role is still beyond the reach of any that no woman can meet the standards that are required of qualified woman with flaws has lost to a man whose tax avoidance and sexual assault allegations are not flaws enough to bar him from the nor indeed massive support was a prose not enough poetry trump even do just won now we organize to block every step of the way read through the night i heard say people respond negatively to women seeking power they hold them to higher standards trump dispensed with standards altogether women function to service as possessions their bodies are not autonomous he needs no consent to grope them this is what your daughters will see now that a man with the lowest possible opinion of women has been elected to the highest office this is what your sons will you are a powerful man in you can treat women like refuse them the right to make decisions on reproductive basically consider lives lesser than yours the patriarchy is fully restored and some women helped restore some women voted for possibly two thirds of white women for the misogyny around came from all the fans who would not vote for the many men of the left who said there was little difference between and trump because rights are low down in their list of priorities male privilege spoke on the left and the silver charts show that if only women would have won easily the rage of men is so they will unite around this inadequate narcissist to move back out of the dark ages we are going to need girls and boys to go back to to break up this band of old rich white men who have battered the soul of however heartbroken women it is they who now have to pick up the pieces it is they who have to fight for themselves because every freedom they have fought for is now under

a month ago i tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to pull it off there is a darkness about trump that negates that sort of a folly so an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever in saying so i am not referring to his business practices or his vulgar remarks about women i mean this in a purely technical this man fractured his own party his convention was a fiasco he had no ground game to speak of the list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short he needlessly offended countless groups of disabled mothers of crying the bush and among others he even lost for now he is going to be president of the united states the woman we were constantly assured was the candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time everyone who was anyone rallied around and it make any difference the man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the oval whence he will hand down his verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old there is a bright side to a trump victory after there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him he has pledged to the of and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task he has promised to renegotiate and maybe will finally come to pass maybe win so much for us he once predicted in a campaign that get sick of not deceive ourselves we going to win anything what happened on is a both for liberalism and for the world as president trump goes about settling scores with his former picking fights with other and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne what we need to focus on now is the obvious what the hell went what species of guided our democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our at the top she has an impressive she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine twitter victory speech in was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a victory would have moved every democrat in up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary something that was taken for granted had winning been the number one several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was with his powerful plainspoken and there was an inspiring and largely figure each of them would probably have beaten but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party so democratic leaders made their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the her fondness for and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose even though they knew about her private email server they chose her even though some of those who studied the foundation suspected it was a sketchy try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a monster is to court disbelief if trump is a as liberals often democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop not a party hack chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats mean what they said about that their opportunism took precedence over the or maybe supporters among the media help either it always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the but it was the quality of the enthusiasm that really harmed her with the same arguments repeated over and two or three times a with nuance and contrary views all the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a cold war propaganda station what it consisted was virtually without flaws she was a peerless leader clad in saintly a a caring benefactor of women and a warrior for social scandals real the economy was doing well was already people supporting if they it was only because they were botched humans racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the republican candidate how did the crusade the fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus they chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them they transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting what could possibly have gone wrong with such an put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery of 2016 the class just spent the year rallying around a professional really all that and either insulting or silencing everyone who accept their assessment and then they lost maybe time to consider whether something about shrill shouted from a position of high social that turns people even larger problem is that there is a kind of chronic complacency that has been rotting liberalism for a hubris that tells democrats they need do nothing they need deliver nothing really to anyone except their friends on the jet and those nice people at the rest of us are treated as though we have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these democrats are the thing between us and the end of the world it is a liberalism of the it has failed the middle and now it has failed on its own terms of enough with these comfortable democrats and their cozy system enough with and its

predictions about the future tend to run to the extremes some people think that artificial intelligence will liberate us from leaving us to a life of and kettles others think robots will steal our ushering in levels of unemployment like all the reality is likely to be something in between also likely to be strangely tends not to wipe away the differences and inequalities in a society for was famously wrong in his prediction that the introduction of railways would overcome the caste system in technology is mediated through society it builds on the inequalities we already twisting and transforming them role in society has changed drastically in the last century but men and women still lead unequal economic lives women tend to work in different in different in different and for different incomes that economic difference means that technology will affect women in ways that are sometimes sometimes but definitely different from the effects on some as many as of jobs in today will be done by algorithms or machines within a decade or two not the case that jobs will stay and will go the key question is whether a tasks are routine or not reviewing thousands of documents to prepare for a court probably best done by a machine talking someone through a difficult health probably still a job for a person it 's up to people to ensure the new economy serves the greater good read workforce is highly women tend to be concentrated in particular industries or occupations this mean women will either bear the brunt or be exempt from job losses the breadth of change promised by automation means that both genders face job losses over the coming decades some roles such as administrative staff or personal secretary may but then so too may heavily male roles such as machinery operator and some kinds of what we can is that on current trends automation is likely to embed the inequality that comes from having a workforce gender pay gap in may of this year is a little over by the way is basically the same that it was back in may we know that a large part of this gap comes from female professions being paid less than male equivalents automation change that in this human skills such as or even complicated manual manipulation have special value but the risks and opportunities in the new economy may well be distributed between men and women in gendered patterns we are likely to see growing demand for people in the care sector these such as nurses or aged care are now largely performed by women and are largely underpaid at the same time we will also likely see growth in roles in science and technology areas where women are traditionally underrepresented technology going to erase that gap if current trends continue we have a pipeline of young women ready and able to take advantage of stem opportunities we can hope that automation may force us to rethink the value of caring roles and pay our nurses and childcare workers more to achieve that we just need to advance our tech we need to advance our not just about how we work as machines take over a greater share of profits will flow to those who own things rather than those who do things take for example at the moment the value produced by is split between the company that owns the and the drivers who do the work if cars take the value created goes in its entirety those who own the vehicles men are positioned to capture a greater share of those profits because men own more than women as a consequence of the gender pay men have more more investments and more superannuation feminism has the importance of economic independence for women and in the postwar period women have entered the workforce in ever greater numbers to achieve this in a will this continue to be a viable strategy for economic are very real questions about what our relationships and families will look like if we cement the role of men and women as economic unequals we have had decades of slow and progress towards more equal and respectful home lives can we expect that to continue if the opportunities for women outside the home are and less well why teaching graduates to be flexible is more important than worrying about jobs that do n't yet exist read the other side of the there is little evidence that the explosion of household technology does much to change the burden or division of household just as one task is made easier by a another new expectation or demand seems to emerge so what are we to first we need to abandon hopes that inequality will melt in the face of scientific advances this is true not just of but of or any other driver of inequality we will erase inequality in the future in the same way we did in the past through the hard work of concerted action to remove structural barriers for this means continuing with the program we already have valuing removing the barriers to women fully participating in and ensuring government levers such as superannuation and taxation reduce rather than intensify the wealth gap it also means that government needs to consider the ways in which new threats and opportunities impact men and women differently we need to be alive to the role of gender not a task for the future a task that starts now take the gig for example has made it easier and cheaper to find people to do tasks what we do with that tech is up to us some companies have used it to develop business models in which workers are paid have few workplace and no guaranteed hours worth noting that women are concentrated in the jobs which are particularly vulnerable to this business we have to accept this there are other ways to deploy this same technology we can encourage models that leave all the risk and uncertainty with the worker when i say i mean our but i also mean each of us as citizens and consumers we can all question the ways in which people seek to use technology and ask whether they are making us a more or less fair society after technology make

borrowing costs next in this outcome the combination of a healthier economy and reduced policy uncertainty should allow the fed to recommence interest rates at its though the pace of rate increases

leaders are planning a meeting in to discuss without the prime the guardian has the president of the wants the 27 remaining member states to discuss around the time of an summit scheduled for 15 16 according to two prime minister would attend the but would not be invited to separate the third time the has been excluded from talks since it joined the bloc in 1973 leaders met without soon after

on the will spend four to eight weeks drawing up detailed guidelines for a list of red lines that could cover everything from the single market to the status of work started but tusk wants to start preparing the ground one senior diplomat told the guardian the guidelines would be a trade off between speed and the guidelines remain flexible they are easier to if they are very they are likely to take more diplomats are keenly following fallout in the some say they have been shocked by the media response to the high court decision on role and the limited of judges the welsh law officer has strongly the attacks on the high court and explained why he wants to be able to make representations at the supreme court member counsel general for said the had been deliberately misrepresented by some he there are those who have deliberately chosen to misrepresent the facts to challenge the independence of the one of the cornerstones of our democratic parliamentary system the reporting of this judgment in some newspapers was frankly a disgrace and an insult to the good name of democratic structure of the and indeed this assembly is built on a foundation of the rule of law and the independence of our judicial system the tragic recent history of is littered with examples of countries that overthrew the rule of law and undermined the independence of the courts that road is not a democratic one and leads only in one direction i would hope those who may have made comments and statements in will want to to the assembly in why he wants to appear in person at the supreme court i consider that this case raises issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of parliamentary sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the united kingdom and the legal framework for think it is of paramount importance to at this point that despite the political furore surrounding it and the frankly alarming tone of much of the press as the high court itself this case involves a pure question of law it is not concerned with the merits and demerits of leaving the union and the politics surrounding sole legal question at issue is whether the government can as a matter of constitutional law use the prerogative powers to give notice of withdrawal from the union in seeking to intervene in any the welsh government will seek to reinforce the importance of parliamentary sovereignty and the rule of established principles of constitutional that the welsh government was not seeking to reverse the result of the referendum he having outlined what the case is about i should also make a comment on what it is not about the first minister has made crystal clear and i repeat that sentiment the welsh government respects the result of the referendum and this is absolutely not about overturning that decision the legal commentator has posted a good story on his page he says that the lord chancellor and justice is being sued by six high court judges for age discrimination two of the judges are also claiming sexual discrimination and racial discrimination is an extract from post all the claims relate to reduced benefits the judges can expect to receive under a new judicial pension scheme introduced last hearing has been arranged before a tribunal judge who is not affected by the new pension arrangements there could be further hearings before appeal thought to be unprecedented for serving judges to sue the lord chancellor and the ministry of justice turning back to the ifs report this is interesting a table showing how many of the fiscal targets set by the treasury since 1997 have been met success and failure of treasury fiscal targets since 1997 ifs counts 12 targets in and concludes that only two of them have been hit both were rolling targets that did not involve balancing the budget in a given but setting plans that involved balancing the current budget over a and then later a timetable that may sound like but the ifs commends this approach only two targets managed to be met that is the coalition initial target to aim for a balance on the current budget five years out and its subsequent revised target to aim to achieve this three years out it is perhaps not a coincidence that these two targets also had much to commend them in contrast the other targets either had more thresholds that were more arbitrary did the cycle start and of should debt definitely fall between two future points in should welfare spending definitely be below some fixed were not sufficiently flexible in the face of adverse fiscal shocks must there be an overall surplus in must borrowing in be no more than half what it was in the weaknesses of these other targets often meant that their abandonment was preferable than trying slavishly to adhere to them here are some more pictures from tour today may stands amidst priests after offering prayers to the deity lord during a visit to temple in images may

impartiality lies at the very heart of good journalism avoiding bias is something on which respectable media outlets pride themselves this is as robust debate is vital for a healthy media by an informed society but when the weight of scientific evidence points incontrovertibly one doggedly reporting both equally can result in misleading provided a example of this in coming in for harsh criticism in a trust report which singled out their attention to marginal on the subject of man made climate among other issues despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that human activity is driving climate the report found that several shows fell victim to an application of editorial guidelines on resulting in far too much airtime for climate change deniers a report published in 2014 concluded that this key conclusion resonates this known as false arises when journalists present opposing as being more equal than the evidence allows but when the evidence for a position is virtually it is profoundly mistaken to treat a conflicting view as equal and opposite by default with respect to man made climate the is far from the only outlet skewing their coverage in the name of and global coverage on climate science remains exceptionally with the scientific consensus part of the problem is that good science reporting requires a keen understanding of scientific method and the importance of evidence in the absence of dubious views can perpetuate in held a press claiming a link between autism and the vaccine these allegations received scant attention from dedicated science who were familiar with tropes and acutely aware of the paucity of evidence for claims activists instead targeted their stories at selling them as human interest pieces this strategy was devastatingly effective as author and academic a staggering of science stories in 2002 were with over of these pieces penned by journalists in we were getting comment and advice on complex matters of immunology and epidemiology from people who would more usually have been telling us about a funny thing that happened with the pair on the way to a dinner and writers who lacked knowledge of the requisite science fell into a default assumption that two mutually opposed views must have equal merit but the lack of evidence for such ominous claims was still rather and investigative journalist deer began to work eventually exposed financial conflicts of interest and unethical and in time claims were exposed as a wealth of data has continued to show the vaccine to be completely consequences of the needless were anything but faced with conflicting reports and unable to their respective parents opted to not vaccine their with deadly results and an resurgence of measles of this is intended to pin the blame for these deleterious consequences on journalists and media outlets but the fact that activists could exploit the ideal of impartiality is a worrying one the assumption that good journalism requires mutually opposed views to be treated as equally valid simply hold when the overwhelming weight of evidence points resolutely in one does however require a certain amount of expertise to and for media outlets discerning between valid science and pseudoscience can be a difficult task journalists are under tremendous pressure to produce engaging with tight deadlines one way of reducing false balance and poor reportage is to put scientific experts in direct contact with those covering the and such as the science media and sense about science have had considerable success in such i strongly recommend that scientists register their expertise with these groups to help stem the tide of misinformation scientific public engagement is but the question of when and how to engage is rife with complications i encountered this when an radio station asked me to discuss the documentary with its star the aforementioned the producer claimed a rival broadcaster had offered him a slot with a sympathetic host and no and that there was strong local public pressure for him to appear i grudgingly agreed to provide a with the caveat that i would be allowed articulate why giving him a platform to air discredited views was itself unethical the experience was a frustrating predictably generating more heat than is the crux of the issue with false balance no matter how noble the intention of media presenting science and pseudoscience in an adversarial format gives a false impression that an issue is scientifically contentious worse it gives free rein for dubious motivations to masquerade as scientific opinion whether the issue is or anything presenting an belief as being on equal footing with an established scientific understanding is corrosive to public understanding i asked author and broadcaster for his take on this unfortunate and in his view such media requests are as as they are situation is but i am increasingly declining interviews because it is not my job to provide false balance and thereby justify bad journalism most recently a local radio station wanted to have a jolly chat about cupping in light of its use by athletes i because the piece was inevitably going to be says it is cupping therapists says it works for some patient says it worked for hosts says that opinion is but it and a series of callers ring in with their tales of cupping miracles i want to be part of that sort of be this it is entirely possible for media outlets to cover publicly contentious topics in an informative and responsible manner the has quite admirably now given its reporters training on how to avoid false balance and present complex and contentious pointing out that science coverage does not simply lie in reflecting a wide range of views but depends on the varying degree of prominence such views should be of the disconnect is that there can be a wide gulf between the scientific consensus and public with broadcasters resorting to false balance to appease their audience but rather than default to adversarial media outlets might benefit from framing such issues in context as a discussion as an example of i was recently a radio guest with discussing the controversy over the vaccine rather than enforce a contrived debate and her producers explained to listeners why it they were opting to avoid false whilst still tackling fears the result of this in my an informative that explored misconceptions whilst putting them firmly in scientific context when the science is relatively this kind of approach is orders of magnitude better than conjuring up a pointless as it gives an audience an understanding of the evidence base these views are built upon with such an it is possible to cover dissenting views and to explore why these are not scientifically accepted this is far more constructive and understandable than the default paradigm of two talking heads shouting one another down media outlets have an important role to play in conveying vital information and pushing a standard for and quality control that may be lacking in more fragmented modern media but engaging in false balance undermines this strength and risks giving debunked or dangerous fringe views an air of legitimacy and the oxygen of publicity and such sophism leaves us all more divided and less informed on on via on on on on on this content
the 2016 presidential election has been an exhausting and bruising spectacle now imagine living through it all as a this election has managed to cram all the sentiments of the last 15 years into the span of 15 and then morph them into one ugly trump is largely to blame he called for total and complete shutdown of entering the country until it became clear that the proposal was embarrassingly only to be replaced by the equally vague he fought publicly with the gold star khan suggesting khan was not to at the democratic convention because of her faith he accused as a group of harboring terrorists but we all know the story by woman was set on fire in new now just going out requires courage read has insulted and defamed many different groups along the but what we may not realize is how different when it comes to over the course of the trump has very publicly reached out to and voters to ask for their support we can question his but the gestures are there he even briefly tempered his tone regarding during a quickly arranged visit to president in city last august his daughter and wife have defended him for his unforgivable behavior toward and also recorded an official campaign television advertisement openly courting women voters for her father trump denies the charge he mocked a disabled and despite a bevy of antisemitic incidents involving trump and his supporters over the past he has also directly sought support such is his style of he may insult but he still wants your vote not so with the a tiny handful of be trump but that diminish the fact while attempting to engage every other campaign has made essentially zero public outreach to the electorate as if citizens already exist in irony is that willful blindness to voters may lead to his defeat may only account for a small part of the but a concerted push by during this season has meant that there are now over a million registered more than double the number in 2012 and tend to live in key battleground states such as and but may not be able to count on all of those votes either many have long been uncomfortable with her hawkish foreign policy record and her superficially inclusive rhetoric need to be part of our eyes and ears on our is a standard and with it we hear the suggestion that our communities live on some kind of of warfare this is so not the front line of maybe most are folk also seems to see as separate from her idea of need to be part of and to believe that as a carry some insider knowledge about evildoers that we may or may be willing to trade in exchange for equal treatment in the united states this is offensive to our and must be afforded the same rights and protections as everyone else without precondition but what this campaign has really shown is how contested and precarious the place is for today that change after 8 regardless of who wins even with a trump and his which is how he refers to his will not simply vanish and the suggestion that trump is merely using the election as a platform from which to start a new media empire is hardly as if there has never been a connection between mass media and politics so how prepared are as a to deal with after we learned all the wrong lessons from read any good news to come out of this that the country now recognizes the potent political force that is and are beginning to understand that fighting bigotry is not fundamentally about protecting but about preserving the vision of a pluralistic and democratic society now we must be prepared to do the work necessary to hold our leaders to that standard every and not just once every four elections on on via on on on on on this content

to become the 45th president of the united or trump has to win 270 electoral college votes the candidates have spent what feels like 100 years locked in mortal but in the next few hours there will finally be a victor probably if a or a mandatory prepare for constitutional remind me how the electoral college works each state is assigned a certain number of electoral ultimately based on its population has the with 55 seven states north south and have just three electoral votes gets three there are 50 states in the most of these are republican or democrat they vote the same way every time going back at least six elections so the presidential election boils down to just a handful of the 10 or 11 states that have a recent history of selecting both republicans and democrats this is why voters in places such as north and new are subjected to a barrage of television advertising and campaign stops also why you have not seen and trump holding rallies in or twitter how does the us electoral college faces a much more difficult path to victory he needs to win almost all of these swing states to become the next whereas if wins two or she wins the race this is because democrats start from a stronger position there are 18 states plus that have voted for a democrat for president in every election since 1992 that batch amounts to 242 electoral votes there are only 13 states that have voted for a republican in every election since 1992 those states carry just 102 electoral simply wins all the states that have voted for her predecessors in the recent then adds has 29 electoral she is the next president if she loses but and north she will be the next needs to hold on to all the historically republican win states such as and which are usually republican but where he has struggled in the polls and then win enough swing states to tip him over closing et in because now the real fun polls close in eastern and most of of each state are on central so the polls there close at running is the governor of in the past 50 years the state has voted democrat only once for in some states we will know the winner almost immediately after the polls close most news including the rely on the associated press to races is able to announce the winners so quickly because it deploys thousands of people on election night to collect results from counties and locales as they are announced it also uses exit polls and voting history solidly democratic or republican states are likely to be called quickly swing states are likely to take trump drink but trump have to worry about the prospect of a trump presidency a nice way to toast and if you were minded to do so the builder might be to mix up a cocktail as you settle in for the night got cinnamon schnapps and orange juice but the most fun bit is the cotton candy on top it look just like his twitter the cocktail it could be a long or a short one but at this stage we likely do not yet so our advice is to fuel yourself for a not a sprint and you can feed yourself and prominent role in us elections by preparing a chili a more take on your traditional brought to by in the if drinking more than one of you will want to line your rolling you always get what you want a perfect to election given that both candidates are incredibly unpopular with the public trump likes the rolling stones and played this song at his rallies the rolling stones do not like and asked him to stop he et ends in three key swing and new a minimal number of polling stations may stay open until 29 electoral college votes have proved crucial in the recent past gore can tell you that he narrowly lost the state some still believe he actually won and the election to w despite winning the national popular vote away from the top of the senator and republican presidential candidate is up for he has been running a bit ahead of democrat in the polls who resigned as chair of the democratic national committee in after leaked emails showed the party favoring is expected to comfortably win to was a reliably republican state until won there in 2008 and again in 2012 the mix of rural wealthy federal government employees and military

perfect as the race is to heat et close in west north and expect the result from west very quickly trump should win easily north and are swing states and will take longer has been seen as a reliable bellwether voting for the presidential winner in every election since 1964 that run might be coming to an either because of the changing demographics or because of the strangeness of the current in terms of the of both candidates while its demographics are complicated a mix of rust big farmland and more the electorate has grown more white and less educated than the national mean that trend appears to account in part for strength in the buckeye state this the message of love because is was born in you could also make a point about spreading a message of love or of someone pretending to

swing states are called we could find out the result before et if trump proves the polls the race could as quickly run to there are some individual states to look out is one some polling experts believe that if trump win it is effectively game over gave him less than a chance of winning the presidency if he fails to take the buckeye if trump loses north or or it also becomes very difficult

used the attack and its aftermath to cover up a surge of and blindings in one of the conflicts in the world this is the story of the bloody summer that have endured and of why they will not forget 8 a militant rebel was shot dead by armed forces and police in a remote village the killing sparked a series of spontaneous demonstrations and in a matter of turned into a reinvigorated popular revolt against dominion over this disputed path to militancy began in another one of bloody summers back in when security forces killed 120 protesters who was then 15 years is said to have joined a small group of homegrown militants after he and his brother were humiliated and abused by soldiers over the next few he became most famous militant and acquired something of a cult following among young who saw him as a symbol of resistance against occupation was a new breed of unlike the first generation of separatist fighters in the early he did not cross over into he use a and he amassed a huge following on social where he issued brazen challenges to the state it was therefore no surprise that thousands attended funeral in his hometown of or that those who could not get there their own funeral services across the took to the police and paramilitaries were deployed in large numbers across the region thousands of young protesters charged at the armed forces with stones and slogans demanding freedom forces responded with lethal firing cs and metal pellets into the crowds in less than four nearly 50 people were killed and thousands injured more people took to the streets to protest against these and the forces and police killed and injured more of them a cycle of protests connected to the funerals of those protesters in fired resulting in yet more killings and blindings

on the use of the pellet guns a spokesperson for the representing the described its position to the disapprove of it but we will have to persist with this necessary evil till we find a there is no recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and willfully shooting at people to blind the statement appeared as a typical the sort of thing that officials must compose and recite with studied ambiguity for the press the as its known but i was struck by its cavalier of state violence and it was obvious that this was not the personal it was a clear articulation of the intent of the state in was an unprecedented expression of state violence there is no other recorded instance of a modern democracy systematically and shooting at people to blind them at the end of according to data

woefully wrong one hoped but the numbers kept piling eye after mutilated eye popping up on the screens of phones and as journalists began to publish their none of the powerful men who run from expressed qualms about the blinding of it became clear that in its hubris the state had decided that snatching vision from a few hundred young people was a fair price to pay for keeping in check perhaps itself blinded by a strain of arrogance peculiar to occupying it continued to pummel a subject population into phrase used in mystic poetry to denote the passion of the translates as the of

nationalist any sense of the basic rights of a suffering population has been eroded or vanished entirely the hostility now appears to be and for those on the receiving unbearable powerful studios urge the state to be more aggressively while actively suppressing or distorting news from one prominent newspaper ran an poll about the continued use of the pellets that had wounded and blinded so many a clear majority voted in support eminent columnists speak calmly of the need for toward civilian protesters to the ruthless response and the twitter account for a government digital posted a poem calling for the army to murder until they images from began to circulate on the despite frequent attempts to block including at least one midnight raid on the offices of a local and a blanket ban on

admitted to the main hospital in medics and parents were desperate to save vision in at least one eye for those who had been attempting to extract the jagged and irregular pellets only happens in a a surgeon sent from later said twitter a protester who was shot by security forces in in 2016 protocol for the use of these crowd control weapons is to aim at the legs to disperse demonstrators but it seems that the paramilitaries and the police have been deliberately firing into faces some may only have minor some will suffer limited loss of some will lose one some and some will be impaired for but the pitiless assault on protesting adolescents forces us to ask one is the state happy to blind a is inconceivable that policy mandarins in or their advisers in could be unaware of the destructive power of earlier this the international network of civil liberties and physicians for human rights published a report titled in it an indiscriminate spray of ammunition that spreads widely and cannot be aimed not only likely to be lethal at close but are likely to be inaccurate and indiscriminate at longer even those recommended by manufacturers for countries have banned police from using ammunition meant for hunting animals the spray of pellets was designed to catch prey in flight but many countries have continued to use them as a means of force to control civilian security forces often deploy lethal and ammunition against and weapons have blinded at least five young in the last two years the use of rubber bullets by police was banned in the region of in after at least seven people were blinded by them on the streets of months after the uprising in square that toppled an a young police became infamous for firing pellets into the eyes of protesters against military government his exemplary skill at blinding civilians earned him the nickname the and his notoriety as a symbol of ongoing state brutality eventually led to a jail prosecute its own eye or outlaw the use of these the present every kind of other is a suspicious a scapegoat for any failure that befalls the politicians determined to make great the secessionist the impure the traitorous the woman who speaks her the the dissenting writer any voices who might call for a ban on these guns are certain to be ignored to the ministers and and their demagogues and have continued to advocate the use of both pellets and bullets against protesting crowds in unruly cattle must be reined in at any have become accustomed to the violence inflicted on them as they are to the indifference of the world when pellets were first sprayed at protesters in the heated summer of most people processed this as nothing more than a new just another element of the war in if one were to draw a diagram of the assaults inflicted on bodies over the hardly a single part would remain in the when the violence was at its the eyes were now they seem to have become a target the victims of such consciously and cultivate reserves of tolerance for but also a capacity to too i grew up amid the darkness of the late and early i remember that most of us teenagers innately understood that being or beaten with batons and rifle butts by an trooper was a bit of a joke when compared to the horrors that others endured in the dungeons of of the most notorious torture papa ii a building on the banks of lake in was refurbished and and served as the stately residence of the late politician mufti his as the current chief now presides over the of another generation of remember that the war in those years taught us to treat corpses and shrouds as reminders of passing which was measured for the young in massacres and assassinations i the tragic rupture in the body politic when an atmosphere of fear and loathing forced out the a minority that had cohabited with for centuries in an almost overnight many of them targeted and killed by separatist militants who runs an for the welfare of the past 20 we estimate that 650 were killed in the i know what happened to and my childhood mates from the primary school we all attended near an idyllic river bend in in south i experienced a bleak as response to the uprising included the grotesque policy of and under which combatants and alike were dispatched in summary executions or tortured to death and i remember such a vengeful assault on ordinary people as we are seeing now buoyed by a belligerent nationalist at the helm in the security forces on the ground perhaps feel emboldened to unleash a more widespread an affecting photo essay by journalist in the new times documented a few of the stories of those who had been blinded by pellets it remains a grim testament to the darkness in even though the blindings at that amid hundreds did not attract too much notice at the hardly any civil society group or human rights thought fit to speak up about such a wicked crime the wanton of the a project that some media in take particular pleasure was perhaps fully even then it certainly is when fed on a daily diet of nationalist take to social media to celebrate the and blinding of young the government in a collection of local elites comprising career and loyal to considers pellet guns a might make us feel grateful at least they acknowledge the part perhaps to address their own guilty few days into this the a local reported that the local government had deployed a fleet of brand new ambulances to securely ferry visiting to picnic spots in the valley this was while protesters were being maimed and blinded and while the ambulances carrying them to hospitals were coming under fire from security forces twitter victims of police shooting who have been blinded in one or both eyes in hospital in ophthalmologist at the main hospital in told the express in the first time the foreign bodies are irregular which causes more damage once it strikes the sharp i had assumed that the pellets fired at protesters like rubber or plastic were round things it turns out that there exist different kinds of and in some forces are using the jagged variety which inflict greater damage to flesh and eyes and which doctors say is far more difficult to did get how is it all right for a constitutionally democratic and modern nation to blind scores of civilians in a region it not an authoritarian not a crackpot not a rogue nation or warlord outside of legal and ethical commitments to international but a democratic a member of the comity of nations how are thinkers and its thundering televised custodians of public and private all untroubled by the sight of a child whose heart has been penetrated by metal this is the kind of cruelty we expect from not the largest such an inhuman response to an uprising to mass dissent has been the province of empires and tyrants a modern democratic nation rarely unleashes such except upon victims whom it does not regard as its own people it is quite clear that for and its have been subjects and not citizens for as long as have refused rule you do not shower projectiles that target eyes and viscera on a people you consider your own in snatching away the vision of the state has decisively announced that it has only one a hubris derived from its might and military dominion over the state convinces itself that it has the power to inflict blindness in no it blinds itself too to the character of democracy that is its central founding principle the harsh repression of the economist sen declared in is biggest blot on is hard not to see this mood of brutality at the very least in its to the larger register of extreme by both state and that has come to be over the last couple of has been some dissent in even some have written elegiac columns and essays on the savage response to the rebellion in they have implored their government to cease the to be and to talk to but it appears that the clouded by a newfound chauvinism and a hunger for is in no mood to listen to the voices of sanity in only a few days after forces in murdered a watchman by firing 300 pellets into his body from close the prime minister used a speech on to taunt over its own atrocities against separatists in the province of where the army has inflicted forced disappearances and summary executions on the people forgets that it bombs its own citizens using fighter he said but chose to forget that his own forces by killed scores of young need to interrogate the circumstances that have led to the deliberate blinding of hundreds of young people at the hands of armed forces in before this too is forgotten as some of the wounded have begun to some accounts have suggested that the damage may have been less severe than initially feared that perhaps many of those who underwent eye surgery will regain in at least one eye this might make one feel better relieved that its not worse but there is something wrong with that kind of moral akin to the security officials who continue to maintain that pellet guns must be used because the alternative would be worse one security official told an news website that pellet guns had actually is unfortunate that there have been eye injuries but the pellets are less lethal than getting hit by we might what if the armed forces stationed in had fired live bullets but this in the security forces have already killed nearly 100 civilians is that an acceptable a year or as and continue to harp on their there will arrive a season of surface calm a to in people will marry off their and celebrate an they will also welcome tourists in their blighted when this new

there has arguably not been a us presidential election with so much at stake for the rest of the world since the second world war one candidate stands largely for she would do slightly more than her predecessor to shore up the existing liberal world order her opponent is vowing to turn that order on its jettisoning alliances and free trade while seeking to cut deals with the authoritarian trump is elected on it is likely to trigger a foreign policy crisis inside as the diplomatic and security establishments scramble to discover whether he meant what he said on the campaign trail those who believe that the election talk was all bluster and that trump will tack back to a more traditional republican foreign policy once elected are likely to be according to an analyst at the institution in us trump and in tight race on campaign 's final day live read more view is he is a more ideological candidate than we often appreciate and while there is a lot of bluster and a lot of ignorance on a wide number of there are certain things that he has been pretty consistent wright said think he is opposed to us alliances and i think he would try to withdraw the us from security commitments around the world he is and he would veer towards a more and he is he is some believe that trump would be confronted with a series of resignations by diplomats and generals if he tried to turn these campaign platforms into administration policy on the other wins the electoral college she will face the opposite how to distinguish her foreign policy from she has expressed an inclination toward a tougher stance in and in for but the for a change of policy has shrunk with every passing week as has sought to create new facts on the ground in the last stages of the era more weeks would go by while a new administration dives into an inevitable policy review events around the globe may not wait that long whoever sits down at the desk in the oval office on 20 next year may be forced to take some of the toughest decisions any us president has much sooner than he or she would faces host of global threats during transition until next president read power and influence is being challenged around the world at an accelerating and nowhere more so than on the peninsula the north has sped up tests of nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them expert opinion varies on whether his technicians have succeeded in making a nuclear warhead small enough to put atop a and there is a general consensus that if they have not done so they will soon it is also widely anticipated that in the next few north will perfect an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the us west coast former and current us administrations have taken the strategic decision that should be prevented from reaching that by force if necessary but the ultimate decision will most likely be taken by the next foreign policy advisers have that she would focus on the looming crisis early in her term in reassuring japan and south that the us will not abandon and seeking to put pressure on china to enforce trade sanctions more effectively that may well not leaving a administration with the choice of agreeing to a resumption of with and accepting its nuclear weapons as long as it restricts missile development if that were it would alarm us allies who are already within north missile allies are likely to reach that point of alarm far more quickly if trump reaches the oval office he has questioned the value of us alliances in the and he has floated the possibility that countries like japan or south should develop their own nuclear weapons rather than rely on the us strategic umbrella if he sticks to that policy in there could be a sudden nuclear arms race in and possibly beyond a trump administration would have to face the direct threat of a north missile he has said he would put more pressure on china to get tough with its and he has said he is willing to meet in the on the grounds a or a chance that i can talk him out of those damn he has he is quite willing to contemplate using the us nuclear arsenal if the weapons cannot be he why are we making why do we make china china tantalized by us election mayhem and prospect of trump as president read his or her first year in a new us president would also face a direct challenge to us power in the western pacific the of laying claim to reefs and rocks in the south china sea and turning them into naval and air bases gives potential control over some the busiest shipping lanes in the world us influence is under further threat by the rise of in the who has threatened to eject us casting doubt on his agreement to allow new permanent presence likely policy will be to continue faltering to and to restoring the faith of us allies in the region that will help them resist attempts to dominate the south china sea it is a policy that is held hostage to some extent by ultimate and it could lead to a rapid escalation of tension in the region trump has pointed to the as a reflection of us weakness but has not said what he would do about it he has focused more on the threat posed to the us by its trade relations with china in the transactional model of foreign relations trump he could agree to turn a blind eye to creeping takeover in the south china sea in exchange for a bilateral trade deal with on better terms why plans for zones in could provoke conflict read new us president will arrive in office at a time of significant military advances against state in and but diminishing options when it comes to helping shape the opposition battle against the regime and its and backers it is possible that the rebel stand in will have fallen by giving the regime the upper hand and postponing yet again any hopes of a political the presidential talked of establishing a or a inside it is hard to see how that would be done without risking a direct clash with with all the risks that entails the generals at the who have long argued against the feasibility of establishing such a would work hard to block such a scheme a white house is also likely to explore ways of increasing the flow of arms to moderate opposition has indicated that he would seek to work with and in a combined fight against and has not voiced criticism of the bombardment of areas such as eastern that policy would also have heavy costs the opposition and the gulf states would see it as a and the new administration would have to deal with the reality that neither the regime nor has much immediate interest in fighting and administration is expected to take a tougher line with than the white all the more so because of the substantial evidence of the efforts to try to intervene in the us presidential election in her could well seek to take a leadership role in negotiations with over and the stalled peace which have hitherto been left to and she could also opt to send lethal aid to as a way of increasing us the world views the us from to north read is likely to take the opposite approach he avoided criticism of for its actions in hinted he might accept the annexation of and ignored us intelligence findings that was behind the hacking of democratic email a trump administration is unlikely to contest enforcement of its influence in eastern and aides have consistently that one of her priorities would be to show us willingness to shore up and and will attend summits of both in has by that is obsolete and questioned whether its security commitments in are worth what the us is currently spending on them he said he would check whether us allies their obligation to before coming to their calling into question the purpose of the pact later in the he changed saying he would seek to strengthen the but a win for trump on would nonetheless deepen anxiety in eastern such as the that a would come to their in the face of encroachment two major free trade projects of the the transatlantic trade and investment partnership with and the partnership with the countries on the pacific will probably still be under negotiation when the new president comes into giving him or her the option of killing or completing first supported the and then it in the face of the primary challenge from sanders her reservations may prolong the but she is ultimately expected to pursue and seek completion of the ambitious multilateral trade

unfairly with ignoring the threat of retaliation climate has promised to withdraw the us from the climate which comes into force on and to all payments of us tax dollars to global warming the republican presidential nominee has said a believer in climate describing it as a and has castigated efforts to reduce greenhouse gases as a risk to prospect of trump in the oval office poses a unique

agreement is in any signatory nation faces a delay before it could opt with a further wait as the process plays said an expert at environmental law at would be impossible for a president trump to remove the united states during what would be his first the uncertainty would spook countries that rushed to embrace the deal after the us and the two greenhouse gas jointly announced they were

being dangled money is a huge money is we have been enslaved by money now they want to control us completely in this new world order scenario the say no enough is enough we are turning back to caring for each other and for the planet the are getting more people are waking and it is really important at this point in human history that we stand up to the tyranny of the corrupt governments that back the corporations that are destroying the planet i have always spoken to the police and had interesting discussions with them many protesters feel negative stories about violence are by the and i would tend to agree with that the police are there to do their which pay their rent and mortgages they are just like and many feel sympathy with the cause hopefully one day soon they will take off their helmets and join us i have been to all but one of these protests it is great to be with other people who feel as passionately about corruption and want to see big changes always interesting meeting lovely having fun but also feeling that we need to be doing this a drop in the ocean but this movement is not going to go away if we can get more people to wake up to what is going then have always believed in standing up to oppression and tyranny it is our duty to do so we have been fed so many lies and the media is mostly propaganda to maintain people as units of production and consumption v for vendetta provides the image of the guy but it feels as though our future could be like that if they think they can get away with it 1984 warned us about it but with the brave new world aspects of therapist and mother twitter several supporters argued they should be free to pass on public roads after police imposed restrictions on the including a protest limit aspect of our society makes me feel ashamed of the human the and watching the older generation even my parents be tricked into voting for ridiculous convinced that these people will improve the country sick of racism towards people who are simply moving from one place to often to escape that our leaders have and will forever as long as there is money to be made from arms and oil the ignorance of a large portion of a because of a corrupt media and unelected bunch of you think the civil rights movements in the us in the and were they want us to not just because of the potential violence but to block our freedoms and rights the police try this every and with about of the people there acting in a violent they feel justified last no one in the main march had any idea of this police car being blown up the march went nowhere near yard funny that there was a whole group of news reporters stood conveniently near the vehicle when it yet i probably saw about one reporter near the march for the whole evening something fishy was going on there exhilarating until you see someone throw a firework at a police horse but that was just one clearly an and he deserved to be arrested spoken to a number of police each year and some have expressed sympathy as many have had their own pensions and benefits cut the majority of them are arrogant and see themselves as better they view us as a bunch of though we are also protesting for their sake offered officers mini cheddars because they looked hungry most have turned up their noses at them but the odd one or two were really grateful i also witnessed many people being arrested for not moving behind a certain line the police had made up the officers were trying to scare everyone off by pretending to arrest this guy but all they got was abuse from the twitter protesters wore guy masks in reference to the film v for vendetta are being manipulated into believing austerity is in our best annoyed at the current status quo of our elected representatives riding roughshod over the needs of the people who pay their taxes and keep the wheels turning decisions are made by faceless individuals in and elsewhere we are being deceived and manipulated into believing austerity is in our best interest yet public services are being decimated these protests represent a group of individuals coming together to demonstrate their frustration and unhappiness at a system that is rigged in of an elite of unelected cabals who have undue influence over the lives of working people with an undercurrent of violence aimed at the property of big companies and police dressed in riot try to attend as much as i can i protested outside parliament on the eve of the bombing it change a thing i went along to the demo last year that was fun change a thing either i used to go to the may day protests but now as they inevitably end up in a kettle but they change a thing i went to the war demo i remember seeing people on the streets of on the boards at circus and cracked they have to listen to as we now they i believe protesting can change much in but the point is that that we still have to we still have to demonstrate our displeasure at things we agree with or they whoever they are will continue

2012 about one every two days per which is hardly twitter the extreme strangeness of the regime in it is easy to presume that they would not know how to talk to a sophisticated southern audience in fact their as revealed in the is rather clever instead of hammering people with outlandish and unconvincing propaganda in the usual north trolls focus on areas that are still debated in the south such as whether to give southerners access to sites that praise the northern regime aware that recently started accounts with little background often arouse northern agents also tend to work behind identities stolen from real southern the problem has been serious enough for south to and indeed to overreact for years the national intelligence service has been routinely posting messages of its own to attack those coming from the and at times these have allegedly strayed into attacks on south own opposition parties last year the former intelligence chief won was convicted of trying to influence

united states and women who talked too much and started fights were recommended punishments included making them wear gags or repeatedly dunking them in water to simulate we literally outlaw the act of women becoming successful or famous but we still punish the women who do by turning their very visibility against and making their time in the public eye a reputation destroying misery the more

in a landmark legal decision last the high court upheld a legal challenge brought against the government by miller and and ruled the government cannot use the royal prerogative to trigger article 50 of the and so formally commence the process to leave the without parliamentary judgment means that the process must be subject to parliamentary control and oversight importantly in the light of some recent media the court stressed that this is purely a question of law and that the court is not concerned and does not express any view the merits of leaving the that is a political the case arose because article 50 allows the to withdraw from the accordance with its own constitutional but there was disagreement as to what the constitution actually government argued that it could use royal prerogative powers that residue of monarchical authority now exercised by to the withdrawal while it is clear that prerogative powers cover international relations and the conclusion of it is settled constitutional law that an act of parliament in this case the communities act 1972 cannot be supplanted by the exercise of a prerogative court accepted the arguments once notice is given under article some rights under law incorporated into domestic law by the would inevitably be lost on completion of the article 50 process the government cannot give notice under article 50 without reference to parliament this judgment can be seen as a victory for parliament during the voters were constantly urged to back and regain parliamentary sovereignty from the in what sense is parliament taking back if the government is using its ancient prerogative to manage the whole withdrawal process without any significant parliamentary that would be extremely undemocratic and democracy is what we are told the referendum was about every national has been endowed with rights under law some of these will vanish on triggering article the judgment makes clear that the exclusion of parliament in the process is not only it is illegal there is a wealth of case law supporting the some of it dating back to the 17th century and the civil wars those and the ejection of two kings during that established that parliament is sovereign and that the executive cannot ignore where it has no legal authority to do judgment makes clear that the government does not have any such legal authority in the context of triggering article 50 it must be stressed that the judgment also makes clear the importance of rights in the process much of the judgment concerns legal arguments over the which can seem arcane yet they are of vital importance to every has been described as a legal and it is in many important aspects different from ordinary international law one such aspect has been the extent to which it confers rights on individuals through the every national has been endowed with rights under law rights of free movement and residence in other but also many other types of such as employment consumer or rights to information some of these will vanish as a result of triggering article 50 and the withdrawal government has said it will transfer some law into law through a repeal and then decide in future whether or not to retain it judgment makes clear that decisions that inevitably remove rights may not be taken by the executive alone parliament must be are the practical consequences of this a government spokesperson has said the government will in which case it will be and heard very quickly by the supreme court the government might try to change its and argue that a notification under article 50 could be revoked this would be the opposite of its high court concession that triggering article 50 would inevitably result in the withdrawal of the from the so lead to loss of individual at present both government and claimants are treating the triggering of article 50 as the inevitable point when it becomes clear that the will be if it were acknowledged that such a move is the point would be in triggering article 50 by executive the government would not be subverting statute at that it would not be rendering the a dead inevitably leading to a loss of truss defends judiciary after

one of the curiosities of the long rise of is that the party that wraps itself in the union and invokes a version of seems to have such a limited understanding of and its institutions a ruling last week by three judges that parliament is sovereign and must and the triggering of article 50 to begin the process of the leaving the union should have been a cause for celebration the judges listened to legal arguments citing explained very clearly and carefully why parliament is sovereign in these matters and must pass an act to begin was furious at this supposed incursion he said that he had a

opinion having had such an enormous influence on shaping recent perhaps the trainee demagogue has started to fall for his own is plotting to overturn the result of the referendum and betray the nation there are certainly a few people trying mistakenly and pointlessly to reverse but they are not running the government and do not have the numbers in the house of commons or the country will as sensible acknowledge the question is in what form that is deeply because it creates the false impression that will be blocked from leaving the locked in by dark betrayal narrative has echoes of 1918

the of the infamous politician who the anger of it is not just that has lost touch with the constitutional fundamentals other parts of the broad movement some and the press have also reacted as if the article 50 decision constitutes a judicial coup against the vote a constitutional crisis is with parliament supposedly pitched against the people some of the more vocal in the parliamentary party have indulged this illustrating what happens when campaigners become too hooked on runaway populism fresh from undermining the governor of the bank of they are now on to the judiciary is there any part of the which theoretically they are dedicated to they attack in lurid is even the queen needs to calm down the anger against the judges would be justified if they had declared the referendum invalid and banned they did no such thing they simply confirmed that parliament should have its proper place in the process of course it is not even as if the judges in this case have been particularly which has been a problem in recent with some judges pushing the interpretation of the law in a direction in tune with their thinking or trends in law here in the article 50 case they took a thoroughly traditional and praiseworthy they were branded which is unintentionally revealing the charge that judges being unelected equates to illegitimacy is yet more crazy populist talk we do not elect judges and for good reason centuries of constitutional development and experimentation produced a compromised and weakened by in which the judiciary is independent parliament makes the laws and the courts interpret the law and make judgments of we could try electing or ordering judges to disregard and ignore the rule of law on the order of but the international historical precedents do not suggest it ever ends someone who voted to leave the i simply cannot see the problem with the courts and parliament doing their respective jobs properly nothing could be more in tune with the vote to leave the union than three judges applying the law and declaring that parliament must give the for article 50 twitter said he had a that is it is important to understand the limits of what the court decided and what parliament can reasonably do next it is not a mandate to stop the leaving the those who think it is are the mirror image of the those equally who refuse to accept that they lost the referendum

way of saying stupid but neither set of extremists is representative nor has a majority parliament or the country what becomes ever more apparent over is that there is a need for an alliance between moderate which there are leavers and moderate those who regret the result on 23 but accept it if a deal can be done after two years of talks with the it will involve a degree of which again is supposed to be a there is no bespoke deal to be because the it will be time the chances of the former rather than the latter outcome being the result are greatly enhanced by moderate leavers and if

increasing numbers of people have been warming to the notion that may not have to mean after all this was probably inevitable given that those who voted for it did so for a very wide range of and it is abundantly clear that the cabinet is about as unclear as the rest of us the announcement that the government has lost its high court case about article 50 3 means subject to it will have to be debated in parliament this presents a golden opportunity for to throw a spanner in the works by refusing to vote for article 50 to be triggered without knowing or at what will actually look like when we know the awful truth i predict a stampede towards arguments about this thwarting the will of the people needs to be shown up for the nonsense it is it would not be thwarting the will of the who voted against i a high proportion of those who voted to leave vote for hard having believed some of the lies of leading perhaps we can still pull back from the brink if parliament is prepared to face the fury of and the two groups that are increasingly difficult to tell the high court decision is not about whether we stay in or leave the it is about common sense i have always been a reluctant not against as i simply believe that the decision was reached in a fatally flawed partly because the leave campaign never had to explain exactly what leave would mean people were being asked to vote for a blind turn back time and redo the but at least if there is a full debate in parliament we will get a proper discussion on the reasons for leaving and the options for the future it is highly likely that parliament will vote to but at least the decision will have been reached in something close to a proper process this could make a big difference in healing the fractured and politically intolerant mood that has emerged in the country since the claims that the high court ruling is an attempt to scupper altogether are ridiculous in addition to committing the cardinal sin of defining a word using the word itself means the government has also made no sense when arguing against parliamentary ratification of article may has rather that any negotiator knows you should not show your hand to those on the other side of the table before negotiations have even begun she is it is not implicit that anyone but parliament is able to see our negotiating hand parliament is able to sit in meaning only may be present and no media coverage may take place this was done in 2001 when debated the crime and security involvement in will not reverse the referendum it will simply the terms of withdrawal and it can be achieved without showing our hand to the means is a meaningless and unhelpful phrase and high court judgment reminds us of this two one designed to make us forget the constitutional framework and legal process consultative means for by a narrow we should leave the without further parliamentary scrutiny or consideration of the implications or constitutional foundations of the despite being is based in law parliament the decided to ask the public their opinion and parliament should decide what to do with this the house of lords must be given the chance to do its job too if it exists at all surely it is for moments like to intervene and apply perspective in a situation when the government of the day is trying to do something deeply unconstitutional and to ensure that the proper time and consideration is given to a decision with such significant result of the referendum is causing divisions not just because of how deeply many people feel about the issues or that the result feels but because the referendum itself was not put in a robust constitutional and as a result its consequences are open to fox and seem to understand the high ruling the nub of the matter is that the executive cannot by royal prerogative alter the rights that citizens currently enjoy as members of the the most important of these is the right to live and work freely in 28

that must vote on article 50 is simply an example of the drama we should get used as leaves the obviously i am not qualified to comment on the court judgment or the prospects but it is an example of

the remain majority in the commons makes it those who should be cheering high court judgment the loudest are the people who have been the most passionate defenders of parliamentary sovereignty so the judges have heeded your earnest plea to make parliament supreme put out the your insistence that be the ultimate arbiter of our national affairs has been given the judicial seal of approval let all those who spent the spring trumpeting the glory of hailing it as the mother of now celebrate their of they those who campaigned for leave in the name of wresting power from to went strangely quiet when it came to the question decided by the court who has the power to trigger article suddenly they found that parliament was not quite so sacred or central that some things were best left to ministers to decide the judges have called out that hypocrisy they have decided that the should have to comply with their own logic and bow to that as has said he that a is imminent that parliament might opt for a as the former leader put or even that it might halt you can see why a the remain camp still has a majority in the when you add up not just the and the liberal democrats but also the estimated 185 who wanted to stay in the if they all united and voted as they did on 23 they could block do that too many would regard it as a constitutional to go against the verdict delivered in the referendum others have a more practical fear of contradicting the wishes of their own local anxious they would pay the price with their own are the judges who ruled that should vote on read that fear will only fully kick in if may presents them with a a motion to trigger article 50 or not if the choice is any less stark than if may proposes detailed legislation then that would give plenty of wriggle room they could say that while the public voted to they did not vote for this of leave that would give the remain majority in parliament the chance to slow things down and demand a much softer other factors could prove decisive the coherence of in parliament now matters if the party can get its act together and unite the demand that remains a member of the single market then it will have real muscle the early signs were not recall that the first public figure to demand the immediate triggering of article 50 was hours after the vote but and others have set a good needs to press the case against hard strongly and other thing to remember is that parliament is not just the commons the lords will have a say too unelected peers thwarting the will of the people may look like a democratic outrage but and the rest can hardly complain the lords are an ancient part of our parliament and parliament as they never stopped reminding us is say if attempt to overturn public trust will fall even those of us who voted leave in order to ensure that our who make political decisions in this this ruling in the high court is a nice irony i personally have a problem with anyone using any democratic or legal means to achieve any political end they want and no doubt that have the right to cancel if they choose to do i would advise them to use their power respectfully and wisely the reputation of the political classes in this country is already very and any attempt to overturn the referendum result is likely to send it down even further with baleful make any difference in the long run is a moot point there are powerful vested interests in the already at work to get the ballot overturned or render it meaningless there are equally powerful interests in the itself who are willing to help them out i bet against them succeeding as the and have referendums in the are flexible friends but that will leave a pertinent question do votes actually count for anything in these or are they merely glorified opinion the public must get a say on the final the conservative commitment to the principles of parliamentary representative it is disappointing that decision had to be made in the court a failure to consult elected representatives of the public on the terms of the negotiation package would undermine the very principles that and fox have championed this will provide some clarity on what has been a completely chaotic showing from the government so will be vital that parliament now works productively together to get the best possible negotiating deal to take to given the strict timetable of exiting the once article 50 is it is critical that the government now lays out its negotiations to before such a vote is held so team have been all over the place when it comes to what is best for and time they pull their socks up and start taking this the people voted for a departure but not for a which is why what really matters is allowing them to vote again on the final giving them the chance to say no to an irresponsible hard that risks our economy and our the appeal is unlikely to succeed twitter prime minister may government has announced that it will appeal against a judgment by a court that restores sovereignty to the parliament to legislate for the legal landscape even for the sake of that just looks bad the vote leave camp campaigned for sovereignty to be restored to the parliament it is symptomatic of their many inconsistencies that they now argue that this crucial decision ought not to be taken by has caused havoc already now parliament must save us read three days of legal the writing was on the wall for the government when it was forced to make the significant concession that article 50 is both unconditional and irrevocable that might be true but it is at least open to challenge legally the irony of the appeal is that it now opens up the box of whether the article 50 question on can be answered only by the court of justice if what sort of delay will that my the government has poor prospects of succeeding in the supreme court the high key reasoning is that the government without the intervention of parliament confer rights on individuals or deprive individuals of there is no answer to this the removal of the ability to seek authoritative rulings of the for is but one material change in our and it may have a profound impact on fundamental and social rights other major rights merely by the arguments i see a comeback to the various fatal gaps in the which the court found to be most fundamental rule of constitutional law is that parliament is and that legislation enacted by both houses of parliament is supreme if means the court has confirmed that only parliament can trigger it both houses of parliament now need to stand up for the national interest and demand accountability from the and for their constituents the courts have done their bit for the rule of law on behalf of all of now needs to do the this is what taking back control really ruling is a huge victory for our parliamentary democracy this is what real sovereignty looks and this is what taking back control really decision is about parliamentary sovereignty and our constitution it is not about leave or remain it is actually about whether we have a sovereign parliament in this and as such the decision is the right got a bill of rights in 1689 which gave parliament powers and took power away from the executive and the monarch those who wanted to leave the campaigned on the basis of parliamentary so it would have been completely inconceivable for the executive to overreach its prerogative powers and trigger article 50 without any form of parliamentary scrutiny or specifically legislated to hold an so it is now important that the government puts its plans before parliament so that can these plans before the decision on triggering article 50 and beginning the this ruling halt but further everyone high court ruling does not mean parliament will prevent they what is they why because they may not get a chance to the judgment is not the end of the there is an appeal to come but assume the supreme court upholds the verdict parliament then would have a right to vote on the triggering of article 50 will they use this opportunity to block the almost certainly the 650 479 are reckoned to have backed remain over half of conservative so there prior to the a parliamentary majority in of remaining but things have changed since 23 for one elected representatives were shown to be out of touch with their 421 of 574 and welsh parliamentary constituencies voted to leave polling that significantly more than of 2015 conservative voters and more than of voters backed leave voting against a referendum result generated by many of their own voters is not something many would willingly countenance court what does it all read most parliament seems likely to do is to impose procedural conditions on the prime minister these may include the need to report back regularly on the negotiations providing the kind of running commentary she has resisted to date yet even it is hard to see how can materially affect the final outcome article 50 lays down a deadline once a deal is they will face a choice between whatever may has achieved and no deal at all there will be no scope to modulate what is on the this is as it should be not as if politics was held in high regard before the referendum i shudder to think what would happen following a unique democratic moment that the population in a way even elections fail a parliament that had approved the legislation providing for the vote decided to overturn it because it had come up with the so to the final irony the chances are this ruling will not halt but further

it will certainly help to and focus the process if the high court rules tomorrow that not the has the authority to trigger the process as longtime critics of the system under which the royal prerogative is exercised by ministers alone rather than by ministers in this newspaper would welcome such a ruling in any truly modern the consent of parliament should be necessary in a major treaty which unquestionably just as it is now in practice since in any major military commitment yet although verdict will be constitutionally significant may well be appealed the reality is that to give greater authority to though is only truly meaningful if parliament wants to use it at the present that seems far from the has to change is the most important immediate problem facing the prosperity of the country depends on it the place of in the world hangs on it even the survival of the united kingdom as a functioning entity relies on it being sensibly handled our party politics are being reshaped by it will be the most consequential international arrangement made by this country in most of continues to act as spectators to the process not as participants in it again may was barely challenged on the subject at prime questions it is as though the referendum vote has become the totemic unchallengeable source of all political authority on future to which every other question must defer in all conceivable however dangerous this may be what the fanatics as they hound such as the bank of england mark and the but it is bad bad government and bad politics it needs to be resisted and for the government of called a conference of business leaders and civil society representatives in it was held to discuss the implications for delicate and for the future of the open border that and have broadly enjoyed in one form or another since as well as before independence itself the maintenance of that common travel arrangement is a policy that all citizens of the should be concerned about though opposed to the government has been exemplary in attempting to and codify the many complex issues that arise for the island as a result of the referendum vote yet the government has not produced for voters a tenth of the useful public material that its counterpart in has been was one thing for a new government to require a bit of time to sort out how to proceed on following the vote but that is four months ago now government and politics is increasingly living in a paradise about and its as well as about the timetable that will be triggered by a formal decision to start negotiations the scale of some of the reality was made clear in a new report on from a group of independent academics and political scientists its conclusion is that the with or without the parliamentary vote on the initial triggering of article 50 on which the high court will rule is as complex as it is unpredictable but the experts are clear that the process test the constitutional and legal frameworks and bureaucratic capacities to their is exactly the sort of sober and factual document that the government is derelict in its duty by not producing for the public it performs the practical educative service of spelling out many of the choices facing these range from when article 50 should be triggered late as in our whether it can be revoked how many negotiations are required hard to avoid whether there will need to be a transitional period the form of consent needed at the end of the process or maybe an in our and even the explosive issue of whether the referendum is binding practice but in law the fanatical press has a vested interest in not any of these and parliament have no such vested interest their job is hold the executive to account and to govern it is time they did this article was amended on 4 2016 an earlier version used the word where was on on via on on on on on this content
but it is not a given that the fed will hike in says economist at there is little in the statement to suggest that a hike is definitely going to happen currently pricing in a chance of a the statement comments that case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to while adding the word to the line that it wants to for some further evidence of continued progress towards its this all suggests that things are moving in the right but the presidential election is an obvious reason for markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity coupled with the reasonably firm rising employment and a gradual in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a rate hike should trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power it is hard to imagine the fed hiking in this environment we also have plenty more data to come ahead of the 14 including two more job reports so there are other reasons for fed statement has failed to give much support to the and us markets have struggled for direction after the news the industrial average is now down 33 compared to around 70 ahead of the statement the us dollar index has lost to 97 38 us chugging expectations only need a little more 2016 r la alarms and no surprises fed leaves rates unchanged but st hike in and dissent wanted hike a

central bank may get its wish the fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near it is expected to remain low in the near in part because of earlier declines in energy but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens now is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further the fed said in its committee expects with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial this the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at to percent the committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but for the time to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives the stance of monetary policy remains thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation this time there were only two fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not and who voted for a rise last has now sided with the majority breaking no great the federal reserve has opted to leave us interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before hiking any subtle change in language to hint towards hike look out for or 2016 the us federal interest rate decision will be released in less than an most commentators expect there to be no change not this close to the presidential election the prospect of a rate rise in is thought to be reasonably given the recent reassuring us economic is likely to be a focus as usual on the exact wording of the fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the comments at that meeting seven of the fed members voted for no with and backing an increase any variance here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in investors have been unnerved by suggestions that trump is gaining ground in the us presidential with one poll this week even showing him in the lead over combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in us crude this has pushed markets in sharply on wall street the industrial which lost 100 points or so on has

convinced by polls showing trump in the lead research director at city the markets are not in full on panic mode right suggesting that they still think could clinch a win next week this is reflected in the volatility which is considered a fear for wall street even though it has risen in recent days it is still below to put this in after the vote in volatility spiked above stock markets are generally lower on but us markets have outperformed their counterparts even with 6 days to go before the us election the transport considered a lead indicator for wall is higher today considering a trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the us the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the suggests that the us equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes or until the actual result is the other potentially market moving event is the us federal reserve interest rate announcement later brooks the market is expecting a chance of a hike tonight if the fed does that would throw the cat among the and we could see a steeper sell off in a rally in bond yields and a recovery in the in our view the bigger risk from meeting could be a dovish slant from the federal who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed although the fed is expected to be politically a potential market on the back of a win for trump next week could put the prospect of a rate hike to bed for the fed added to the fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent so a in the dollar

trump reportedly revealed last week that have three major voter suppression operations under intended to reduce votes for among white liberals and young though election day is still a week we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups because more than ballots have already been cast under the us early voting system approximately 125 million to 145 million are predicted to vote in the 2016 so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected turnout than at this time in the 15 states that provide detailed information about those north and nine other states report more early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election and showed a decline in early and those declines were signs of declining turnout from black voters and young early results offer mixed news for early votes suggest that young voters who are much more likely than older voters to lean democratic might be staying at home in 12 fewer aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012 this could be especially problematic for if this group is indicative of a broader or sentiment in which supporters of the former democratic candidate sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for voters the only demographic group that appears put off early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states especially in north a state that yields 15 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests is in a close contest if strategy is indeed to suppress the black that makes a lot of sense those voters could be crucial for to secure the white polls tighten but turnout is the real key to v trump read more speaking in trump predicted unprecedented constitutional if were to be

the emails currently roiling the us presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by from the hacked account of campaign chair john they are last scandal in a year running over with but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere they are a window into the soul of the democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party class to which i refer is not rising in angry they are by and large pretty pretty contented nobody takes road trips to exotic west to see what the members of this class looks like or how they on the they are the ones for whom such stories are written this bunch have to make do with a mountebank for a for this the choices are always pretty and this year they happen to be are the comfortable and mainstay of our modern democratic party they are also the grandees of our national the architects of our the designers of our the high officials of our banking the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or the middle east with precision droning they they not a class at all but rather the enlightened the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves twitter learned to fight dreamers campaign against us turn the magnifying glass on them for a by sorting through the hacked personal emails of john who has been a power broker for decades i admit that i feel uncomfortable digging through this stealing email is a after and it is outrageous that personal information has been since seem to have redacted the emails in any way there is also the issue of authenticity to contend we know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from john the supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their and though they seem to be there is a small possibility they all that taken into i think the releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the status hierarchy in all its righteousness and personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of financial innovators colleagues attempting to get jobs for their children foundation executives doing fine and noble things of and high academic industries loom large and virtuous here ingratiating speeches to wall street are well known of but what is remarkable is in the party of and and smiling financiers now seem to stand on every constantly proffering advice

nobody thinks trump will win the but we do tend to gloss over the fact that we still expect something like 50 million people to vote for him some of them are my i live in which will probably vote for trump if history is any indication its of 23 , 500 or has a per capita income of around and of my live below the poverty line one of those places where the coal dried up a few decades ago however depressing it better than it a trump good people in a feedback loop of paranoia and hate read house my children will grow up in was built in 1900 by their paternal belonged to the family ever each generation building on as needed from its original single room there are a few houses like that in the and we moved into this one mostly because we wanted our kids to grow up as he running barefoot through the woods and catching tadpoles in the stream behind the house is still an old place like that not uncommon for friends our age to live in houses recently made available by a family death we buy groceries from a general but miles to the nearest gas station or people here would vote for a villain if they ran on the republican ticket party affiliation is an inherited trait in many families some just like trump he what his supporters which baffles many given what the man but makes perfect sense if you that most of my pay nearly as much attention to politics as writing this and who are reading it many people are uncomfortable with a lot of the stuff heard about him but accept it as a necessary the main thing is to tell elites that not safe in their sinecures any that the common man is about to have his day all gone too far off the the county lies just over the river from west tried to come to but the council voted against it because they want to lose the small businesses lining the main street the company went to mason instead and pointedly positioned its store at the end of the intentionally quaint riverfront downtown now features a rundown some a liquor empty storefronts and a few improbably expensive shops all the tax revenue from the goes to talk about economic insecurity and usually imagining some angry white man upset that someone somewhere a and a woman to is getting more help than him but i picture that where it really matter what the people wanted they made their they got run over anyway a fair description of life in a place like this who admire trump for his business acumen are simply pointing out that no matter the ambiguity about his balance sheets this is a man who flies around on a which to someone making a few hundred dollars a week seems like unimaginable wealth our society values a human based on their material why then are we surprised when many people define and and is a test of fears to the population his slogan about making great again brings memories of last when the downtown bustled and anyone could make a solid assuming they too lazy to present themselves at the mine it ever an easy but it ever this hard difficult to given everything that has happened but trump exploded on to the stage with the first primary debate by telling us that the political system really is as rigged as that politics is about who you can buy and whose influence you can tap we have all known trump said it and where he built his been three years since i wrote a post about poverty trap that went viral and led to a book deal i now have the luxury of paying attention to the world around me but when i look at my hands i see the scars from knives and slicers and hot and i remember the rage that i could not name after a decade and a half of low wages and no because we all say that we live in a meritocracy and we all know but it keeps people sinking regardless it was bound to happen that a candidate running on fear would take us this far into the realm of the unfortunate fact of or at least the kind we practice in the western is that we below are turned against each other there is political value in racial strife as long as we can teach white people to hate nonwhite then we have to worry about poor people they outnumber the rich came to love trump because he speaks openly of the racial strife that politicians have been exploiting and stoking for decades to great electoral effect what people mean when they complain about political after all supposed to hate and fear a bunch of people but not talk about which is nonsensical except in the lens of where perception matters far more than substance twitter what a trump campaign rally reveals about can behave as badly as he wants no worse than people expect from the power elite as seen from is a place where bankers can unfairly foreclose on your house and then get paid by for doing it and then will demand you sign the bill his business shenanigans register as shocking because assumed that to get even close to that level already sold your just how it works none of the bankers went to and now the banks pay the equivalent of 37 years of the median wage in this county per speech to lecture for year 2016 will be political in the way you can say and people think of and bear and bailouts there will be and after this year is forcing us to grapple with a lot of realities been conscientiously avoiding trump will still walk away from this thing a winner by his lights if wins not leader of with a reputation left in pitiful dirty but as head demagogue have millions of adoring fans and a revenue stream he will avoid responsibility for what is to and rage and fear and hate are all closely unleashing them all in an unexamined pulsating mass of megalomania was at best we have already seen and we will see was bound to happen eventually that a candidate running on fear and division would take us this far into the realms of the unacceptable we stop it now the only thing we can do the thing we must if we are to save ourselves is begin to understand that if the system is broken for enough of us that we can together insist on changes that suit the instead of merely those candidates and donors who can afford to buy all the rivals they see on a primary people think trump will fix anything but a lot are willing to vote for him because whatever you think of

was unaccountably excluded from and to which i needed access in order to open a document that i had to rewrite having finally come up with the password complete with recent mutations of ampersands and exclamation marks and upper and lower case letters and barnacles of numeric additions phone gym locker once created on a cheerful whim and now at painful leisure i was faced with an unexpected conundrum six blurred photographs of street scenes flashed up on my screen along with this unwarranted of these images contains a virtual of a security guard clearly wanted to know who exactly it was dealing with to collect some more free data for its was i a robot mind intent on up barnacled or was i indeed a tired and impatient and forgetful human being very close to a in the i one or two goes at a graffiti might have but as machine intelligence has become a more nuanced capacity was apparently required to establish my human credentials we might not be good for much these days in but we can certainly a when we see peered at the photographs on the as if they were exhibits in a show some of them were straightforward but one or two undeniably gave me pause in the background of one picture in particular some warehouse type buildings clearly had glazing but no obvious what to surely the creators of this test expect this level of pictorial analysis or perhaps that was exactly what they if i looked really hard at a certain angle i thought i could make out some shadowy furniture in the window of the warehouse in question but still it looked more like some kind of storage facility than a conventional shop taking my life in my i plumped for the indicating and pressed enter another six images flashed no less complex in their composition than the first set and again the of these images contains a and so the morning ebbed even for the man who is credited with creating the name and the tool has become a couple of years i visited the headquarters of in alto and talked to then head of about his vision for the future of our interaction with our uncanny machines he suggested that the ultimate goal was really something like what you saw in the episodes he grew up watching in a village in he imagined a near future in which the interface between man and computer would be entirely intuitive and endgame of this is we want to make it always as natural a thought process as said are maniacally focusing on the user to reduce every possible friction point between their thoughts and the information they want to i thought of that conversation when i was at airport later that trying to summon a booking confirmation on my phone and faced with the need to first answer the following questions that might have been posed by my mate up the was your teacher at and was the first album you frictionless the first word that came to a recent survey of workers using it in their it was suggested that they spend about 36 minutes a day on a number that prompts the they must have got lucky over the past decade or two of our digital each of us has built up an average legacy of more than 100 sites and requiring passwords for access as the fraudsters and hackers have got more so the bar for entry has been set ever higher the recent added complication that on a change you cannot choose a password you have used in the past 12 months is another cruel blow to our garbled private mnemonics in the past of people admit to abandoning a login due to a forgotten password and about the same number suggested they had given up on paying for something they wanted to buy because of the complications of the authentication for the man who is credited with creating the name and the tool has become a curse that man is an emeritus professor of now aged 90 in the early was in charge of a massive prototype computer at the university called the computer was the pioneer of many of the features of digital technology we have come to love instant messaging and one that we do not because of the shared nature of it was decided that researchers should have their own accounts so that their work did not overlap a simple name and password code was devised to create a degree of gave an interview to the in which he acknowledged that he had inadvertently made a that password has not been monster become a kind of a nightmare with the world wide he said think anybody can possibly remember all the passwords that are issued or set up that leaves people with two choices either you maintain a crib a mild or you use some sort of program as a password did the have to i used to use a crib he said think guarding any great secrets three typed pages probably 150 passwords over the technology has long been showing its age despite the levels of complexity there are major password breaches reported weekly but it has proved hard to replace there are many companies competing to create a new form of universal open sesame that will make all those password reminders redundant and apple are inevitably leading this though many businesses are reluctant to hand over their authentication processes to the which gives an opportunity to innovative companies with a focus only on based in provides a platform that manages user identities globally for customers including retailers and the most of the login processes they manage are still but more and more use a form of we use your or details to find out who you and some use biometric facial and voice collects email addresses and some from read director of expects this latter category to grow exponentially in the next five years in its somewhat polemical report on the of the demise predicted more often than that of the suggested that than applications will be downloaded each year by as compared with in do all hope the password dies quite lack says the research supports the fact that most consumers hope that too would rather have biometric as we all now these days means that the people have spoken in unprecedented biometric means few banks are starting to use lack says and first direct are allowing touch id to log into your account and also some voice recognition but for the better part we are still using complex does the resistance think security is the drag lack suggests most of our customers there is usually a security team that is extremely anxious about adopting new technology the irony is as we passwords are far from secure now the average user has fewer than three passwords and those can very often be easily guessed they use them on average across 120 accounts if a password is guessed on then effectively a hacker can completely unlock your digital twitter every year millions of passwords are stolen or hacked couple of recent changes may accelerate the march of biometrics the new directive on payment services mandates that any payment will require authentication password plus though lobbyists for retailers are currently challenging that the other engine of change is the fact that two years ago the apple touch recognition interface was made available to anyone who wants to use it the first adopters have been banks because they have huge costs on call specifically for password resets is anyway far more secure than anything that has gone lack argues expect all banks to adopt biometrics in the next couple of other advance is in using network effects for identity management a pooling of your identity the horizon is the capacity that when security is breached in one place the network immediately knows about lack says like an immune response where one customer detects that i have had three failed password attempts it notifies everyone else in the cloud and says this user needs to step up authentication or have their account locked a massive benefit for security teams that will drag them toward security and biometric does sound like a major step forward for security if somewhat less so for users who will presumably suddenly be shut out from their although perhaps only until they have swiped a company has been working in this latter area for a decade and 30 , 000 websites and use its which is invisible to the customer its solutions challenge is that you really have a central store of biometric data because of the privacy implications it needs to remain anonymous in our the key additional security measure you need is what we call which secures all the weak points in this has built an network called the identity which already sits on websites and mobile and is enabled by cookies this network monitors every account transaction you anonymously know who you are but we various aspects of your and we correlate that moody kind of aspects of things for when i go about the i use several devices maybe a couple of two and i tend to use these machines to connect to the in different ways and from different locations i have a at i have sky broadband at home so over time i have a clear pattern of do i tend to have or is it turned the system looks at all that and correlates it with my different email addresses for work and the credit cards i have associated with those accounts and so on every time we see an we are this interaction look consistent with what we know of this do you usually log on to your bank account in this way from this if you you get a positive trust score if there will be an over your anonymous security profile will only get moody making it easier and easier to know for sure it is you doing what you are is the of a company called speaking on the phone from he inevitably asks i say you i reply has added an extra twist to these future scenarios it is belief that your phone will increasingly become your gateway to much of the if you have it on your person and you are logged that will be enough to enable forms of access without password issues twitter professor father of the of the companies we work with allows you to use your phone to open the electronic lock as you move inside the perimeter of the building they have you have to log in to as long as you have your phone with you it logs you in to the assembly line you have a strong authenticator the biometric is the phone itself if at any point the system suggests it

the latest furore over alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in 2009 2013 has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater with little more than a week to go before voting unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into conduct may not be politically but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly principally by the unscrupulous republican this new stoked by republicans and it remains likely that voters will deliver a possibly rejection of trump on 8 although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign is ahead almost everywhere that

24 my 11th dose of to be finding a bit more punishing than the seven cycles of chemotherapy just finished lost my more tired at the end of the and pain when i eat and drink around the main where my joins my stomach is definitely worse in fairness to the radiotherapy staff at the royal been brilliant they did say my symptoms would most likely get worse before they got better too details this is a big week for me and my cancer since the first line of chemotherapy which initially worked so reducing the cancer and the liver and lymph node metastases was shown to have failed the key question has been what to do next and aside from the radiotherapy aimed at controlling the main hopefully preventing it from further restricting the really about whether to start chemotherapy immediately or wait for some promising clinical trials due to open up in the next couple of a conundrum because the rules of eligibility for many clinical trials that any previous treatment must have ended some time before the trial starts for the i that if not careful the trial will inadvertently reflect the results of the previous treatment rather than the drug or drugs aimed at testing in the case of the trials that might be relevant to it is a requirement that any previous line of systematic chemotherapy treatment has failed and when you think about it from an ethical point of you can see why taking a patient off a treatment with a scientifically known set of costs and benefits before it has to put them on to a new unproven treatment no matter how promising would be questionable and these questions of eligibility potentially so critical to me because of the huge promise offered by some of the new treatments being trialled all boil down to timing so there you go cancer just like the rest of the question for me and my consultant now is whether my cancer especially the metastases in my liver are stable enough to allow us to wait for the trials to open or whether we need to get on with second line immediately unless it fails really quickly and hope that happen will probably rule out access to this next batch of trials which is why due for another ct scan this 25 back at the royal for the last of 12 daily sessions of radiotherapy thank but critically also to see my consultant the amazing starling about the results of ct scan and although the cancer spread anywhere and it looks as if the radiotherapy is working on the main i can tell you it most certainly feel like the news on my liver is not good the cancer is the says so we need to get on and treat it asap and that means a chemotherapy drug called delivered as an intravenous infusion every week for three weeks out of four and most likely no clinical trials at this stage of there are new ones coming up all the but whether be relevant to me and my and whether meet the eligibility are for now all as a fellow cancer nick has been a real source of support and invaluable the next twist in the story there is another drug called which has been shown to produce significantly better results when combined with in some patients as much as a 10 per cent improvement in response says starling but the rub has been fully clinically trialled and for use in the and beyond and is now almost part of standard treatment for my cancer but on account of the way they measure its cost nice do not recommend it in and so the does not fund what to money were no object or i was sitting here with private health insurance by the way i what would you i ask starling she says say take without hesitation which raised the question of what it would cost if i chose to pay for it from my savings as that would be the only way i could get it first estimate from the private patient when you include fees for the treatment to be given along with the cost of the was stand by per monthly cue very sharp intake of breath from yours 28 filming this morning for a special on cancer with my very good friend nick we first worked together on in the and then again 10 years later at when i was editor as a fellow cancer been a real source of support and invaluable and is one of the reasons i decided to go public with my diagnosis as he has done how much i and sensing how perplexing that can might explain the huge public reaction been to my interviews with on radio back to the cost of improving my chances with my due to start this coming on further investigation where would i be without it transpires that i need as much of the drug as the private patient unit and that the stark difference between what the drug company sells it for i should say that manufacturer were most helpful and the price proposed to me by the included a understand and accept that if i choose to add an element to my then i should pay for and that the should be insulated from any of the costs but a on the and over of fees for a procedure that take much more than two not things insurance companies or visiting multimillionaires might question but a very big issue for a potential individual like me to their the have taken my questions about costs in good and so let you know how we get the real paradox lucky in that i can probably afford this drug provided not for too long in other the sooner the treatment fails the happier my bank manager will then of course the facts are in the only so of people treated with even when you add will get any benefit at all from it and that is the eternal unknown an individual and so is my cancer part of but also with its own so which do i fit into will it work or no which i guess is what

here trump will make wealthy again we will make strong again we will make safe again and we will make great again god bless that trump closes out his rally have the highest murder in this country in 45 trump very is distorting an statistic into a false in the agency reported that murders and manslaughter rose in the us by in the largest increase since 1971 that is not the same as saying there are more murders in the us than at any point since 15 , 696 murders were reported in down from 1991 and 1993 highs of 24 , 703 and 24 , 526 there were more murders in 1971 than in murder rate declined from 1993 to even though the population increased by a this debate trump almost cited the statistic have an increase in murder within our the biggest in 45 the figure is a national not restricted to hear that from these he gesturing toward the press want to talk about can read our report on from the day of the release and before trump remarked on through the link up in biggest percentage increase

half of tax cuts would go to the top of according to the tax policy and most families below the top of earners would have income gains of less than trump linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of the his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in percent of children under the age of are in trump says citing outdated the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great but they have since to somewhere between 20 percent and 37 depending on which income threshold you use the rates for children are disproportionately so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on we rate the statement half two million have fallen into poverty under the he also the own fact use of is misleading on two he starts counting from when w bush was still in office and from right before the financial peak and he ignores that the population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost 1 4 million people fell below the poverty line between 2008 and census poverty numbers but the number of people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in 2015 it fell to down from in 2009 will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your he alluding to the on though the estate tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of

answer that can ever really for or anywhere else if is failing in its obligations to help refugees then it has a either to declare that it is not our problem and erect fences and police the or ensure and maintain safe through military action if within or close to the countries of origin that is where the failure of the or the united nations really the article by for children as camp demolition 26 explains that one cause for the delay has been that the children are being identified individually compare that with what happened in 1938 when the then home secretary sir following a house of commons agreed that travel documents would be issued to refugee children fleeing on the basis of group lists rather than individual became the amber home must operate the same scheme now and allow in all young people from no one should be surprised by hard line 28 on the or any other possible migrants to the it is consistent not only with her last conference speech as home secretary but with the whole of her tenure at the home in a that dates back to restrictions on migration in the and the insistence then that those who were allowed entry children and adults should not draw on the public as many have volunteered to welcome into their homes migrant children and families in flight from and then as now the home office throws up bureaucratic barriers through lack of financial prevents local authorities from stepping up at a time when services across the country are being starved of funds so the home office has jurisdiction to operate on good then grandiose talk of legacy of offering refuge is just grandiose talk empty of meaning and treaties and covenants signed but in practice not acted upon goodnight wherever you are so long as not i write in utter dismay at the situation now being reported from minors lured from 27 hundreds of children sleeping on the or in unheated warehouses or other inappropriate unregistered through no fault of their nowhere to go and now being is simply intolerable if we ever want to talk about values we must intervene immediately it is unacceptable to say that this is a problem we could take every single one of these children right now under the dubs and if the home secretary and a contingent of home office staff were to get on a train tomorrow and go they could make this events of the past few days constitute a dreadful stain on the reputation of this country and that of and will go down in history as evidence of our collective lack of humanity it is surely now a matter of criminal negligence despite all the detailed information and warnings over so many our home office has left taking any action until the absolute last and then failed so badly to ensure the most basic human rights of so many of these felicity my family and i fled my home nation of in 1999 due to the civil war my like many other sought a better life in for his family as a result of the oppression faced from regime he always said that if he had to choose between the wrath of and risk his life or negativity from a minority that want him in he would have always chosen the shown by hits back at abuse over criticism of refugee 19 about the treatment of refugees led to an outcry and negative responses including come here and take our and the classic come for our i wanted to share my story of coming to and of being here for reasons other than stealing your jobs or your was four when i came to first we settled in and eventually we moved to the as a child refugee life always easy as some may have you believe at school i struggled with the growing up in and facing racism we learned the language and adapted to become part of society my siblings and i all studied stem subjects at top universities across the currently a chemical engineering undergraduate at the university of are not a lone example of wanting to integrate into the society mo has won multiple awards in athletics for he came to the as a child from barely speaking a word of the late was the first women to win the architecture prize was born in and became a citizen of the the list goes on and on of those who came to and made a matter extremely thankful for what the has given me my family and i have had multiple chances to move abroad and make a lucrative living we never accepted those offers because is now our home the people who have welcomed and accepted us have been far greater in number than those who we want to be here and help pay back the debt that we feel we owe the and work towards making no matter how much negativity a minority give we forced out of our homes in we have moved i do want to make it clear that my like many come here to sponge off society we came here to be part of your society so thank for showing compassion for those who need it given how many parents lie about their religious beliefs or where they really live in order to get their children into their preferred school we like it but you have to do the best for your you would

presidents have declined to enact punitive measures on those countries secretaries of state can deny visas to countries that refuse to accepted convicted but this action is rarely used and when it is

read the omens are not good as dominates opinion polls and gets positive signs from early trump has stopped major donor events for the republican party he has reportedly cut back on transition plans and taken time off the campaign trail to open his new hotel in recently trump dolefully asked supporters whether they were glad he let you know on the evening of 8 whether the rally at a sports complex in his third in on drew an estimated 7 , 000 people but was far from in contrast to his swashbuckling early campaign it was overwhelmingly including many retirees but those who did attend waved and great signs and chanted her and the with the usual nodded approvingly when trump described his opponent as and jeered when trump reeled off a list of state department expenditures during tenure as including on to try to make state department pages more popular and to send three comedians to whooped with delight when the showman made reference to recent comment that he would like to take him behind the gym know what you do with you go like trump turned to one side and blew a puff of air from his mouth fall he dream about would that be easy that would be an easy the end of the two war veterans moved through the crowd with a giant pence sign a big trump said those are later one of tom a retired construction think trump will keep fighting i think a man who gives up none of us really believes in the polls because of the way the situation is with the media we know who to believe any view was shared by a consultant think any sign of him giving he said at all the people here i

she not going to burn down the white house because this is still my replied mean done echoed own view that the media and the polls are rigged against him and that size of the crowds he draws to rallies which he holds more frequently than demonstrates his grassroots support in may trump told the new of mouth is the no 1 thing and the word of mouth at my rallies is got to go see and you one person goes and they talk about it to 20 a us going to quit if you follow the numbers of people who come out to these you have to believe opportunity like you go to a football game and the crowd is so

never also launched a critique familiar to consumers of conservative media such as news and fox news polls are lying we all know rigged the real polls show him 10 or 15 points higher the only way she

i get it call to shorten our presidential cycle will resonate with just about everyone this year who counting down the days until this is even has been winding the months in crow points out in a petition on as of had more than 40 , 000 this extended political circus is a singularly phenomenon 2016 election will have lasted nearly 600 days by the time polls close on 8 by had its longest campaign season in recent history last and it lasted just 11 she writes across the globe have limited campaign seasons to as short as 6 weeks with an organized a professional campaign could be suggestion for how we reform our electoral process that we ask the and to reform the process is less compelling in a segment on morning on she threw out five days as the optimal amount of time she and previously floated the notion that all 50 states and the district of should hold their primaries on the same a move that would prove hugely advantageous to the richest candidates by grassroots opening clip for morning segment certainly felt ironic in former prime minister is seen ribbing president about the stupidly long length of elections always look on at the elections in awe of the scale of the process and the length of the says to in a news conference from of adding he marvels that anyone is left standing at the end of it joked back that term limits meant he too would get to sit back and in at the of might have wanted something different two months later be pushed from office over a voter referendum the result of which almost nobody saw moved on to how toxic media discourse has become petition is simply an appeal from a a single working mom who dives for the remote control before my kids can turn the on and see something going to have to the sentiment is but perhaps the problem is less the length of the cycle than the fact our republican nominee for president actively brags about women by the a fact worth come out until more than 500 days into the crow deems the of the election choosing to announce the beginning of his campaign is not something the or can actually control nor is the fact that campaign reporters often start sourcing up to cover the next campaign the moment the current one ends party committees do set the timetable for but even there they are in a constant with state which battle to move up in the primary calendar so their voters get more for entreaties to focus more on we may not have gotten as far into the weeds on the tax code or what we need to do to save the but we have furthered the national conversation around xenophobia sexual and those are things that should not be written off as empty identity politics since audio leaked of trump bragging about it on 7 a dozen different women have spoken about his alleged sexual not something i want kids watching either not something loved covering been emotionally and physically exhausting but more important that voters know who our next president actually is rather than collectively covering their all due i think crow understands the value of what journalists have done this cycle muting the television protect our kids from our reality and reducing the amount of time we have to learn about the people running for the most powerful job in the particularly when so much of what comes out of their mouths is make it harder to fool the it will make it infinitely elections on on via on on on on on this content

fight to goldsmith he we start here as second no two ways about a big mountain to but one determined to have a good crack at the ability for people of park to really change the way our country heads

local party liberal democrats leader speaks to the media on directly below the flight path jack the reason why the announcement was made this week is because we now have a conservative government without the liberal democrats stopping so the liberal democrats are the only people who have stopped the third runway so a confusing choice in some because who says opposed to is being supported by a party which is making the expansion happen to vote for goldsmith is basically to give to a government that is expanding are set to pour the park constituency in a bid to on their success in last the conservative majority in former prime minister old seat was slashed from 25 , 000 to 5 , 700 with a while the lib came second despite having finished a distant fourth in 2015 the lib held park until

campaigning for leave compass has joined and in calling for the party not to put forward a candidate to run against goldsmith in the forthcoming park soft left pressure group said in a the park is a huge progressive opportunity goldsmith ran a racially divisive campaign for the and was staunchly in of the leave side in this referendum his decision to trigger this latest contest in which he is the

result of the suggests they could win in park if other progressive parties agree not to run competing candidates that simply wastes votes and let the calls on the lib to select a runway candidate and

much closer to her own personal views because they reflect the fact that entire career before going into politics was at the bank of england and as a lobbyist for the financial service calculated

how is everyone ready for 8 i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of for women will depend on what happens in just 18 is no overstating how important this election is not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a and setting a very particular course for the women who live here look back on this time as a watershed a moment that in shape the next hundred years of first i want to share a personal story a little over six years i was pregnant with my and when i was 28 weeks i got incredibly ill i developed which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during was admitted to the hospital and within just a few i developed another complication called the short version being my liver was in danger of and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not had an emergency and was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was and she was and today a wonderful healthy and i feel grateful for that every share this story because this was something in my life that changed me that shaped who i am when i think about this what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my when i think about those days in the hospital the the the the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my most pivotal it horrifies one thing i want for the next hundred i want for no to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone want for no to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government the next hundred i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her why i want to talk about this election tonight because at before in politics have bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned and a candidate who promised to choice between a person who has spent her life in public and a businessman who rips off his perhaps most making a decision between a woman who has said that rights are human and a man who says if you want you can just grab women the a feminist rallying cry right now that i like a and it pussy grabs i know that so much has been made of that and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive those of us here in this room know know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this disrespect of bodily integrity and our bodies are our or make no the conversation that having right now about is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where will be and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human are the two optimistic that on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be exactly what would happen if abortion were made in what has already happened to women like who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to trump claimed that what he said on that access tape was just and later when former new city mayor said that all men talk like men across the country came out to is not normal this is not acceptable men are better than this the feminist future that fighting for has men fighting alongside of men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted when he called women when he called women the media who can so often get things wrong took him to our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked women have been disparaged and harassed for too many and not going to take one more minute of it course this feminist future the future that so close to getting not just being hinted at by the reaction and opposition to are getting a sense of what that future could look like when we see the incredible way feminists and women themselves have changed the for the first time a presidential candidate offered a nuanced and empathetic defense of abortions on a national debate stage this is a issue that most politicians but talked about lives and experiences in a way that reminded us that this issue just about policy about living in a moment when feminism is wielding more cultural power than it has in maybe ever people shy away from the word feminism any they embrace i started speaking on college campuses 10 years i would ask how many people in the room considered themselves feminists back just a few people would raise their hands when i speak at colleges nearly everyone has become so popular that the conservative right has tried to appropriate it calls herself a organizations call themselves the feminists they recognize the power that the word and the movement and they want to use it toward their very our feminist future is a smart and it knows that anyone who would legislate who would interfere in and private medical decisions have no place calling themselves being in this incredible feminist moment when the first female president is about to win by taking down a man who is as close to a caricature of misogyny as you can get being in this moment mean that our feminist future is not those of us who have been doing this work for years know that every time women make political and cultural there is an intense backlash in the midst of it and it will only intensify if becomes sure that this backlash define us that we are not put on the defensive by it that is what will truly determine our feminist future will we get pushed back on our heels or will we look straight ahead and move will we rest on our laurels because we have the first woman president or will we take our moment to celebrate and then move on to the hard work that still needs to be the people in this and the people at planned parenthood are any indication we know the answer to those is just the daughter tells me that she wants children one day she says she want to be pregnant her wife will have the but when she talks about having when i think about being a grandmother or a even one day when i think about those hundred years that been talking think about what the world will be like for them and i have i really that it will be a world that this will be a country where people determine their own world where we understand that reproductive rights are not just an issue of bodies but an economic a family and a human rights issue and the reason i have faith that future generations will see this vision of feminism and justice unfold is because of activists like you all here because of planned parenthood every day they are ensuring that the next hundred years will be years where bodies and experiences matter years where not defending ourselves from but building something progressive and something of you in this room are doing what is necessary to ensure that feminist future i could not be more grateful to and i could not be more honored to join that fight with on on via on on on on on this content
and you can read a full report from game 1 win world series game 1 against cubs as sets strikeout record read more email from this a good start remains to be seen if the goat fingers a seven game series and a lot can but no doubt this was a huge victory for the terry is now undefeated in world series games the more you a game 2 an hour earlier than game due to weather concerns a win there and the cubs have gone 1 1 on the which is what supposed to well then might start panicking be covering that for the hopefully be joining us thanks for following along with especially those who cubs 0 6 is in to here falls behind 2 0 it feels like with a 6 run lead the mission should just be throw but given the hard not to understand if his command gets the benefit of a high strike call on the next pitch 2 1 his next pitch is a definite strike 2 2 progressive field gets real loud and swings and misses at the next pitch and it gets the have won game 1 of the world series cubs 0 6 top takes ball one and then swings and misses at second pitch 1 1 he swings and foul tips one into the mitt for strike two 1 2 he swings and misses at a high fastball and out number two the cubs are down to their final out of the game cubs 0 6 top falls behind 3 1 and then hits a fly ball off the wall for a double improbable rally cubs 0 6 top closer comes in and immediately strikes out the are two outs away email from don stuck in without a functioning what to get on and find your coverage much like the early days of radio coverage when one had to wait while the announcer recreated the sounds of the bat and ball and the crowd for the kind be every game of the world series here at the hopefully stick with that goes for everybody reading right now hold we still have half an inning left here cubs 0 6 bottom grounds out and the inning finally ends cubs 0 6 bottom the one time i praise one of moves literally the only time this and it goes completely wrong hits a double off of ratings in start to plummet cubs 0 6 bottom hector is up here to face done no i just realized gets into a 1 2 then wastes a pitch and then throws a hanging breaking ball and hits his second home run of the cubs 0 3 bottom is up with one two out falls behind him 2 0 yeah this is the i remember he lines the next pitch over the guess we have a pitching although in this in the right to make a move here cubs 0 3 bottom guyer falls him 2 0 but guyer swings through the next two pitches to even the count guyer checks his swing and a full count now misses up high with his next pitch and guyer takes his base cubs 0 3 bottom hits a routine two down cubs 0 3 bottom is still out there imagine if the game were be someone else up also is to come up with another uh is ready to hit a soul never nobody on base to move any he strikes out badly on a unchecked swing on a 2 2 count not so getting a tad loopy here cubs 0 3 bottom the good news for is that probably not going to be available to for for more than an inning in game 2 not nothing it feels like might have leaned too heavily on his best but he knows the old that win game 1 of the world factoid cubs 0 3 top gets ahead 2 1 next swings for the fences and comes up empty 2 2 and on the very next strikes leaves the mound to a huge ovation cubs 0 3 top with a sharp is at third the tying run is up to the plate once again stopped you have to admire that cubs 0 3 top is up miller gets ahead of him 1 2 the crowd starts to get loud again every two strike count with miller is an event next pitch is a ball 2 2 fouls off the next pitch still 2 2 next a slider just off the gets called for a crowd like but it did break swings at the next pitch but he quite get a good swing at it and it ends up just being a that eventually tracks down thrown 38 pitches already cubs 0 3 top works a full count against getting him to throw as many pitches as possible might be the best strategy for the cubs at this he takes ball four cubs 0 3 top is back for his last inning one would assume is up in the bullpen he gets fowler to line out to is feeling good about a team called the winning in hopefully their own fans are even a little bit definitely a conversation to be had about the one that i imagine will only be amplified over the course of the serious it should be in my opinion cubs 0 3 bottom keeps in the game to face falls behind 2 0 before getting a strike call on a nifty 2 1 he throws another curve and gets to ground out cubs 0 3 bottom were the producer of there would have been 300 on that now we have who i remember as sucking pretty bad confirms my memory by hitting a rocketing double off of him cubs 0 3 bottom wood is in to face with one out and nobody on he induces a and once again what did i tell email from d after the top of the my feelings as a cub of well shit cubs 0 3 bottom the maddening has begun strop gets to pop out to second and brings out a new reliever going to somehow see the entire cubs bullpen over the next and is doing the catching now and is in right miller might be the only player who was both with the and the red that fans of both teams still like equally cubs 0 3 top is up with a chance for a storybook moment and he gets a 3 1 count with the bases loaded he takes the next pitch and a 3 2 count now this is the biggest pitch of the game right attempts to check his swing on strike three he two straight strikeouts from miller did i tell and the cubs load the bases with nobody out and push a run feels like the game please keep cubs 0 3 top strikes out on three pitches the cubs score on an out now cubs 0 3 top is for he flies out but not enough to score the runner from third one out miller is two strikeouts or one double play away of getting out of the jam first option is more likely with cubs 0 3 top is up next with two hitters on and nobody out he immediately falls behind 0 2 swings and fouls off the next pitch it really looks like lunging and think miller would be able to exploit that and put him away here rather lines a single and the bases are loaded and nobody out wow did this dynamic just change dramatically in the span of a few batters cubs 0 3 top who has been frighteningly throughout this is up to face what a welcome back to the major leagues this has to from to actually works a full count which should be as good as a solid base hit and in he takes a walk on ball four the tying run is now at the plate den s has immediately transported me into a brothers routine with this email and i honestly am completely down with what is difficult about saying strop is the first reliever to play in this world cubs 0 3 top from do you really think will play 3 times this try and do a and make a long relief if so do you think be as honestly part of the reason miller is warming up here is that would like to use on short rest for a potential game 4 but he is back to start the top of the 7th where he immediately allows to hit a a single and the end of night here comes miller cubs 0 3 bottom strop time in the ends up being the first reliever used in this world which is something not everybody can say going to be facing who he strikes say he did the job cubs 0 3 bottom flies out to left and that will do it for inning is taking him out into the everybody cubs 0 3 bottom guyer going to be bunting with a runner on second with nobody he might not get a he takes two there is stirring in the bullpen lester might not be long here it might depend on this throws a strike 2 1 guyer swings away at the next pitch 2 2 this has taken a turn think bunting now guyer takes a pitch on the corner for a strike cubs 0 3 bottom back up he been really just that first inning where he came close to unraveling why do i keep saying things like that hits a double off of him the second i finish that sentence years ago i beat i walked my 2 pugs while wearing a life comes at you 2016 cubs 0 3 top is to see if he can do anything on 1 1 he swings wildly at a pitch like not even sure it occupies the same dimension as he does on get the call pops up and it for this maybe for this miller has been throwing with purpose it would unorthodox to pull the way been pitching been unorthodox with his bullpen use all long cubs 0 3 top who falls behind 0 2 a real good hitter it feels necessary to point that out throws a ball and then gets to swing on a breaking ball that he just pops up out two
