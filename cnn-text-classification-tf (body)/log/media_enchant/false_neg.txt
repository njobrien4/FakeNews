the first part of unabashedly movie about a remarkable has some of the wondrous feeling of a fairy tale the audience is invited to imagine a time to be precise before social media or or in those a person could get which is just what happens to a little boy named who accidentally travels more than miles from his home in central to the streets of mother is a laborer in a poor village he and his beloved older supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find in the first they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market follows to a railroad where the younger boy accidentally boards an train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language with minimal and graceful and the screenwriter convey the dimensions of situation he is small and but also smart and and even as he is exposed to horrifying he is also a hero on an adventure the enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery you fear for and also root for and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling what happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated played by has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an john and sue and he has a who was also adopted from and has mental health and problems despite seems to be living in the stage of the fairy tale he moves to to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow from but memories of his life haunt and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home using sets out to on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom his accidental journey not a fast or easy and the effort takes an emotional toll on on his parents and on but you even if not familiar with the true story behind that the fairy tale will come true with strong assistance from a cast of charismatic criers and the music of and floods the viewer with big feelings if you have ever been a raised a lost a child or met a child or a mother this movie will wreck you as a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin i it is manipulative and but in a way that seems fair and transparent it quite satisfying the transition from the young to the demands a shift in tone and genre that quite achieve what felt in the first part like simplicity in the latter like simplification there enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older a full identity the movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back at the the focus shifts from the agonies of to the glories of i complain too much about for all i brought you to this review but i also help feeling a chill amid all the warm a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable it is indeed remarkable how small the world has how many problems data can how connected we all are to one another but lost and we even see what it is

is childhood the golden era of and can you get those relationships the other i took down from the shelf a beautiful novel by maxwell see you and i realized the title alone summons the unspoken the constant the relentless promise that friendship is when you are my great friend at that age was mark in those days on west mark was my constant companion and my secret whatever happened at there would always be mark to brighten the day and spit with style like river phoenix did in by via a tongue we would be up at the crack of dawn to wander over the scan the beaches for climb the hills together and sit in the graveyard comparing our plans for world domination mark had he was often in and write to each other planning our adventures for the summer he told me i was a good writer and i told him he was a great before we disappeared from each lives i seen him in years when i recently tried to find mark he appear to exist like the boys in he seemed like a or a fragile piece of memory that crumbles when you turn it in your hands he to be found at the old address i had for him in the seaside town of his name is a popular one on but none of the marks i found was the one i and he on twitter or either none of the search engines reveal anything about mark i tried death as i have for a long that my old friend might have died i asked my mother if any of her friends had kept in touch with the family but none had i could remember two of his names but they show up on the either when i went back to i drove to the square where we once and i looked up at the window of my old remembering how i used to shine a torch from there to bedroom two flashes meant good night three flashes meant see you tomorrow i wonder if technology has changed the meaning of friendship my daughter is and most things that happen to her are photographed she and her friends get together and spend hours trying out making retouching setting them to music and posting them on this or that social media network sure the girls are bonded in many of the traditional but i also wonder if ever lose sight of each which was always one of the possibilities of an aspect of its mystery i think we always knew we would move on in life and that our great friendships would be a matter of memory i have a single photograph of mark i think we were ever photographed and that adds to the notion that our friendship was a fiction social media is a vehicle of a means of fixing an idea of yourself in the social without people actually knowing you at all and a the thing about friendship used to be that the ideal was shared entirely by the pair of or sometimes by a yet it remained and that was part of its power the mindfulness i miss a pair of excellent youngsters in my wider family have over between them they say they know half of and that some of them are the social network gives them the option of corralling people into or they always have the option of clicking but are the majority of these people friends or are they just you can know everything going on in lives without knowing a single thing going on in their hearts but is that told that empathy still flowers in the usual but i have my doubts people now in their have a lot of but are i close to the point where a bad or a death in the a moment of opportunity for the protective and dignifying balms of old but simply a quiet day on social the times we live in are big on loyalty technology has driven us wild with questions of loyalty to to to a of or to brands who give out to those who stay tight but the only kind of loyalty that matters is to know your friends and stick with them the relationship has nothing really to do with outside or with your or with status and perhaps our vision of friendship has been degraded by the relentless nature of our communications technology replace and with and close the curtains and mix two download but lose yourself in the sort of communication that has nothing to sell love gets all the big but friendship is where the action especially if you consider that it is really a lack of friendship that makes an unhappy marriage the art of friendship that warms you in the various winters of your and when in trouble you want but just one is the hardest thing in the world to the late is thought to have said not something you learn in school but if you learned the meaning of you really learned and that is why i miss my old friend mark there was something there that stood outside of achievement or money or religion or reputation as i i was never photographed with mark and i never hugged him or bought him lunch either but sometimes in a dark hour look up and imagine i see not far a living guarantee that there will always be someone in life who really knows who you are when all the machines are off and when all the chips are i see his light three flashes

if you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and j various you be wrong if it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were the temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas but this the candidates share the blame i compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy and the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached using analytic tools provided by crimson i categorized the campaign news coverage of media outlets this consisted of four broadcast three cable news national public radio and on the two news and newspapers i specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like trump the khan family and the i also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs this list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy the controversies received more on than their views on the economy from until election percent of the stories mentioned various and percent mentioned email only percent mentioned trump and jobs or the and only percent cited campaign and the economy closer to the from the numbers got even more lopsided this was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before director b letter to congress from this percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy as for percent mention his while percent mention him related to jobs and the economy the imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies moving one week past the video between and election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed trump and his imbroglios a mere percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned trump and the these choices have consequences according to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state in mentions of trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail but before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign if media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals it might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics to figure out if this was the i used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and election day i coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did all over half a million ads were run in during this period the content of the ads is revealing both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character in the losing ads did little else more than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions only percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy by percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic on traits typically garner about percent of the appeals the economy typically generates about percent of the appeals usually much more balance of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the trump messaging as and the news media covered it
it happened so one moment i was running the next i was staring a sow in the so close i could smell wild and pungent and and i knew it could smell my fear i was in the middle of a rainy run in far north bicentennial park on the outskirts of where i live it was late a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the salmon swimming up creek but i was miles from the water i had planned my route away from the and i seen bear scat in more than an hour as i crested a a crash sounded from my and i instinctively moved to the expecting a moose but it was the sow with three cubs the cubs fled up a tree the sow paused in front of as if waiting i backed into the fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder moving never taking my eyes off the bear when it veered as if to leave i felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me impossible to run the trails around without thinking about bears there are piles of scat dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the reminders that you have to be careful you have to be versed in bear bear etiquette and bear protocol headphones are a and going alone is discouraged making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended i often ran alone i preferred it that way i liked the serenity and the liked the hours of nothing but me and the mountains and the trees that i wore a bear bell attached to my hydration and i whenever i came to dense areas i sang old rock roll loudly and badly i was cautious but not afraid i ran these trails all summer and the summer and while i saw bears on many other i only twice saw them on these sections maybe i let down my guard maybe i felt the way you feel when you repeat risky behavior without negative results maybe the bear was having a bad day when the bear time stood still i felt every millisecond i stood in the rain coating my face like and i did what they tell you to do if a black bear i waved my arms and yelled i my voice rising through the birch through that silent and moment a the bear paused and ran back toward the brush a minute it charged a second time and again i waved my arms and yelled and again it this time so close i could almost reach out and touch its snout i swallow i briefly and almost if this was how i would die i wanted to talk to my who was grown and off living his own life i wanted to hear his voice a lifetime the bear turned and ran its backside swaying into the trees i had to get back to the to the possibility of yet i step away from the alders it was my only protection when the bear began circling around me in a wide arc when i knew i was in became really afraid when my son was young and nothing would comfort i would talk it matter what i he needed my the steady flow of words as i stepped from the shelter of the i talked out my voice surprisingly calm i talked to the bear to show that i meant no but mostly i talked to reassure myself as the bear circled for a second i stumbled through snagging my shorts and scratching my and i talked about the day my son was how i recognized his face immediately when i reached the i kept talking the bear but i look back a half a mile i glanced over my and the bear was gone i started running and stop until i encountered two and i collapsed at their feet for weeks i saw that face in my and i woke heart pounding i swore i would never run trails but i missed it too and soon i was out with the trees and that big sky some things are worth the though i made sure to carry a canister of bear just in case and sometimes even now when i think of that bear charging and how i stood so still and yet so alive it opened something inside of me that can never be closed it offered a taste of the at any time i might find myself crouched in the face to face with my own fragile existence so much of life is chance there are no guarantees but there are vast landscapes and dangers and wild moments of good luck

there was no avoiding fearful memories of the nuclear disaster of on morning after a powerful earthquake off the coast of caused a cooling system in a nuclear plant to leaving more than spent uranium fuel rods at risk of overheating but this the electric power or the utility that operates three nuclear restored the cooling pump at the plant in about an hour and a half the plant is about seven miles south of the ruined plant where three reactors melted down five years ago after tsunami waves inundated the power station and knocked out backup generators reported that it never lost power at either the plant or its neighbor to the north after the which had a magnitude of according to the weather service took the regular actions that we should take when handling acting general manager of the nuclear power division at said at a news conference on the company was prepared for big having built sea walls rising to about feet at the plants and enclosing backup generators in waterproof said critics of which struggled to keep on top of a crisis that unfolded over the weeks that followed the calamity in said they were relieved that there had been no immediate damage but they said they remained skeptical that the company had done enough to prepare for a disaster on the scale of the earthquake five years ago that which had a magnitude of set off tsunami waves as high as feet in some places highest waves on reached about looks like the right things have been said director of the future design institute at the institute of technology and a volunteer researcher with an independent group you never know until something happens as far as this morning they did a decent but mainly because it that big of an earthquake or that big of a building higher sea for all but that is like fighting the last brown said remains to be seen how well prepared they would be for some other unusual combination of compared with five years has improved its communication with the reporting information about the cooling pump at almost as it happened on morning the company also quickly said that it had suspended the treatment and transfer of contaminated water from the where an extensive cleanup and decommissioning process is underway by the those operations had been restored i can say is response was decent and they seemed to be said director of the research center for nuclear weapons abolition at university he it would be difficult to independently verify claims because the nuclear regulation authority depends on the company to release information he added that he was not convinced that was being fully transparent about its particularly about the cleanup at the plant should be informed fully whether this operation is reasonably done with cost effectiveness and safety and making sure that the best technology is being said a spokesman for the nuclear regulation said the agency had offices on the sites of the nuclear plants and worked with and other utility companies on to confirm that the power stations were safe after the earthquake regarding the nuclear experts expressed concern about the safety of the cleanup operation at the plant the melted cores of three reactors have yet to be removed as they are still too radioactive for workers to approach since the groundwater seeps into the reactors daily the contaminated by the melted fuel needs to be treated and stored on site so has built more than tanks of about tons each the tanks are inspected four times a day to confirm that they do not said of and in an effort to halt the flood of groundwater into the damaged the company has built an underground wall of frozen dirt nearly a mile in length encircling the reactors the wall is not yet fully and groundwater continues to flow into the reactors critics worry that the sea walls or storage tanks might not withstand a more powerful earthquake or tsunami and incident at the reactor showed that quakes can set off problems even at plants that are not operating most of the plants remain closed since the but the administration of prime minister wants to restart most of them a majority of the public is opposed to such a move candidates for governor who ran campaigns opposed to the revival have won elections in recent months in two prefectures that host nuclear plants according to the a the chairman of and the were planning to meet on with one of those of to try to persuade him to support a restart of the plant there and returned to after the earthquake who oversaw an independent investigation on the nuclear accident for the said that building walls and storage tanks failed to solve the underlying problem of an country relying on nuclear power he both the government and utility companies should invest in developing alternative sources of power like solar or wind technology think we expect more of such readjusting plate movements and that has been reasonably and many volcanic activity and earthquakes have been rampant over the last five said an adjunct professor at the national graduate institute for policy studies why are we continuing to restart nuclear
maybe i have been surprised that trump could be elected but i was i live in and work in two of the most liberal places in the country but even i seeing many signs of support for him how did that blindness social media is my portal into the rest of the world my periscope into the communities next to my into how the rest of the world thinks and feels and it completely failed me in that failure makes sense spent nearly years coaching and and twitter on what kinds of news and photos i want to and they all behaved accordingly each time i liked an or clicked on a or hid the algorithms that curate my streams took notice and showed me only what they thought i wanted to see that meant i realize that most of my family who live in rural were voicing their support for trump and i see any of the that were in heavy circulation before the election i never saw a trump hat or a sign or a shirt in my and the only election day i saw were of people declaring their support for to be not blaming the algorithms for what i assume to be their role in augmenting my they did exactly what i told them to blocking out misogynist and hiding anyone who support black lives all with such deftness that i had no idea that a candidate who ran a campaign on exactly those values had gained enough popularity to win the election but considering that more than percent of our population consumes news on finding alternative perspectives have been that hard i knew about theory on filter or the idea that personalization distorts the type of information we and even i still chose to let algorithms shape how i perceive the world everything i could want to see is available at my and yet i look in mark chief executive of addressed a room of developers about the importance of his social network he has the power to bring people together who might otherwise never have the chance to meet has enabled all of us to access and share more ideas and information than ever he said gone from a world of isolated communities to one global and we are all better off for but not what has happened idealism is belied by his desire to duck responsibility for mediating the content of his site on the

understand one another but they are rapidly disappearing most social media like and is curated by software built to manage the high influx of information flowing into but there have still been a few islands of digital a of where culture thrived untouched they included vine closure was announced in and and even which were homes for marginalized theories and lifestyles the vine was the first place i got a glimpse of cultures beyond my including those of the middle east i was able to see how some women there wanted us to see aware a young woman living in who goes by the name used vine to show clips of herself living her life her version of normalcy at the goofing off at home in her most viral she stares into the her face covered in a save for her perfectly outlined eyes called me she snaps the emphasis on the last word becomes the punch line as she whips off one to reveal a second underneath i was thrilled to realize that women living there could have a sense of humor similar to my own vine was born as an and intended to be a social community but vine links could be shared independent of the and people did so with meaning that vines appeared around the defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds they could land on your screen via text direct email vine was a riff on one originally posted by a young black named who was miffed that someone thought she needed makeup to be

a powerful earthquake triggered a tsunami off the coast of japan early near where three nuclear reactors melted down at a plant in after a quake and tsunami in quake quickly brought evacuation warnings along the coast that was ravaged just over five years ago for about fears of the nuclear disaster were raised as a cooling system in one reactor in another nearby plant shut down it was restored without incident the public broadcaster exhorted residents of prefecture to leave coastal areas immediately move as far away from the shoreline as the announcer said remember the great east japan a tsunami wave of about inches hit the port of in prefecture about an hour and a half after the quake and said minor injuries had been reported the first tsunami waves hit the coast at in prefecture at about inches at the nuclear the tsunami waves rose to about three feet no deaths were immediately reported the weather service reported a preliminary magnitude of and issued a warning of a tsunami of about feet united states geological survey reported a lower the warnings were lifted in the early and people were allowed to return to their homes the electric power or reported that a cooling system in one of the reactors at a nuclear facility not far from the ruined had stopped but said there was enough water in the reactor to keep the spent fuel rods cool in the short term but the utility later said the system had resumed operations after minutes the power about seven miles south of has not produced electricity since the in which it suffered earthquake damage most of nuclear power plants have been shut down since soon after the disaster amid public concern about their safety reactors are turned but the plant still has uranium fuel in a storage pool that must be kept cool by pumping water through the reactors after the earthquake and tsunami five years three reactors at the plant melted down after tsunami waves breached the power protective sea walls and inundated the facility the water flooded buildings and destroyed electricity generators that were supposed to keep critical systems functioning in a blackout since the has been cleaning up and has started the decommissioning process officials reported that they found no damage or radiation release after initial inspections morning has struggled with the aftermath of the disaster about most of them are still at the site for the cleanup and which is projected to take as long as years one of the biggest problems is the huge amount of hazardous waste that has been generated there are more than about tons that workers have built to store water that has continuously seeped into the melted reactors from the ground since the disaster after said it had suspended the transfer of contaminated water to the tanks in an effort to stem the groundwater has built an underground wall of frozen dirt feet deep and nearly a mile in length in an effort to halt the flood of groundwater into the damaged reactor buildings the ice wall is not yet fully and groundwater continues to flow into the reactors every day appeared to have learned some lessons from the when it failed to give timely updates on released information about the status of its plants almost immediately at the peak of the nuclear people fled or were evacuated from around the plant almost people have not returned the disaster also fundamentally changed the course of nuclear power in which had invested heavily in its nuclear power stations in its quest to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and energy imports on the government was taking no chances on warning residents in tsunami zones to evacuate sirens rang continuously in the communities near the coast the public kept a huge red banner on the top of the screen all morning the disaster killed almost people as sea waves rose as high as feet at in prefecture an additional were reported missing and never found
do you remember playing pretend when you were maybe you were a a dinosaur or a princess normal when and usually harmless most children know the difference between pretending to be a superhero and jumping off the roof thinking they can fly but adults often forget for we may stop pretending to be but a lot of us seem convinced that we can pretend to be investors dangerous pretend investors think that financial pornography is so the ticker tape scrolling across the television screen all day represents actionable information real investors know it might be like going to the but they would never make a decision because of it pretend investors think it makes perfect sense to change their investments based on what they hear in the a new so he like the federal so he criticized so buy bank real investors know that they make changes to their investments based on what happens in their own lives if their goals change or there is a fundamental change in their financial then they consider an alteration but they would never make a change based on someone yelling or on television pretend investors think they need to monitor their investments all the time the little supercomputer they carry around in their pockets makes it so easy real investors know that it takes a long time for a tree to and it will not help to dig it up to see if the roots are still there the same rule applies to investments and because watching things get big slowly is not very real investors tend not to talk about that tree all that much pretend investors talk about their investments a lot they say things long or short they use jargon that often does not make though it sounds kind of impressive if you listen too closely sometimes they cheer for things like increased consumer higher or in some war real investors understand the difference between the global economy and their personal economy and choose to focus on the latter pretend investors will worry endlessly about the news in some part of the world or the impact on their portfolio real investors focus on the things they can like saving a bit more next keeping their investment costs not paying fees unless necessary and managing their behavior by not buying high and selling again when prices are low pretend investors complain endlessly about volatility in the market and external actions that have impact on the big bets they have made on individual stocks real investors have enjoyed the benefits of a market that is up more than percent in the last years so ask yourself it finally time to stop pretending
the election of j trump gives the republicans in congress a chance to act on their desire to get rid of a wish that trump mostly says he shares e and the health policy analysts for the then i think safe to say few in congress thought they would have this opportunity but like the proverbial dog who has finally caught the after untold futile republicans have finally come within reach of repealing the affordable care act now comes the essential will they actually do been promising it but i am still skeptical that it will happen i believe you disagree going to let you go first why do you think do i think do it because they so thoroughly own the idea of having passed bills to partly delay or the in the house something like times just the other day senator endorsed repeal the house and senate also agreed to do in large in a budget reconciliation bill earlier this year the only thing that prevented it was that president vetoed it i doubt trump would do the same if given a similar opportunity i know that a budget reconciliation dismantling of the law is not a full because according to the rules it can only touch provisions this excludes things like requiring insurers to take all comers for premiums that vary only by age and smoking status or preventing them from imposing coverage caps and lifetime among other measures i also must add that much less confident of a repeal partial without agreement on a replacement but turn it back to do you think the has to offer a full replacement to get its members to sign on to or can it offer something that would cover fewer people and with fewer i think they can get away with slightly fewer people and somewhat skimpier but not too much a part of me that thinks many in congress were always so willing to vote for a because they knew it had no chance of being signed into law they got credit for the vote without ever having to face the downside actually repealing without replacing would mean effectively stripping more than million people of their health without anything in return this would be an unmitigated political disaster the stories of people with diabetes and more who were suddenly stripped of their insurance and left out in the cold would very likely dominate our discussion for months that leaves more than enough time to lead to significant repercussions in the midterm elections with no democratic leaders in any branch of government to i think this would be akin to what happened in the but in reverse if they can coalesce around a plan that leave too many people then i think they could move forward but in all the years since the was republicans been able to do that do you think they what do you think that plan would look one way to get from repeal to replace that minimizes immediate political risk is to pass a plan that call for repeal for several at least after the though possibly after the election between now and there would need to be some kind of transition to whatever replaces that just dump people off coverage with no alternative but the alternatives could just be not as comprehensive or costly absolutely there will be bad stories but keep in there will be bad stories under too rocketing huge cost sharing and markets with few choices is not a recipe for political success republicans now own the task of fixing those things and doing so in a way that does not look as if making better actually in a tough policy spot get the blame if they fix or repeal the and get the blame if they replace it with something people like better health policy is a very difficult and thankless task i think opt for something they can call repeal and but they could also just let struggle and die neither looks good one other way to get out from under the issue is to kick it to the states do you think a trump working with a will offer greater flexibility to states to design their own coverage plans that could diverge from if what are some ideas states might i think very likely those in congress could punt to the states for been trying to change funding to a block grant that they can then constrain over time this will be enticing for them because it will allow them to reduce spending in the while forcing states to make the tough decisions and take the blame for cuts in either beneficiaries or services fixing the markets for those who are getting health insurance through the is a different story without some sort of market which generally been opposed the same problems that existed with respect to conditions and individual ratings will exist many people will become uninsured annual and lifetime limits could reappear lots of people will have problems getting insured i have yet to be convinced that a significant number of republicans in the house might coalesce around such a plan maybe for but not sure about the exchanges even if they likely the democrats in the senate would try to filibuster either of these plans you i think democrats would filibuster anything they could the filibuster is not set in stone a senate majority can change and some are already calling for the to do so but that appear to be what the senate will do retain the filibuster this could play to their since they can propose things they let the democrats filibuster them and take the blame when repeal kicks in with no replacement perhaps another way for republicans to get out of their political bind sure have more to discuss as president administration comes into power

on a sultry evening in late the authorities executed their very first assault on what they called the financial cupola of or the largest of the ruthless gangs that have made el the murder capital of the world until that the national civil police had followed an almost choreographed again and as they sought to cripple the gangs economically in the dead of often accompanied by television officers

raids was an absurdly tiny sum considering that the united states has designated as a global criminal organization on a par with the zetas of or the of japan on in a mission baptized operation the authorities shifted gears they deployed police officers to raid scores of supposed gang including car dealerships and motels and brothels with great they presented to the news media rows and rows of impounded buses and along with suspects identified as the financial operatives of and their collaborators among them were the supposed of the street and two other leaders portrayed as controlling millions and possessing luxuries unimaginable to the destitute gang members beneath them but the presentation was something of an as are many official characterizations of the gangs whose criminal sophistication and global reach tend to be overstated by authorities frustrated that they cannot vanquish them for that supposed chief executive officer hardly lived like a he leased a squat concrete house with a corrugated roof in a neighborhood where rents rarely reach he owned an old civic and a van in collaboration with the new el a digital newspaper based in sought to pierce the secrecy

wage of an agricultural day laborer but the gangs and its main the street gang do not distribute their proceeds equitably they use them to pay for lawyers and funeral for weapons and and for the support of those serving long prison terms and their families theirs is a criminal subsistence even many of their leaders are barely solvent the authorities call them either their intelligence is invalid or pretty said a former prosecutor who oversaw investigations until gangs are like an anthill they are all after the same something to unlike other groups considered global organized crime the

a millennial computer scientist who also writes books and runs a demographically speaking i should be a heavy social media but that is not the case never had a social media account at the this makes me an but i think many more people should follow my lead and quit these services there are many issues with social from its corrosion of civic life to its cultural but the argument i want to make here is more you should quit social media because it can hurt your career this of runs counter to our current understanding of social role in the professional sphere been told that important to tend to your social media as this provides you access to opportunities you might otherwise miss and supports the diverse contact network you need to get ahead many people in my generation fear that without a social media they would be invisible to the job market in a recent new magazine recalled when he started to feel obligated to update his every or so it seemed as if everyone with a account and a now felt pressured to run their own media and pace of the professional was now the default for he wrote i think this behavior is misguided in a capitalist the market rewards things that are rare and valuable social media use is decidedly not rare or valuable any with a can invent a or repost a viral article the idea that if you engage in enough of this it will somehow add up to something of high value in your career is the same dubious alchemy that forms the core of most snake oil and flimflam in business professional success is but not complicated the foundation to achievement and almost without requires that you hone a useful craft and then apply it to things that people care about this is a philosophy perhaps best summarized by the advice martin used to give aspiring so good they ignore if you do the rest will work itself regardless of the size of your following a common response to my social media skepticism is the idea that using these services in addition to honing skills and producing things that are my critics why not also expose yourself to the opportunities and connections that social media can i have two objections to this line of thinking interesting opportunities and useful connections are not as scarce as social media proponents claim in my own professional for as i improved my standing as an academic and a i began receiving more interesting opportunities than i could handle i currently have filters on my website aimed at not the number of offers and introductions i receive my research on successful professionals underscores that this experience is as you become more valuable to the good things will find you to be not arguing that new opportunities and connections are unimportant instead arguing that you need social help to attract them my second objection concerns the idea that social media is harmless consider that the ability to concentrate without distraction on hard tasks is becoming increasingly valuable in an increasingly complicated economy social media weakens this skill because engineered to be addictive the more you use social media in the way designed to be used persistently throughout your waking hours the more your brain learns to crave a quick hit of stimulus at the slightest hint of boredom once this connection is it becomes hard to give difficult tasks the unbroken concentration they and your brain simply tolerate such a long period without a fix part of my own rejection of social media comes from this fear that these services will diminish my ability to concentrate the skill on which i make my living the idea of purposefully introducing into my life a service designed to fragment my attention is as scary to me as the idea of smoking would be to an endurance and it should be to you if serious about creating things that matter perhaps more than my specific objections to the idea that social media is a harmless lift to your is my general unease with the this belief fosters a dedication to cultivating your social media brand is a fundamentally passive approach to professional advancement it diverts your time and attention away from producing work that matters and toward convincing the world that matter the latter activity is especially for many members of my generation who were raised on this but it can be disastrously counterproductive most social media is best described as a collection of somewhat trivial entertainment services that are currently having a good run these networks are but deluding yourself if you think that twitter posts and likes are a productive use of your time if serious about making an impact in the power down your close your browser roll up your sleeves and get to work

something is deeply wrong when the reputation and influence can be borrowed by a source that describes itself as fantasy news to claim that he has endorsed a presidential and then be through a million individual shares the attention paid to fake news since the election has focused largely on fabrications and outright because they are easy to identify and extraordinarily viral fake news is created by the kinds of people when might call their work or admit that in it for the money or for the thrill of deception theirs is a behavior that can and should be and that is and maybe to deal with for many and especially opponents of j the attention paid to fake news and its role in the election has provided a small the discovery of the error that explains everything but as the attention has spread widely even president talked passionately about it on it may lead to an unwanted outcome for those who see it not just as an but also as a way to correct the course it misunderstands a new media world in which every and is at risk of being not by argument but by sheer force false news stories posted on websites were prevalent in this election were widely shared political videos some styled as newscasts containing outright image posted by individuals and shared by and endlessly shared quotes and video clips of the candidates themselves repeating falsehoods during the months i spent talking to partisan page operators for a magazine article this it became clear that while the ecosystem contained easily identifiable and intentional it contained much more of something else i recall a conversation with a fact checker about how to describe a posted on a website and promoted on a page copied from another site by overseas contractors it tried to cast suspicion on the father of a slain who had spoken out against j trump the overarching claims of the story were disingenuous and the facts it included had been removed from all useful context and placed in a sinister its insinuating mention of in proximity to mentions of and its misleading and strategic mention of amounted to a repulsive smear it was a story that appealed to bigoted ideas and that would clearly appeal to those who held them this was a story the likes of which was an enormous force in this clearly designed to function well within economy of sharing and it probably would not run afoul of the narrow definition of stories like that one get to the heart of the rhetorical and strategic risk of holding up as a broad media offensive especially after an election cycle characterized by the euphoric inversion of rhetoric by some of and by the candidate himself as the campaign criticism of trump was instantly projected back at his or at the critics themselves puppet no puppet the this tactic was used on the language of social which was appropriated by opponents and redeployed in an open effort to sap its power while simultaneously taking advantage of what power it retained were cast as the real racists progressives were cast as secretly regressive on their own terms this was not a new but it was newly effective it matter that its targets knew that it was a a clear bid for power rather than an attempt to engage or reason the referees called but nobody could hear them over the roar of the crowds or maybe they but realized that nobody could make them listen as shorthand will almost surely be returned upon the media tenfold the fake news as widely understood and has already begun to encompass not just fabricated but a wider swath of traditional media on and elsewhere fox fake news misleading claims about ford keeping jobs in fake news the entirety of fake news this wide formulation of will be applied back to the traditional news which does not yet understand how threatened its ability is to declare things even when they are may try to address the narrow version of the the clearly fabricated posts has plenty of tools at its disposal and has already promised to use to bar sites that have been flagged as promoting falsified content from using its advertising platform but the worst identified defenders make their money outside anyway another narrow response from could be to assert editorial control over external forces tried to a very limited with trending topics members of the editorial staff wrote descriptions of trending news accompanied by links they deemed credible this initiative collapsed in a frenzy of bias accusations and political fear but it is easy to imagine a system in which a upon reaching some high threshold of or a upon reaching some cumulative could be audited and declared unreliable this could resemble experiment to tag satire articles as such a number of narrow measures could stop a fake story about the for example but where would that leave the rest of the answered and and barely better positioned against everything else that remained it would be a news environment in which almost everything there before remained the main difference being that it would have all been not fake is a place where people construct and project identities to family and peers it is a marketplace in which news is valuable mainly to the extent that it serves those identities it is a system built on ranking and vetting and and yet one where negative inputs are scarcely and where conflict is resolved with isolation that provisions for open conflict on a platform present any easy for it has been a source of constant fake news operations are closely aligned with the experienced incentives of the economy more than most of the organizations that are identifying them their removal will be an improvement the outrage at their mere and at their promotion on a platform with the stated goal of connecting the will have been justified

a century almost all black lived in the largely in rural areas by most lived outside the a great many in northern and western industrial cities in by hopes for greater economic millions of black migrants made this move did they find what they were looking in yes black workers in the north and in addition to experiencing greater social and political made much more money than did their counterparts in the south but there were also disappointments black migration to industrial cities was not met with steadily growing economic equality between black and white workers from to the earnings gap between the two groups in the north was virtually and as migration so did black residential isolation exacerbated by to the suburbs and economic stagnation by seven out of black in northern and western cities resided in which were often beset by high levels of poverty and crime scholars in the early part of the century had predicted migration would do more for black than it did what in her rich and technical account competition in the promised black migrants in northern cities and labor markets the economist employs the tools of her trade resourceful matching of data rigorous modeling of labor sweeping use of census figures to analyze the demographics and economics of the great migration as a whole more traditional often focusing on a single city a couple of and relying on less nationally representative sources like oral histories and newspaper have not typically done this does not aim to overturn the conventional explanation for sluggish black economic growth in the the decline of manufacturing and the persistence of racism in labor and housing markets but as with many other aspects of the migration her investigation both deepens our understanding of what we think we know and adds new complexities and wrinkles for as the title of her book is interested in whether black economic progress in the north was hamstrung by labor competition between and black workers fear voiced as early as by she finds that between and years of heaviest such competition did indeed lower wages for black men in the north by billion a year or percent of their median earnings absent such she black workers already living in the north would have closed more of the earnings gap with white workers she that this finding does not let racism the black workers were competing with one as opposed to with white sometimes because of discriminatory hiring practices that excluded blacks from jobs for which they were qualified and sometimes suggests even more because they were genuinely less qualified than similarly trained white workers on account of the lower quality of their schooling a reflection of racial as for the poor black urban neighborhoods that arose in the wake of the great many of which are still characterized by various forms of what should be in his provocative book dark and reform the philosopher tackles this question but he lay out a jobs program or a housing initiative as he freely he offers new political strategies or policy what he aims to do instead is both more abstract and more to challenge the common to liberals and conservatives that ghettos are best addressed with narrowly targeted government programs or civic interventions for ghettos are something more troubling and less symptoms of the of the united states they represent not aberrant dysfunction but the natural workings of a deeply unfair scheme the only real in this way of is the reform of the basic structure of our this proposal may sound too ambitious to be of much relevance to everyday debates about how to help struggling urban neighborhoods is asking for no less than an overhaul of our major economic and social institutions along the lines of those of a progressive even if you agree that the ghetto poor are not merely disadvantaged but unjustly you may still deem it wiser to focus on more immediate measures but here is where argument becomes more he contends that the injustice of ghettos places certain moral constraints on what the government may do to try to improve them in his for the state may not justifiably require people to work in order to receive welfare benefits the injustice of ghettos relaxes certain moral on the behavior of the ghetto some of whose otherwise blameworthy and punishable actions as he sees sound expressions of and legitimate resistance to an oppressive status quo cites welfare fraud and tax evasion as at the heart of these arguments is a simple reciprocity in a just you receive your fair share and contribute your fair share but if you are born into a ghetto with its social its poor its its high levels of drug use and incarceration in what have you received your fair your equitable shot at and if society has not held up its end of the the least it can when trying to patch things is respect the autonomy and of those it aims to help a poor single woman in a ghetto may not have the resources to be an ideal is willing to but if that is ultimately a shortcoming of our it adds insult to injury to structure welfare benefits has been done in the united so as to discourage childbearing thereby hindering her reproductive freedom does not deny that high jobless rates in ghettos are a problem but if some of the ghetto poor choose not to he maybe that is because they to accommodate to their place in a social order where it is possible to work full time and still live in poverty this he may not be the most basis of or the purest ethic of resistance but at least something he something that will serve to make the ghetto poor active allies in a collective effort at fundamental change in the united states is a welfare program that mandates work justified in taking even this another way of stating position
the united states is a leader in technology but it may well be a laggard when it comes to using technology for political mischief the role that fake news stories on sites in particular played in last presidential election continues to be a issue did fake news tip the balance in the can do more to prevent fake should executives dispute the notion that fake news on the social network might have swayed voters but political analysts say the warning signs of this debate could be seen in other countries years ago take the where a spokesman for its shared on an image of a girl believed to have been raped and killed by a drug dealer checkers later revealed that the photo had come from and mark write the role of fake news posted to in the recent presidential election is likely to be debated for even years but there is little doubt that the social media network has had plenty of influence in a reminder to register to vote contributed to significant increases in voter registration across the according to officials in nine states in that did not dispute their conclusion

homosexual subculture of the late century but an allegiance to the cause that baffles whose obliviousness to feelings for him goes hand in hand with his john bullish denigration of which he sees as

members of the group rather than others are in jail for advocating a resumption of the collapsed peace process with the guerrillas although few here dare use the word failing to mention how many people were killed in the attempted in any article about is also considered proof of terrorist sympathies others have been convicted of terrorism charges for reporting on a scandal in which government

saying he could not expect a fair trial in the wake of the coup attempt in addition to the some news outlets have been ranging from stations to according to the representative for reporters without borders but probably the most corrosive effect of the crackdown has been a highly effective government push for businessmen who are loyal to it to take over ownership of many of the remaining turning them into avid cheerleaders for and his policies they are all basically said who left her job as a foreign editor at a once independent newspaper that is now owned by an crony is no more critical percent of the free press is destroyed directly or said journalism is considered treason journalism has been stolen by the asked for a senior government who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with official maintained that the journalists in jail in turkey were there for criminal and terrorist not for their journalism he also said there remained many publications in turkey that were critical of the government there have been press crackdowns in turkey especially during periods of military and even and his government have used press laws and intimidation against journalists on a large scale since but the sweeping emergency powers granted to after the failed military coup against by supporters of the exiled cleric have greatly accelerated the crackdown has there been such a dark period as said a who found out by accident that criminal charges had been lodged against her for reporting on a baby killed by a police bullet at a protest in addition to and the staff members in

way it she said some of the most virulent attacks on journalists have come from journalists in the press who are known by their colleagues as first they attack the target by then personally lobby with intimidated media owners or the government to have the person fired or jailed the most notorious and effective of such hit men is a television commentator and social media activist named a nationalist

lurking behind the turmoil and the jockeying for advantage in j effort to assemble a national security team lies the more fundamental question of how he will address the immediate and complex challenges he inherits upon taking office trump has never articulated any detailed foreign policy vision beyond the vague slogan the diverse and shifting cast of potential appointees under consideration for top administration jobs has only highlighted the deep splits among conservatives about how the new administration should confront threats involving north and among and how it should manage relations with allies in and trump said in a march interview with the new describing for the first time what the phrase meant to him have been mocked and ripped off for many years by people that were from his personnel appointments to his first major meeting with a foreign leader it came in new with prime minister of japan trump faces a series of decisions that will begin to flesh out his approach to the world and provide some clue as to how he might respond to whatever crises confront him as commander in chief does mean he will use military and to wipe out emerging from rogue nuclear states to terrorist before they can do harm to the united or does it mean he calls troops back building them into a retaliatory force that can lash out if the nation is at moments during the he suggested both approaches he said he would the from areas of and he criticized president for pulling troops out too soon but he is also the man who rejected and is it always the united states that gets right in the middle of he some we cannot be the policeman of the no one knows what response to expect from a man who said he prided himself on following his instincts and has little patience for careful legalisms of his predecessor but while presidents the challenges do not here are some places and issues where will first take trump called the agreement reached with in intended to constrain from building nuclear of the most incompetent deals of any kind ever and he promised to fix it because the deal is an executive not a the new president has great latitude to alter or scrap it but two can play that the are deeply unhappy with the arguing that they never got the relief from sanctions that they were promised any effort to reopen the bargaining will also give military officers and conservatives a chance to alter the pact or threaten to resume their race for nuclear capability to the deal was not only but also badly negotiated he said of secretary of state john and his negotiating team trump said he would have left the negotiating doubled down on and never agreed to give back billions of money that belonged to and was frozen in financial institutions but when he struggled to name any part of the deal he would have walked out of the negotiations to alter with some he finally settled on a common that after will be free to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium in any quantity in decision about what to do with the deal will be an early test of his willingness to act unilaterally the nations that joined the united states in the negotiations and china not only support the but are rushing to take economic advantage of it by building commercial ties with if trump wanted to abandon the deal or reimpose they would almost certainly refuse to go along the hold a few too in they shipped percent of their nuclear fuel out of the disabled a plutonium reactor and took thousands of which enrich out of service if the deal were to be declared they would be free to their nuclear infrastructure and rebuild their now frozen until by administration it would take about a year for them to produce enough new material for a weapon longer to produce the weapon itself one option for advocated by many is to simply reimpose sanctions on for including its activities in and its continued support of terrorism the would say that violates the spirit of the agreement and leadership has already threatened that such action would nullify it it is hard to say which has sounded more confrontational in recent years about north the which has regularly warned of a to any north use of its expanding nuclear or the who spent much of the bush years plotting ways to make the regime collapse but if there is likely to be an early test of reaction to north is probably it the nation has accelerated its nuclear and its arsenal is it could have to weapons during term in his security trump will be hearing the latest estimates for how long it will take the north to build a reliable intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the public figure is five years or though some intelligence officials believe it could happen significantly sooner trump has at various times described north young as even while expressing grudging admiration for toughness so the early choice will be should trump confront the north with more missile defenses and perhaps a naval blockade to stop all trade that does not go across the perhaps that is what trump meant when he said that should use our economic power to have them should he reopen negotiations with a nation that has made clear that its nuclear arsenal is perhaps that is what trump was suggesting when he said he was willing to meet one on one with over a hamburger as yet another should he pull back forces in the pacific and let the and the deal with the he suggested just that in a interview with the new saying that if countries did not pay their fair share for he was prepared to tell you will be defending trump made before and after the that he was determined to

know this by now creating strong passwords and never using the same password across sites is one of the simplest things you can do to protect yourself from digital invasion not everyone agrees about frequent password changes most say you should use really strong passwords and no more than one password per then use the password managers but making up new combinations all the time is irritating and tempting people to reuse them or make them too simple that is one reason some experts object to frequent password changes far better to create really strong ones for every login and new passwords can pose security because hard to remember complex so you are tempted to write them down that can lead to a lot of passwords to keep track of recommends password which help store many with one master password he said he uses but knows plenty of people who use and and he have a strong reason to recommend one over another as far as making passwords up be precious about it use a random word object

for yahoo and one for outlook accounts you should also set authentication for social media accounts and other sites where available but email is the most important since many sites use email for

j election victory was powered in part by forceful opposition to what he described as an economic and political system rigged against the people for the benefit of shadowy forces in the news the banks and the government trump and his allies often describe that system with one globalism it is a word that conjures many none of them shuttered unchecked immigration and a distant cabal believers controls the economy and the media analysts who track extremist groups in the united states have expressed alarm at the use of the word by the they say it carries multiple meanings from benign to sinister and often serves as a for and conspiracy theorists is a principle driver for the fears that animate the radical right in the united said the editor of a published by the southern poverty law center is the globalism is often used as a synonym for the system of global economic interconnection that has been critiqued for decades by liberal groups like labor environmental organizations and opponents of the international monetary fund and the world bank but for the far the term encapsulates a conspiratorial based on xenophobia and according to mark a researcher at the league a host on the media site rebel explicitly rejected its use as a synonym for in a video she posted in she said the word meant rule by autocrats such as president former president w bush and the united nations who value false flag of and immigration from the third almost always sneer down their nose at disdain national laugh at religion and generally despise the west while holding a creepy affection for the third she added want open cheap labor and to benefit their business and political and are all too willing to shaft the little people to achieve the website run by k newly appointed chief white house frequently attacked globalism and during tenure there but no one may have done more to popularize the idea of a globalist conspiracy than a radio host who commands an audience of millions through his media empire he has been called most prolific conspiracy theorist in contemporary by the southern poverty law center among his the sandy hook school massacre in was a hoax and the sept terror attacks were an inside job posted his own definition of globalism to in in his trademark he described it as a digital control engineered by shadowy corporate and political elites he called it total form of the who has enthusiastically supported hailed the republican as a historical figure who appeared on his show last has in turn heaped praise upon reputation is trump said will not let you down you will be very i hope and i think be speaking a so what is trump talking about when he talks about his hope provided a definition in an email before the election last groups in the united states began to refer to globalism at the end of the cold when it replaced communism as an idea that was an danger to the said they have also referred to it as the new world and soon they saw its tentacles everywhere the shape of that conspiracy had distinctly in part because many of foes had historically seen communism as inextricably linked to said members of the far right became fixated on prominent like the businessman and philanthropist those conspiratorial beliefs were bolstered when former president bush celebrated the end of the cold war in a speech by saying it was the dawn of a world his use of the phrase was taken as proof by many that a globalist conspiracy really was afoot was very easy for especially because he was the one who said to take that ball and run with said that point the phrase became the short hand for that kind of globalism conspiracy the multiple meanings have made it a powerful political and and his frequent references to globalism have drawn in a wide and varied audience is a very efficient net to unite disparate parts of the from the mainstream to the said the director of the center for the study of hate and extremism at state professor called globalism defining folklore and narrative for the racist but said it had also a convenient to explain the various declines that the united states is perceived to be globalism was an important theme in the final

conspiratorial talk has continued after the election trump referred to a plot against him again last when he complained on twitter that protests were the work of the news media and paid protesters a trump ally and host on fox business later accused of many on the far right have celebrated election victory as a momentous blow against the globalist conspiracy last claimed on that trump had called him personally to thank him and his audience for their support and to offer to appear on his show again soon ms the trump did not reply to an email seeking comment late night then pivoted to what he thought was most the coming destruction of globalists that hijacked the primarily the news media and international business people soon they would be destroyed once and for he suggested is battling

on a evening in a mongrel is wandering between the seats in a room above a pausing to sniff handbags for hidden owner of the wee ginger dug is whose popular of that title propelled him into the midst of the that sprang up around the campaign for independence in as delivers an entertaining disquisition to the roomful of dedicated souls who have braved the wintry one could be forgiven for thinking this was another example of the phenomenon that many argue contributed to the loss of the independence yes supporters talking to here in where locals opted to remain in the by to the narrowest margin in the whole of these activists are all too familiar with the that led many independence supporters to believe that more of the country was of their view in the final giddy weeks before the need more local focus and a more so not caught in the bubble we were last says as the discussion after talk turns to strategy for a second referendum campaign members are far less about independence than their leadership got to be about and giving people the proper insists who heads the group for and the meeting with that in mind feel there are certain on currency for that are going to be asked the next that we have the answers to of independence have never stopped wanting to talk about it to anyone willing to listen so why has a national survey billed by first minister sturgeon herself as biggest listening exercise in our been such a muted barely mentioned at last annual curiously devoid of the usual social media blaring and what does that reveal about the state of the independence as well as those willing to vote for the the most significant mass of the hugely expanded membership since the first independence sturgeon challenged activists to reach everyone living in in days through doorstep discussions and town hall meetings launching it at the beginning of the leader argued that the changed circumstances brought about by the vote justified a new debate on the people responded within the first though it would be fascinating to know how many of those had previously voted against independence not one suspects the conservatives and never tire of pointing out that no voters would be far happier if their decision on were taken as their final answer local branches attest to many hundreds more survey leaflets notably devoid of heavy branding being across the country by an indefatigable core of activists which remains the envy of every other political final results which the does not intend to share publicly may well provide party with useful not least about the third of supporters who voted for and how many of them are likely to support the ultimate preference for independence in it is difficult not to conclude that the which ends on st has been something of a fools errand for those loyal they are the first to admit that the exercise has drawn a mixed with many refusing to speak to them at all those most willing to they are previous no voters whose position has changed since but polls suggest that only around a tenth of those who opposed independence in have switched and almost as many have moved in the opposite anecdotal findings only reinforce the sense that prediction on the morning following the referendum result that a second independence poll was was made in haste not least if by she meant they reflect a broader after two referendums and two national elections within voters have minimal appetite for further upheaval latest polling found limited backing for a second independence referendum before the leaves the at with the projected results almost identical to last time voting against independence and in these are the unyielding numbers staring down sturgeon as she weighs up when and whether to call a second did she hope to achieve with beyond busying the troops for a few short cynics would say just the idea was first announced at the spring well before as the leadership sought to quell calls for a speedy second referendum several senior advisers have since acknowledged that the throwaway notion had not been expected to receive such a positive response from members and independence activists not though very the same the membership grew like after her eat me there was much glee from some quarters about how the would cope with this rabble of and conspiracy madly straining at their reins towards a second and there has been a tendency ever since to treat them like toddlers in need of constant has forgotten how to fight for social justice read the majority of new rather like the have revealed themselves to be profoundly just like those activists in they have been waiting patiently to dissect the failures of the campaign in a formal party setting some warned when the survey was announced that any initiative focused on the of who voted to remain within the would undermine the far more pressing internal it is axiomatic that members want they are far less than their leadership fears when veterans of independence movement staged an alternative fringe festival to run concurrently with the annual conference in last it ended up being complimentary and not the insurgency that some had it did reflect many independence at the way grassroots energy has been into winning elections for the at the lack of consensus or strategy on big questions like the at the failure to establish a forum to dissect and build up the failed arguments of arguments were always loosely divisible into those appealing to heart that bubble mentality now met with such caution by experienced campaigners and those to head perhaps more significant to the than itself has been the political response to it in at a point when the case for independence in the context of plummeting oil and government deficit was looking distinctly xenophobia has been a gift for sturgeon
prime announced participation in the program to resettle central refugees from a camp after attending president summit on refugees in from a surprise in at his little attention has been given to the details of this new policy or about the camp itself this is particularly notable with reiterated immigration policy not to settle any illegal maritime arrivals many of the central refugees will have crossed their borders via overland critics might concentrate on whether this announcement was price of entry to the summit or even speculate it is part of a agenda to woo power player it is important to unpack and understand what this new decision means tangibly for the migrants and us in ban on asylum seekers to us says immigration head read what do we know about the camp in what is the humanitarian migration what are they fleeing and after what does this mean for humanitarian program in have been fleeing serious gang violence in the northern triangle of central el and for is the second most dangerous country to live after as gang members target young boys to destroy businesses and abuse girls and women murder rate is the highest in the world at homicides per in according to the office of drugs and crime the average is armed gang members are destroying local businesses the police or law enforcement does not deliver criminal justice no rule of law is in proper place highly corrupt governments fail to protect its violence is not strictly covered by the refugee convention migrants fleeing from gang violence fear their safety back home but they do not face persecution corrupt officials involved in violence can justify the failure to protect their therefore it is indirect state persecution by critics in the us also said granting migrants a refugee status was a redefinition of a refugee but the administration acknowledged the urgency of this humanitarian crisis where innocent children were targeted by gang has detrimental side effects economic and malfunctioning public including hospitals and are indirect consequences of the state failure to guarantee public safety and personal severe droughts have worsened the conditions in central even there was hurricane in the flows of humanitarian migrants fleeing from poverty and natural disasters are likely to continue and grow women and children are particularly vulnerable unaccompanied minors and mothers with children have been crossing borders to the us and this the administration announced it would work with the and to process refugees from central on top of the program opened in at the regional the among nine countries in north and central concluded a series of comprehensive recommendations in to address the plight of people fleeing violence in el and action the government of entered into a protection transfer arrangement with the and the to receive applicants most in need of immediate protection after by the us government in their countries of refugees from the northern triangle of central to the there were new applications registered in in which was a increase from among were from the a increase from the previous migrants are in are roman catholic and another are protestant in el are catholic and are protestant in el abortion is subject to jail terms even when pregnancy is caused by rape and the pregnant woman is under age same in are is an innovative emergency resettlement mechanism that can process up to individuals at heightened risk it has undergone its initial pilot phase first beneficiaries come from el and are being relocated to the us discussions are under way with potential additional transit and destination countries this includes over integration and public main reason central refugees want to go to the us is that the richest country in their region where they already have families and friends to rely on they find and survival tips through these social networks which is an important pull factor for migrants for this even is not easy for them to integrate may be an attractive place for central but far away from their countries of origin across the pacific where they may not necessarily have the networks to support them for smooth transition and successful they need community and businesses to offer jobs for their and successful integration governments alone support newly arriving migrants who may end up relying on government subsidies they need community support and over refugee deal is tough for people who have little resilience left read of raises another serious concern for those across central has been as a pandemic disease by the world health which causes birth defects in babies born to mothers with the virus cases were reported in countries in central including the northern triangle the prevalence of gang violence and the absence of proper public health systems in the region make it difficult for health professionals to reach patients and eradicate the disease if the virus spreads further in the migration flows would it means for questioned by journalists at the summit in new denied that there was a deal with the us taking refugees from and island after two the government announced a new us deal to transfer some of the detainees from and to the us difficult not to think of it as a swap deal not a refugee swap but a bundle swap we still know in the with trump winning the election and implementing the deal no the faith of refugees in both camps looks quite bleak he may think not a fair deal to swap refugees from with minors from is renegotiating with calling the deal a of speculating unknown details of the deal over vulnerable populations across the we need to think about the consequences of this policy decision in the regional context what we do know is as of they are including in and new guinea who are mostly genuine refugees they be settled in but will be sent to the us the swap deal sounds like an solution to a very simple problem in a expensive
appearing on that most revered of presidential forums called trump released a video this week describing his plans to great again for and i mean learned not to believe magnanimous but others really want told on that we should give trump opportunity to develop the positive objectives that he may and told an audience in that he wants be respectful of the office and give the an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off in every forgive because about to pop off have you lost all sense of you and talk as if we have no idea who trump is or what he has been saying for months on end but trump has made it abundantly clear opportunistic words of inclusion notwithstanding that his administration will be loyal to the fringes of the united leaving even the republican establishment running behind announced cabinet choices simply leave no room for imagining a gentler at the helm of the those of us concerned about the fate of the undocumented or the environment or reproductive rights see much reason to worry with the selection of mike and general t to inner circle list reads like a roll call to the dick fan among many other troubling all these men also share a deep antipathy to views are as scary and they are well known pick for national security adviser has called a and stated that is a political that behind this notion of it being a that is not talking about the that republicans frequently invoke but about asked about current republican national committee chair and designated chief of staff told news that are some aspects of the faith that are very i realize that was a scholar of or perhaps even a a renewer of the faith according to popular comes to revive the practice of for following generations or maybe he just said an ignorant thing that would sound bigoted if it were about another religion but today sounds like comments are troubling rather than enabling establishment republicans as a moderating influence on the the trump administration is pulling the traditional down its own giving less extreme republicans about as much voice in this new administration as chair actually worse at least the chair had the good sense to stay quiet my worry extends beyond the realm of what this administration says and reaches into what it will do building a wall on the border is a near physical impossibility the immediate deportation of millions of people is much harder to execute than it sounds but the that can and most likely will secretary of state another hardliner who is in the running for homeland security recently met with trump and was photographed holding his strategic plan for first openly in his hands nobody give this man the nuclear plain for the world to see was the of an useless program of the bush administration officially called and more commonly known as i remember vividly the panic and confusion among the of new city when special registration was first enacted in this which required visa holding men from countries and north to register with the was a massive failure even the own auditor found the program to be ineffective and a huge waste of resources the cost to taxpayers was more than a year and the program alienated around the world from the united states families were torn apart because of special and the brilliant program netted a grand total of zero terrorism registration was useful only as a tool to disrupt average lives and to spend a lot of money needlessly it served no security function and trump is considering reviving it we can assume because it will make this government like doing on the backs of ordinary then this justifying a registry on fox trump surrogate positively invoked internment as a legal precedent for the program that heinous comparison led the new times to publish an by a law professor reassuring us even if the legal decision authorizing internment has never been we be worried because the judiciary now sees the legal justification for internment as constitutional that whole exercise is nuts the question is not about the constitutionality of internment the question is why the hell are we talking about internment are we seriously working through the legal likelihood or unlikelihood of holding large numbers of completely innocent people in detention racial hysteria led us down that road once to say that panic lead us down a similarly treacherous with or without a legal precedent beginning to feel like one major terrorist attack from martial law in this and the new administration even taken office yet a fiction in the us that is frequently promoted by the likes of fox news and that had a major impact on this election the notion is that in our multicultural white get theirs while every minority and special interest group gets extra privileges the idea cultivates a mood of bitterness and even if fundamentally untrue many honestly believe that are getting special privileges that some accept will lead to the imposition of sharia law in this country but this is ludicrous want special privileges we just want to be treated the same way that everyone else is treated going to get special registration hardly a fair need more than assurances from trump that thinking about the whole country when he invokes we need to know that equality under the law will be guaranteed under his administration in what we really need to be doing is proving to all that everyone deserves to be treated equally while acknowledging all of our and that the kind of equality that makes for a stronger until that day every one of us needs to be popping off while we because if we there may come a time when popping off is not just useless but illegal pop everywhere you whenever you can pop all afternoon and evening pop all
the government has been given a blunt warning to stay out of the business by a senior leader in the who lambasted for his and insisted would have say any in the future of the first has accused the government of sending out a welcome message to nationals speaking to investors at the annual asset management conference in she more than anything our economic success will depend on nurturing the talent of those already in and of those who believe ours is the kind of welcoming country that allows ambition to position of the government and some others is very different from the refusal to guarantee the status of fellow nationals living in and the to the threat to draw up lists of foreign the government seems intent on sending out a welcome am determined that we send out a different one that says to all those working and studying in that they are most definitely welcome all from me for for the comments my colleague the diplomatic seems to agree with sir man in us today briefed national security council on the implications of trump election imagine doing but sir who himself served as ambassador in has told the independent that that giving the job to would be the financial foreign affairs thinks that appointing as ambassador to the us might not be such a bad idea after all an extract from his ft instant insight column what is the first job of a ambassador to it is to get close to the white house would have an unprecedented closeness to the us the kind of access that other ambassadors could only dream of he campaigned alongside the after the had a personal meeting with trump well before may prime was given a perfunctory minutes on the phone could also play an important role in securing one of most important a deal with the us unlike i believe that decision to leave the is a disastrous mistake which will inflict economic damage on but we are where we are given has got itself into this absurd we need to look for escape routes is probably one of the few people with a chance of persuading the trump administration to make a trade deal a top of the reasons for rejecting a ambassadorship amount to little more than wounded pride suggestion is a humiliating breach of protocol it is just a foretaste of the indignities that trump is likely to inflict on over the next four years looking forward to that state visit to the statistics authority has reprimanded the department for education for sending out a misleading tweet about grammar civil service world reports leading doctors have expressed concern over the impact could have on the the press association reports if there is a dip in the number of surgeons who work in the there could be a vice president of the royal college of surgeons said he told the house of lords committee on the sustainability of the that recent years had seen an increase in the number of surgeons who were coming to work in the around one in five surgeons in the in england come from the said he percent of surgeons on specialist registers in this country trained overseas these half trained in and the other half trained outside and what has happened in recent years is the number of people coming from outside has been diminishing while the numbers coming from within has been if that tap was to be turned off there could be potentially a significant problem certainly for prof president of the royal college of told to of our workforce is from the done the numbers yet because it is still up in the i think suffice to it is not on the department of most senior civil servant told the public accounts committee that issues surrounding workforce from the was one of the main priorities for the team working on on the daily politics mike the armed forces said that the government was now backing a private bill that would making posing as a veteran and wearing medals that you have not earned a criminal whole government is going to back this now on penning said the bill has been tabled by the conservative mp who says who pretend they have won medals for when that is not the should be punished a former captain in the royal marines who received the conspicuous gallantry cross for his service in told the that the bill was unnecessary he i think just going too far to suggest someone could go to prison i think very important to look at going on with someone that is actually pretending that they served in the armed forces there may well be a serious mental health problem and actually that person just has low not a threat to the and they actually need professional help downing street and the foreign office have slapped down a suggestion from the us that would be a good ambassador to as said the inflammatory views made him a poor candidate for a diplomatic electoral commission has begun an investigation into whether broke election funding laws by apparently using money from a parliament group to fund failed attempt to win a and in the the foreign has for attacking stance on climate change during foreign office questions in the commons he also claimed that hoped to and the actions of the trump administration and and a and chair of the party in the has said he thinks the wants to stay in the single market speaking after a meeting with the in the weber what we really expect are clear proposals in my talk with unfortunately i have not heard anything i have not heard much as to how the government wants to tackle and what really means i have not received any new quite the opposite is i have been told that the as far as the economy is it
a wonderful and discussion of an immensely complex and issue some final forcing the hand of policy makers and developing responses to poverty are vital to elephant conflict cannot be but we can try to control how humans network of parks and wild lands is needed to allow elephants to roam out demand and the legal market in china is going to be but the government appears to be for the future is not but it is probably limited to small pockets of land an entirely i will but my this excellent panel give us measured hope for the future many countries afraid it will not possible we often forget central and west where elephants are in many areas doomed if we cannot stop the current elephant poaching your grandchildren will probably be able to see wild elephants only in a handful of in the eastern and southern tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat build community support for reduce reduce trafficking through market and dramatically reduce demand for the number of places with significant numbers of wild functioning as they will be very much smaller than now but there is real think so because high value tourism areas will be maintained they might be like and in in getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the know what the word in is for pest animals with no value vermin current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of rural communities i think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant specialists talking about the just local abundant populations in one or two we can get ivory under control and poaching significantly lessened and i strongly believe that if we do want simply islands of elephants but migrating we have to plan this now and in the next years while we have something to work with this applies in where the elephant specialist group just met last week for all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the question is back to you are you with we need you to make your desire known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their habitat elephants are whose elephant family focuses on elephants paints a frightening picture of the future the past years of elephant populations have been wiped out without this iconic animal could be facing extinction within which is why this species is listed as endangered they now number as few as across countries in with probably occurring in habitat loss of and fragmentation of populations are causing and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing as well as hunting for ivory though not all elephants have tusks and females do have retaliatory killing for such as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains or setting out poison bait such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants have been reduced to crop especially in places where people have settled and have no history of living or knowing how to live with stiles also thinks things are looking bleak destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer it remarkable how well they done in and when you think of the population pressures it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase in and carvers are still churning out the and read how various states are planning what can be done says we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more where elephants need to move and what they need to eat we can lessen the interaction between people and elephants and help people safely we can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are ready with the so there is but we need to act now as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal poaching in we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in to protect space and empower people to allow our largest land mammal still have room to roam our biggest project at the moment with other is our corridors campaign on asks why we use funds from tourism to support local communities so they turn to just not enough to go says there are working examples of involving local communities in the way you it simply a drop in the ocean there are million and millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually with tourism and you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or brokers to create havoc a huge human toll behind the ivory trade and poor exploited people are a big part of it the same situation in even with the number of poor people who actually benefit from it whose lives are uplifted by its effects is a very small number whatever the solution it has to be more though out and must benefit the poor community in money also fails to reach the communities says hedges the reason is that entrenched big businesses that are not set up to provide significant benefits to the local people in and around the areas corruption is sometimes a problem too governments need to do more to and otherwise help local initiatives and to require more equitable benefit sharing by the big operations you are correct to say that in can generate see the paper i referenced weaver g c complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal conservancies in says there is an important role for development aid to play to fill these gaps think community needs are greater than the support they are
often claims to possess the finest justice system in the with a approach to the law this justice is neither nor is it the justice system has been used to and then from england onwards in between and during the more than were executed by the colonial backed by the foreign and commonwealth office this appalling figure represents the most liberal use of the death penalty in legal history and is double the number of those executed by the during the war of liberation in years more recent judges have enforced the unjust laws informal name used for laws which still disproportionately affect it can be argued that racism is embedded in the of the judiciary and that it has proved uniquely resilient to education or to what extent is racism present in the system a study headed by published last makes for very disturbing statistics regarding how differently and white suspects were dealt with in the criminal justice system helped to trigger race training for all judges over a period those statistics have not improved if you are an man you are more likely to be remanded in custody than if you are you are also likely to obtain a custodial sentence of months compared to your white months this is not because men commit more serious than their white counterparts these are punishments handed down for the same or similar men are also subject to receiving immediate custodial sentences with fewer previous convictions than their white counterparts our perceptions have become the reality that means of all young people in detention are now from communities if you are you are more likely to be remanded in custody than if you are is critical is that the report yet the fundamental racist disparities in the administration and dissemination of justice there is a crisis of both trust and confidence in the judicial system among black communities their concerns are that it remains inconsistent and discriminatory this interim report proves them right despite its diplomatic homelessness and drug addiction all play their as does the disproportionate influence of an institutionally racist police which means black defendants are stopped and searched seven times more often than their white counterparts this is despite falling and falling crime and search is a disgrace across the not just in our cities read significant responsibility for this disparity of treatment still lies with an overwhelmingly middle class and male magistracy and resistant to ethnic which hides behind the fallacy that justice is blind and cannot expect to have a diverse judiciary and and to recruit police probation prison officers and lawyers who look like us and are knowledgeable of our if we are forced to operate in a system that is itself unwilling or unable to deliver justice equally to all as martin king is not possible to be in of justice for some people and not to be in of justice for all out of members of the high court there is not a single while only two are of origin less than of oxford and graduates whom of high court judges are are of origin the legal pipeline and the outcome are a prophecy the race training introduced in was only introduced on the basis that high court judges were as they simply did not require it that rather arrogant intellectual exception must now be comments last night suggest that he knows judicial diversity needs tackling i am currently suing the ministry of justice for race discrimination and arising out of short speech on judicial racism and human rights i gave it was at a meeting to protest at the decision of an electoral deputy high court judge to ban the former mayor of tower from holding public office for five years the allegation was that i indirectly a fellow the first time any judge has ever faced disciplinary action for this months in there was an attempt to suspend approved by several high court and the judicial conduct investigations who threatened me with a formal suspension this was at the same time that a fellow immigration judge of origin had her complaint of sex and race discrimination ignored while the three white judges accused were never faced with suspension a fellow district judge still faces disciplinary sanctions for a minor complaint that at most was a competence and three other judges are currently suing the ministry of justice the treatment of judges by our white colleagues demonstrates a culture in which we are not accepted as equals with a fundamental right to challenge discrimination little wonder then that defendants and litigants face race discrimination in all minorities more likely to be jailed for some report finds read if one achieves a of judges and the injustice is unlikely to be eradicated if the culture of who is perceived to be the likely recidivist or the most offender persists the only solution is the one resisted by the ministry of and by most senior judges that is monitoring each crown court and magistrates so that there can be proper scrutiny of individual courts to identify where the problem to this must be a full by the sentencing council that sentencing and bail guidance must set out clearly the levels of disparity for each simply pretending the problem does not exist is a recipe for unconscious but appalling levels of racial bias to continue training on race from to as it forced judges to engage with mentors who challenged subconscious bias and racism as equals in a secure setting the race awareness training in the years since has been discredited as wholly ineffective it is too conducted infrequently and by fellow judges who themselves are part of the judiciary is a pillar of our democracy with a historical responsibility for the racism that affects our fundamental freedoms and rights if that is to it

bloodbath of an a friend emailed me watching someone get another said over the phone and this in an email from a veteran of the third draft dodger is now commander in to the full flowering of the era of which began with that now glide down the escalator at trump where trump commenced his candidacy with these historic when sends its not sending their best sending people that have lots of and bringing those problems with us bringing drugs bringing crime rapists and i are good ever a monument is erected to the trump then surely these words shades of will be carved into the marble along with coming out of her bucks a and would bring back a hell of a lot worse than in true demagogic trump bypassed the head and spoke directly to the to the biles and bubbling acids of raw emotion he said things that many temperate hardly dared to admit we carried in ourselves were hardly aware of just how deeply we resented our own how angry our interior lives with all this stuff bottled years and years of internalized from a culture that kept insisting on tolerance many discovered just what a drag political correctness was all these and to be free of freed from this code that was jamming us that was relief akin to a primal scream from the start rallies had the air of the tent that same hot thrum of militant exorcism and not fool a friend wrote stand anything but cold honesty right now this is not a winning the which would be bad enough this is white supremacy tempted to say really not that bad stances are things get said in the heat of a and we could take heart in the newly conciliatory trump on display for several days after the election then came the news that the erstwhile chairman of the trump campaign who bears a striking resemblance to the town drunk on the old was named counselor and chief for the incoming trump administration the mainstream press still feels compelled to explain the term but we know we we we white aka honky dig too deeply into the family along with glistening of apocalyptic and a style sense that falls somewhere between for and eye for the straight prior to his gig on the trump spent four years as chairman of which he proudly declared to be

black church in south it high and the confederate flag proclaims a glorious myself not sleeping at a friend wrote first president endorsed by the noted another then there was being on the day after the have to remember that actually all on one a character is his as and what a twisted fate indeed that ever seeking to reconcile and accommodate an pastor in once his presidency is will no longer have to be the least threatening black man in has had to deal with an opposition that very much regarded him as not on the team there was the for starters the conspiracy theories the terrorist founder of teenage crack dealer hanging out on the corner this damage done to is said during one of the republican which is a laugh if wanted to trash the all he had to do on taking office in was sit on his hands and let the hot mess of the bush economy continue its meltdown to the issue is bigger than any particular president after his on one the is that we all go forward with a presumption of good faith in our fellow because that presumption of good faith is essential to a vibrant and functioning goes to the heart of the matter the system of constitutional government is founded on deliberate fragmentation of the of and and that we all learned in high school civics for government to be effective for government to meet the needs of the people the us constitutional order requires a healthy measure of good faith cooperation among the players this good faith began to fray in the early as leaders in newt and tom delay chief among declared war on all efforts even from those in their own party to govern from a stance of bipartisan cooperation in world of moral were enemy of normal and his allies were fighting no less than a with and as he declared in a speech to the heritage war has to be fought with a scale and a duration and a savagery that is only true of civil so began the constitutional hardball and tactics that have characterized the past of politics you may recall the government shutdowns of and over budget and the impeachment of bill for lying about a in more recent there was the famous dinner at a steakhouse on the evening of the day of inauguration at which congressional leaders with by then a highly paid k street vowed to sabotage presidency by opposing every item on the new economic agenda at a time when jobs a month were disappearing including those items previously supported or even proposed by the all rooting for said of trump when they met recently in the oval office if he senate republican leader later summed up the stance when he publicly single most important thing we want to achieve is for president to be a burying was the and if bringing him down required shredding the constitutional then to hell with the past years of constitutional order the once reserved for only the most major policy became routinely deployed even for matters by withholding funding or refusing to consider appointments to government the senate effectively nullified laws that had been duly enacted in accordance with the constitution at a time when the federal courts had a record number of
he must be disappointed by that typo in the first line of the email that was my first thought when the following landed in my might sound shocking and but i feel shocked or threatened this was just another day on the where people disproportionately people of color and queer people are intimidated and threatened what writer describes as a ceaseless flickering hum of emotional women abandoned to their abusers read around the same time i assume the same signed me up to a which meant i received thousands of unsolicited email newsletter within a few hours thankfully filters learn but it took a minutes of flagging messages to clean up my a mild irritation meanwhile on someone else was sending me pornographic and asking whether penis size matters for a i blocked as sure i will have to block many others in the future in a tedious game of would love to say that this is but not in go as far as to say that this feels entirely just your regular rape threats and dreary dick for one of my is dealing with racial slurs or having her profile photo edited to have for a male people telling him to commit suicide or saying they want his kids to die if we complain about these either overreacting or feeding the trolls but if we speak letting them get away with it by this we fall back on swatting the antagonists away like flies perhaps as a coping telling ourselves that normal most of the the flies are few and far between but you only have to look at the relentless campaigns of hate against public figures like actor and comedian diver tom or games developer to see what happens when the flies form a swarm it becomes exhausting and incredibly difficult for the individual or the police to make on what constitutes a credible in the media you are familiar with how things work but for an average person these types of interactions could be said author of this is why we have nice how did we get and what should we do about many are aggrieved white men who feel like they given the fantasy life they were author of bullies have always found ways to antagonize but digital tools have given them new powers fifty years ago if you wanted to wind up a you could write anonymous messages and leave them on his or her could tease that but there would be no archive and it be amplified it could potentially be upsetting but it be indexed in said the ability of search to index abuse or what she calls that changes the ethical stakes your history follows you meaning those targeted struggle to move on and have a fresh and have been part of the since its inception a side effect of anonymity and unfettered free both critical pillars of the web once restricted to niche forums and with their own codes of ubiquitous social media has brought it into the used to be so few people occupying those spaces and the people who were were a lot more than what you see said means more and more just teenagers in their basements a lot of them are otherwise very well adjusted normal adult men with wives and children and said author of of them fall into the camp of very aggrieved middle aged white men who feel like they given the fantasy life they were owed they tend to take it out on people who are successful or present in a way that makes them feel not to say that white men get harassed but that harassment is more frequently directed at members of historically underrepresented populations whose voices have not always been privileged people who have always had their voices taken seriously tend to be the said arguing that it comes from a sense of trump that same sense of disenfranchisement that propelled trump to the white house with a campaign that normalized says absurdly offensive degrading things about women and people of color and specific groups whether whatever he says these terrible things and that normalizes hate speech in mainstream discourse so normal to open up or any news and see says tenor of discourse that trump and his associates have been engaging in has emboldened some people to say are in charge now and we can say whatever we adds a student at school of communication and comments about sexually harassing women are a reflection of the normalization of violence against threats and rape threats are a form of domination that has been used against women for all of time it ties into seeing women as not fully human and having their value contingent on whether or not they are worthy of said in an effort to draw attention to the ends up amplifying it publications might be trying to troll but some are just calling attention to it but inadvertently or not it ends up more problematic said opens up the vexing question of whether or not to feed the trolls wary of that framing as it comes with a undercurrent the message is you give them attention you get said suggests keeping a record of posts in case a situation escalates and then reporting the perpetrator where possible individuals should make up their minds about whether they mute or following safety guides like this one or this offers an alternative way to handle such by creating a to an explicit against these behaviors as opposed to repeating she said about taking more control of that so that the antagonist is no longer the center of the suggests the rest of the community can help here solidarity is asking how you can help is important basically trying to take a stand and say is not same behaviors that can marginalize and denigrate and traumatize can really bring a group making them feel good and paltry effort was to take
the autumn statement on will be the first time in years will be nowhere in sight for a major fiscal event there will be many who breathe a sigh of relief at that alone but his presence will be heavily least as the budget last march contained a black hole as the decisions he had made for the previous six years started to catch up with him it also poses the first major test for the new i ask him a simple will you genuinely change course on the it is a simple yes or no but it defines the entire approach he takes to this autumn the vote taught us anything it is that many people are demanding change the chancellor and the prime minister may want to blame for our current economic plight as a recent leaked treasury document the damage to public finances was done before the referendum has simply exposed the fact that the last six years were wasted and that the economic policy they supported every step of the way has failed so many in our budget in march was a prelude to when the are set to fail by their own measure breaching their own fiscal targets set out in the conservative manifesto they said they would cap welfare spending and yet they have breached their own cap while punishing working families they said they would increase business investment with huge corporation tax but it is decreasing and companies are sitting on huge cash not most of all they have failed because they did not equip our economy for the challenges that poses the have no answers to meet the task i gave a speech in which i said we now need a positive approach to let me be clear i will continue to oppose a that is because the want to take a approach with a minuscule increase in infrastructure a pernicious immigration the destruction of workplace rights and environmental alongside a race to the bottom in taxes for the rich and in wages for the rest of us will oppose them every step of the way in parliament and insist on full accountability for their negotiating a i respect the referendum result not to do so would sow even deeper divisions within our society but that does not mean we cannot use the period of the negotiations positively to work with our social democrat and progressive friends in to construct a new relationship based upon and democracy has long argued that there are aspects of current single market regulations that should be reformed the negotiations provide an opportunity to work with partners to advance those such as state aid rules and enforced deregulation and will press the government to take up that opportunity we must move the debate on from the divisions of the referendum and bring people together we must look to the not the have no more a plan for our economy than they do for it is why their handling of the negotiations has descended into a shambles and why now making up deals factory by factory as the foreign secretary it looks like a will be a they still put the rich ahead of the rest of us by making working families pay for the giveaways to a wealthy few for of the population are getting a tax cut worth a year on while cuts to universal credit will leave more than two million families on average of a year worse was always a political not an economic necessity that is why we need an autumn statement that is on the side of working families and with polices that are equipping our economy for the autumn statement must meet three we need a credible fiscal which is crucial not just for the public finances but also to help us to invest in our economy so we can create jobs and growth the government should target a balanced current budget five years ahead and separate capital expenditure from spending to best do this they should replace the fiscal framework with fiscal credibility rule we would also set up a national investment bank with a regional banking network it would mean we could invest properly in our country and start to address regional the commitment to the has always been a media just like the the government is only paying lip service to people in the north of but it continue to just old it needs to deliver on them the fact that only one in five projects in the infrastructure pipeline is in construction shows that the government has not been meeting its own promises the rail electrification plan has been in the last few weeks and the government is failing to commit seriously to develop for the north of england wants to set up a of the so that we can channel the vital funding and investment that the region we need actual support for those in work on low and middle who will struggle as prices rise the chancellor can start by introducing a real living wage he needs to provide honest solutions to the childcare crisis he should reverse the giveaways to the wealthy and reverse those such as universal credit and employment and support to low and middle people are indeed about but that is directly due to economic policies that have a rich few over the rest of and left many in our country behind while a few at the top have soared we need secure and properly funded public services with the at breaking with a and social care in with one million people not receiving the care they there can be no more fudges on funding the same applies to local authority which has been cut at nearly every fiscal event under the the autumn statement needs to be ambitious for by a genuine change by not more cuts and half measures austerity should not be but ended once and for it
begins with an extravagant have to take a big chill pill in all of as my daughter would the conservative mp flops into a chair in her portcullis house which looks out over the getting so worked up really got to calm take a step and put our cool heads following hour feels like being caught in the path of a hurricane i been on the receiving end of this sort of sustained thunder since i sat through a sermon by a baptist preacher happened to our lost the plot lost the ability to be brave and stand up for what we believe is blisteringly angry about and furious with the the the even at one point herself in the interests of strict almost everything she says should be reported in capital letters or and probably both if this is idea of a chill i would love to meet her after a double brands fox free trade speech read mp began her career as a television then became a criminal and was elected to parliament in a single mother of and a passionate supporter of the she served as a junior minister under and was very much a part of his detoxification project got rid of the and made us kept her first as parliamentary undersecretary of state for then for and then as a junior minister at the ministry of followed by the department for business in the summer leadership voted for may and remains a supporter of the prime minister but lost her job in the new government a lifelong the is incensed by what is now happening to her party and as she puts a proper i say exactly what i gets it first actually now have a foreign secretary who said the tells us what quantity of bananas allowed to buy just and the after this diplomatic spat over would she say is helping cause in glowers think should understand the consequences of us leaving the single market and the customs only this met the directors of a pharmaceutical company say which who told her that they will take jobs and relocate to if we leave the single market needs to talk to as i do and the rest of his people need to get twitter think that on channel news in via if we do leave the single believe immigration levels will go down at the stats this we are almost at full employment if we are going to be the vibrant economy that we we need migrant workers that is the reality of what is going to happen all those people in they vote leave to our they voted to reduce the number of people living in from the means reduce what people in voted for they voted for less now from is saying have a visa and people can come here if they have a job she narrows her eyes will there be or the same levels of refused to answer the because the answer to the question would the same so you tell if we leave the single what happens in when those people who voted leave they will not see a reduction in the number of migrant workers in their pauses just long enough for me to ask her what she thinks will be even more and they will feel even more betrayed and i do fear about the consequences for our politics the democratic deficit will not by what happened on those people in need to look at the the the the of this who have led them down a garden path into a very very unpleasant forest of anything she is even angrier with the opposition benches greatest betrayal of the liberal left in this country is by the party the profoundly peculiar thing at the moment is that the two most liberal on the subject of who will stand up without fear and make the positive case for are and in the face of from the party the who i know agree with but are literally caught between constituents who voted overwhelmingly to and a and bobtail of all sorts of who might terrified they speak up for immigration absolutely pathetic left it to an old like me to do will come as no great surprise to anyone that is routinely subjected to a barrage of abuse from both left and right she says that members of the hard left have proposed that she be hanged and that tweeters have told her she is part of the swamp they intend to drain her critics

dim view and issued a public but sound terribly sorry or wholly convincing when she claims this was in no way the same thing as being not me deriding she before swiftly breaking presumably that derision is exactly what it was she tries again me taking the mickey out of him me finding not a personal she breaks off as that wash either not hateful not the same as hating somebody i anybody i dislike she thinks for a moment only person i think i actually do dislike is john i actually do think a nasty piece of because an apologist entitled to call him a nasty piece of work because of what he said about the i follow why this constitutes a justifiable nor if it she also dislike and martin too i she goes on is feels on firmer ground with the media taken leave of its senses hysterical headlines are afraid just becoming acceptable i think the daily mail is just appalling at the she has nothing but praise for sensible face of our and is a big fan of the current campaign to persuade advertisers to boycott newspapers that print xenophobic smears against

voters think success in overcoming sexist obstacles to her candidature would make any difference to their own lives rather than identifying with her as someone facing a shared they seem to have dismissed her as a privileged beneficiary of a status quo they can why labels the poll a rejection of the politics of identity and a return to the politics of what does that actually many pundits and

a man who uses misogynistic language and has been accused of sexual assault is soon to become the president of the united states of for feminists desperate to see the first female the result was how could someone with such disregard for rights become trump boasted about being able to freely grope women because he is and by the end of the race different women had come forward to accuse him of sexual assault he also suggested during his campaign that women should face form of for having before backtracking and saying states and congress should take the lead with lawmaking on this matter after the publication of a video in which he describes women by the experts and many predicted that lost the female vote but this turned out to be incorrect it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their to exit of white women voted for trump those without a college degree supported trump over democrat candidate by nearly two to one white women with a college degree only narrowly voted in of by six percentage points by of black women and of voted for some feminists are finding it difficult to comprehend why women so offended by misogyny that they voted for en mass we interviewed women across to find out why they voted for trump and why they describe themselves as feminists what they a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own worker who lives in the much state of voted for trump she describes herself as socially financially independent and educated female i either friends or except for one voted for trump i want to show it was not only men or educated citizens that voted trump i am an economic conservative who is registered as a affiliate i feel that trump has the best economic polices to create jobs and therefore rebuild the economy truly thought video of as been having two and a i can make an educated guess that all heterosexual men have bragged about their exploits with women to another man at some point believe in equality between the sexes i have the right and capability to make my own and live the life i choose for myself because i am a feminist i know and exercised my right not to be put in a box or voting group and to freely think and make my own judgment as to who i thought would be the best candidate for president it is a mistake to believe a feminist must support someone because of their anatomy and not their actions a feminist does not blindly do what she is told or she thinks and makes her own choices thought the sexual allegations were unsubstantiated and therefore equivalent to and campaign mudslinging if these women had truly been assaulted why wait until one month before the election to come forward to the press not the authorities thought it incredibly hypocritical to him as a sexual predator when we know for a fact that bill is and helped him cover it up through libel and slander of the women who did come forward this change my opinion about except for maybe a more sympathetic attitude and feeling that the media was treating him gender has no bearing whatsoever in their qualifications for a including the presidency was not clear as to what her policies as president would except to maybe continue with the same failed practices her policies would not have helped our depressed and stagnant economy i believe plans for job creation benefits including minority groups i also and have for a long to a more isolationist foreign not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or trump voter a mother of two boys who is currently not calls herself a feminist most but she is fiercely opposed to voting for someone based on gender alone instead she backed who shares her own beliefs including not raising taxes her home state of a mix of farmland and more white and less educated than the national mean voted for trump some things i would be a feminist but it mean i vote for someone because she has a vagina always voted republican and always support the party they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality the end of the day video of did not affect my support for him what he says and what he does matter in those senses because looking for somebody that has the same beliefs as i do in running a country at the end of the day all sinners and we all say things like this it uncommon we act like the president of united states should be some holy person can go through all the us presidents and you will see sexual dysfunctions in all of their personal even husband had an affair at the end of the my sex life does not involve his work life and my sex life does not involve my life these women that came out about trump could have been hoping for media or maybe just simply paid by to make her criminal issues look not going to vote for somebody because of their gender or race there is nothing other than whether they can run the country or a which naturally lends itself to traditional twitter republican nominee was knocked out of the presidential heather brown backed trump brown believes that under trump the us economy will prosper and the average will be able to succeed in areas where they are currently home work and finance she says that trump the misogynist reported to really just felt like they pushed a female candidate through to break the glass ceiling of a perceived gender equality bias politics can be unscrupulous it demands you constantly remember that behind every door lives a pushed agenda

opposition and attacks the like of which no other candidate has ever faced and still win the popular vote to defeat her it took an unholy cabal far beyond what faced when he was the campaign of swimming with the tide of disgust about the bush administration as the new times the time all the ballots are she seems likely to be ahead by more than votes and more than percentage points she will have won by a wider percentage margin than not only gore in but also in and john f in twitter concession know can flip that and see that trump was such a weak candidate it took decades of scheming and an extraordinary international roster of powerful players to lay the groundwork that made his election possible defeating in the electoral college took the gutting of the voting rights act by republican appointees to the supreme court it took vast republican voter suppression laws and tactics set in place over many years it took voter intimidation at many polling places it took the long republican campaign to blow up the boring bureaucratic irregularity of use of a private email server into a scandal that the media obediently picked up and reheated us yet to join ranks of countries with female leaders read took the director of the using that and his power to stage a misleading smear attack on days before the election in flagrant violation of the custom of avoiding such intervention for days before an election it took a compliant mainstream media running after his sabotage like a golden retriever chasing a tennis ball it took decades of conservative attacks on the

him on charges related to completely unrelated sexual activities during his second took a nearly reality the that deified racism and narcissism as essential to success and power as the feminist media critic points trump said and did was framed in a way to flatter and more flatter his the colossal infomercial fictionalized the cheating businessman as an unqualified success and gave him a kind of brand recognition no other candidate had it took the full support of fox whose roger was so committed to him that after leaving the company following allegations of decades of sexual harassment of he joined the trump campaign it took the withdrawal of too many from even that of journalism into the partisan unreliability of sites and bubbles of social took the mainstream of failure to address climate change as the most important issue of our time it took decades of most media outlets letting the propaganda arm create the false framework of two equally valid opinions rather than reporting the overwhelming scientific consensus and tremendous danger of climate change to stop it also took using as a tool of evidently considering his grudge against the democratic nominee important enough to try to aid the campaign of a racist authoritarian now appears to have so close a relationship with that he often appears on the channel and news site rt he tweeted protests when president information was included in the panama papers hack and has been coy about where his leaked information on the democratic national committee came intelligence experts say it came from and made it clear that he favored win the day dropped his the new times ran a story reassuringly titled investigating sees no clear link to with its own underplayed revelation buried the officials have become increasingly based on the evidence they have that direct goal is not to support the election of as many democrats have but rather to disrupt the integrity of the political system and undermine standing in the world more beef over loss is with liberal young and old read it took a shortsighted campaign of hatred on the an almost hysterical rage like nothing i have ever seen before about any public figure some uncritically picked up outright and spin to feed their hate and rejected anything that diluted the purity and focus of that including larger questions about the other candidate and the fate of the earth it was so extreme that in recent i was attacked for posting news stories on social media by furious people who took the position that to be overtly was to be covertly if the perfect is the enemy of the whose friend is the greater of two a lot of people seemed to think the primary ended the night trump was elected i saw that from climate and others who you might expect would have turned to face the clear and present danger of a trump presidency i for much about failure to address the pipeline adequately which was and but overshadowed by what we heard so little million dollars or so invested in the pipeline and the guarantee he would use presidential powers to push it and every pipeline like it through impossible to disconnect the irrational emotionality from and the misogyny continues since election been hearing too many men of the left go on and on about how was a weak candidate wondered about that word not only because it is so often associated with but because what calling her weakness was their refusal to support her as if sent a pink lifeboat and we sent it because we wanted a blue and now we are very upset that people are as my brilliant friend put it some point soon we need to discuss whether sanders would have been able to but helpful it just sounds like democrats should have cut into lead in the misogynist
as of the nation reels in the wake of the election of people around the world are struggling to figure out next as protesters take to the climate scientists issue dire and immigrants face down fears of some people are wondering whether the states will truly ever be united many in the us and around the world fear the taking to bed and streaming while drinking wine a particularly effective way forward for the country for guidance on how to move past and we asked those best equipped at knowing how to laugh in the face of pain and comedians having a twitter while i am not sold on the term i am still going to use it i am going to my sense of social responsibility and remember that everyone has their own unique and to have compassion before vitriol i am not but if i may their term for merely this i may decide this is the time for my global time to finally see or live in a have to move forward no matter what because that is the nature of political cycles i think in our best interest to process all our emotions as they come and then remember that positive change just happen every four it happens all the time and this a just a roadblock and evolution are as vital a part of democracy as compromise and precedent for i will be replaying clips from the simply to exist in a bubbling hot tub of denial once i move past probably download seven more guided meditation and commit to more flax in my diet inevitably going to be bumpy so might as well keep both ends of my body on have to get back out twitter i have little wisdom to share today it feels dark scared what i do know is that i have a voice and a platform and so many others whose lives will be affected by this election do not though today is a i have to get back out there i chose my job because i wanted to make the world a safer place and starting tomorrow allowing myself a i will get back to work when you are join fall for the same old twitter the only answer i have is for me to get back to work i tell anyone else how to deal with it not black or gay or a woman and i know the fear in their hearts after something like this i can read all the articles about how poor whites who voted him in because in ravaged rural communities and they see any change in the last eight years so they were going to vote republican no matter about holding the media and news companies accountable for reporting on how about fuck the democrats in the first place for every swaying the nomination away from my answer for getting over all maybe fall for the same old shit news outlets can go to can we laugh we because we always will i laughed at jokes about on be fine comedy is indestructible you destroy it just like a war on terror you destroy a concept or a feeling send this to them look how righteous i am i have to go tell jokes in times fucking square tonight back to for those who have a twitter i think being about the situation is the first step totally understandable to feel dread right but more important to not let that dread incapacitate you occupy your mind with being vigilant of the oppression around you it has become so easy to justify oppression in our and we need to be ready to stand for those who have much of a voice right now there are a lot of citizens nervous and scared right now i feel like helping in whatever way you can to and strengthen will also help yourself to cope trying to find ways that make it easier for us all to listen to each other is a fantastic endeavor right way to move forward that i am personally trying is to inject more logical thinking into my comedy material it seems as a country right we are leaning more on emotional response and less on logic to make our decisions comedy is great because it can help condition people to think more critically about things without it coming off as forced comedy can disarm and open people up to new ways of thinking rock and his for seem like there are any easy answers to fixing all this right but weed is more legal now so roll a grab your and look to the must be twitter comedians are surviving this election the way everyone else only a little bit easier get me this quite the most disastrous thing that has happened to me in my entire life my anxiety is so bad physically incapable of being depressed i got up and took a hike this morning who am it because i wanted to feel good it was because i literally wanted to stomp on something as hard as i could and i decided the thing i was going to stomp on was planet earth i would die to change this outcome if i could truly i have no unfinished business on this planet been on had some great i did i saw the that being of all the feelings had today despair one thing not feeling is block not a silver just a fact i take for granted that in this i am luckier than the other people living through this nightmare i get to make jokes and pound my fist and get and because a comedian and because a person who was born in this not much of a chance this presidency will affect me even with even a fraction of the force with which going to devastate everyone else i have no advice i know we need to
another big week for me and my cancer they but so and things are really hotting up before the us election got a good show managed to persuade piers as one of the few journalists who actually knows trump to speak to us from his car while filming in for and really interesting about what the media have understood about the piers is also one of the people from the worlds of journalism and broadcasting many of whom if honest i really claim to know especially well come forward to make my life easier they know this or by offering good wishes and positive thoughts and if my experience is anything to go if you know anyone with a cancer diagnosis hesitate just drop them a line to let them know thinking of them genuinely appreciated show went i but still suffering from occasionally quite acute fatigue i blame the as i get anything like this in the course of seven cycles of also since the really only able to sleep on my back my kingdom for a pair of can i hear despairing partners the doctors reckon this might be because of the impact of the radiotherapy on my which been by the well with the malarkey except that at around five on morning i get the first signs of an unmistakable and potentially very painful condition kidney i was first diagnosed with them more than years ago and every now and again since a new one would get stuck in my kidney and kick off a bout of the name given to the excruciating pain that can come with them this time a couple of painkillers see it off but stand if you can face for what happened a few days first day on the new treatment and one having to pay and my first visit to what one of the nurses laughingly described as otherwise known as the patients medical day so at there i am being shown into the discreetly hidden from the regular day unit be visiting later for my infusion and guess it looked very similar to its and while on the subject of business the seats were actually staff were of and i got my first dose of the very expensive plus per which the currently treatment was first class as previously no problem with the principle that i should pay for as the should be protected from additional unfunded treatment costs i choose to avail myself of but i still struggle with the royal taking a markup simply to supply an already very expensive drug by the is already standard treatment as part of chemotherapy for my cancer in the us and charging a private day rate as a whole day for a treatment that takes just over an hour taken to calling it my very own for scandal i hope putting the money to good which is perhaps something worth looking having received my i was escorted back downstairs to rejoin the rest of the human race in the and do you aside from having identical seats to i think there might actually be more space down but time to get reacquainted with the as its name is a rubber cap attached to a refrigeration system that rapidly cools the thus reducing the risk of hair loss that some chemotherapy drugs otherwise more or less guarantee it work for but it really worked for me over seven cycles of to be a few quizzical looks from other patients more used to seeing women using it and the endurance test that is the first minutes of wearing it as it literally freezes your scalp brain freeze and multiply by was a very small price to pay of course forgotten how hard it would be and very nearly took it off but in the end the name of the new machines they now have at the and a from the staff got me though it so i still have hair on my would turn out to be one of the most difficult since i was diagnosed back in march and none of it to do with my cancer or its metastases directly for a i have been suffering with constipation of cancer patients once it gets to or days as it has for me can become almost painfully uncomfortable then there was the discomfort under my right ribs put down to my liver playing up more another hangover from the radiotherapy and to cap it all was the recurring renal colic from my kidney stones and their appalling sense of timing and the twist the painkillers a mixture of paracetamol and codeine tend to work less effectively over time make you more cut a long story was a bit of a perfect in increasing discomfort and waiting until enough time had elapsed to allow me to take more painkillers which no longer quite do the and make the worse as a i leave the house and have no desire to eat or drink and the latter set to provide the biggest twist of all at for blood tests preparatory to the next dose of new due by after such a dreadful i can add extreme fatigue to my list of ailments dress and have to sit slightly for a rest blood tests show sharply declining level of which means no for me unless they recover doctor also spots that my blood pressure is pretty low and i get when standing up and so prescribes intravenous fluids to at looking forward to radio today same thing happens extreme fatigue and dizzy when i stand up decide might not be possible the by the have been nothing but support itself over the course of my cancer travails return to hospital for more iv fluids i think these are probably the consequences of the radiotherapy taking my appetite for and drink and my simply not drinking enough for far too to to see whether platelet levels
in when the gender identity development service at clinic it received two referrals in its first year of operation as current director of the it was considered a option for a clinical psychologist to in the field of gender identity in young people there enough patients that is not how it has turned out last children under were referred to double the number the year before of these nearly were under the age of with some as young as three years reasons for this exponential increase are obviously complex one factor seems to be a huge shift in awareness of individuals in wider culture the attention paid to in and a carter playing a role in the historic tragedy of the story told in and the many public controversies about respect for trans rights have all informed this awareness it is never just a phase if these kids do go through self has helped to open up a space for greater acceptance and particularly in but also for highly emotive and debate about how best to help young people who believe they need to transition at the sharpest end of this debate are the parents whose children are identifying themselves as well before and sometimes living outwardly as the other sex these children and their parents are more aware than ever that there are choices available to them to correct what they believe to be the error in their bodies it can seem these choices are the ultimate but the decisions parents have to make about intervening in their biology are anything but couple of weeks ago i sat in on a conference by a charitable support group for parents of children who identify as trans the charity has been much in the news in recent in part because it has featured in the widely reported custody battle heard at the high court that involved a boy of seven allowed to live as a because his mother had become convinced those were his wishes the judge in the justice ruled that the boy should live with his and that the mother caused significant emotional harm to her son in her active determination that he should be a mermaids had supported the mother in her belief that her son identified as for two years and described the ruling as a injustice and which had been for the another case it was reported that a family was taking legal action against a local authority for backing their adoption of a name as a step towards changing her gender the mother of the girl said she believed her daughter was too young to make her own decision rights of parents in the are being she those who have traditional values it is leaving parents to feel vulnerable and twitter aged started asking his mum questions about gender at the age of six at s management digital art bell s went along to the mermaids conference in part to try to make sense of some of these issues for myself it seems to me unquestionably a wonderful thing that young people faced with some of the trauma of these feelings about who they are can find tolerant space in which to experiment with different expressions of their gender and be protected in law from discrimination but as a i find it hard to get rid of the feeling that the more choices you give to younger the more they are likely to adopt them for a variety of psychological reasons is a or an or a or a really able to make informed enough decisions about the consequences of a complete shift in their gender involving deed poll name change and living are we formed in our gender identities before puberty or by and can the psychological consequences of these decisions possibly be mermaids conference was addressed by a endocrinologist at the hospital in and the guiding light of the charity is an evangelist for what some parents of children see as a revolution in the medical treatment of their kids he sees gender through the lens of his own specialism hormones and has devoted his working life to having other people view this question in the same way he dislikes the term reassign a he just acknowledge what it really is and fix at one point in his led his audience in an impromptu rendition of times they are in of bob prize but also to highlight the generational shift in attitudes toward gender identity that we are congressmen please heed the a battle outside these kids are desperate they have a bath or shower and that of most of his the times are not changing nearly fast enough for some children is a advocate for early medical intervention in gender identity cases he proposes following the model inspired by clinics in the in which children identifying as are routinely given drugs after the onset of and then move on to high doses of hormones to change their and then later perhaps consider surgery the most controversial part of this protocol is the age at which children are given the the effects of which can be irreversible and may lead to a loss of fertility the guidelines currently state that no children be given this hormone treatment until they are around sees the age as and often cruel he an arena of enormous this kind of certainty is seductive looking around the room at the attended by many parents faced with these you can sense heartfelt relief among some that there is an to their anxieties as someone not faced with these that relief seems open to the supplementary question of how a parent or child can honestly be certain this is what they want before the child has reached has no doubts genuine gender is easily he believes it is never just a or a box kids miss an opportunity to is who i he argues have a fantasy that they are
trump has promised to build a wall along the border between the us and after his electoral triumph over many are wondering whether actually pull this or any of his other controversial along with many other minorities in the were railed against by trump during his campaign in the to the he vowed to rid the us of yet despite this adding to his record of xenophobic trump was elected the president of the united states mapping the trump countries and regions feeling the heat read real estate billionaire promised to scrap the north free trade agreement on grounds that it at the expense of us workers he has also threatened to tax the money sent home from the us by migrants to in for the aforementioned spoke to in the us and about the election of and how they think his presidency might affect their lives what they underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on feel dismayed and deeply disappointed as bad as that the worst part is feeling powerless we have a say in an event that can have catastrophic consequences to our economy in the us we are seen as collateral damage even those opposing trump seem indifferent to the economic and human pain this situation can inflict on us i understand the economic pain that people in the rust belt are feeling successful trade agreements transfer some jobs from one country to another but are net job creators to all involved countries under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt north gained and the south has but this is the result of failed compensating measures within both countries boosted wealth across the subcontinent cutting ties with will also harm the us it surprises me that during the campaign no one pointed this out and perceive that trade is a game under the us gained jobs in the south at the expense of the rust belt it surprises me this was pointed as trump adopts a pragmatic the damage can be limited to a further decline in my purchasing power owing to the peso devaluation and a difficult business environment while expectations are better anchored if he feels obligated to deliver on the promises made to his voters and revokes things could be much worse our government has little leverage because underestimate the consequences that damaging our economic ties can have on them they are self absorbed and busy inflicting pain on one another of will probably send us into an even deeper power trump has over over our over our our perception of our freedom of over the way the world will see us is terrifying and he is not even the president we woke up to find the exchange rate at pesos for the dollar we went from per dollar on election to yesterday and today expected to reach by the end of the year we have been humiliated in front of the deportations of many who live and work in the united who send money home and who contribute tremendously in that way to our economy will probably send us into an even deeper recession his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever see we surprised how many love adore are more than willing to welcome in any who wishes to make their home for the next four bring your come live bring your help us out we are a welcoming country with amazing fantastic great cities with interesting museums and landmarks and restaurants and we hope they will seriously consider it that goes for people who want to escape the our collective the democracy was something to aspire to the spell has been broken in many ways in even the least educated among us believe this man to be a buffoon his ideas are uninspired and poorly that his misogyny is worse than any machismo we have ever seen we are surprised by how much and how many love adore are now wondering where to turn to for inspiration and what way of life and ideology will now inspire this we ask has created a dangerous stereotype of in the have a visa and i can travel throughout the us whenever i which is a lot but i am concerned of the increase of hate or that as a result of the stereotype i live in a place visited by a lot of tourists i worry that they will think that i am or that they think i am a drug dealer or a is not fair that a presidential candidate has blamed because of issues they have he has created a dangerous stereotype of in the us there are a lot of undocumented but a lot of us are living legally in the us many drugs go the us through the but what they forget is the us is the first drug consumer worldwide what they say is that they are in part responsible for the drug cartel violence in some we make jokes about it we now say that we are no longer the country with the stupidest president in the world silver lining is that perceives trump as a common politics in can find common ground to make front to his politics and maybe force the common efforts by different parties before the presidential election i really hope margarita will engage in alliances with other parties to win the will suffer irremediably if trump imposes tariffs on imports renegotiating for example or tax the remittances the fiscal situation in is already strained owing to low oil prices and corrupt politicians with vast regions of the country in hands of or crime trump adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt politicians like president and the foreign trumps adds chaos to the already dismal state of government with inept and corrupt are going to inflation and currency devaluation will spike making expenses more

trump the family plead for the white house to save him the drama is dominating the news networks a media storm what will trump nobody has a clue trump lacks military experience he has never served in the armed forces nor does he have any background in diplomacy what trump does by all is a short fuse a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later his predecessors would have played for appealed to local or pursued talks while examining options for a president trump is different unused to the awesome responsibility of the oval under fierce pressure to enraged by personal infuriated by accusations of and determined not to show it is easy to imagine trump making a hasty and disastrous call with a few translated into trump could not only lose the he could plunge the us inextricably into the quagmire of another middle east war there are grave doubts about trump volatile temperament and macho doubts about volatile temperament and macho instincts also apply in other global where a

is not wholly imaginary in last a royal air force was captured and burned to death in a cage by the after negotiations for his release failed similar repeat incidents involving and members of the and local are becoming more likely as the endgame in the fight against the caliphate battle is being fought out on two main fronts one is the siege of northern principal city trump has the conduct of the which involves the mainly and militias backed by us special forces commandos but he has not offered an alternative the same holds true of the attempt to seize the headquarters in in northern trump says that defeating terrorism is a top priority and he will the shit out of but including appears to know what this means in practice if the battle goes will he will he cities where millions of civilians is he prepared to deploy us ground what will he do as seems both sieges become bogged or begins daily executions of is also silent about significant military intervention in and and its parallel fight with the president wants two things from an end to us support for the and the extradition of a cleric exiled in the us who he blames for last failed coup with on the back foot and the

rupture with but a reset will come with a price in the first authoritarian will want a relaxation or scrapping of punitive sanctions imposed after annexed in to dismay in trump has suggested he may also seems likely to get his way in where forces have pushed his to the brink of victory in and elsewhere trump has made no serious objection to actions in even though the says they may constitute war crimes he seems content to have remain in or even to treat him as an the renewed use of chemical for new or a suddenly escalating humanitarian and refugee catastrophe could all trigger a new crisis that blows up in forcing him to move against the idea of zones and civilian safe havens still has backers if trump goes down this he could end up directly confronting allies cannot do much about insouciance but they will strongly oppose him if he tries to run down the as he has suggested pressure on easternmost members in the and in terms of political missile deployments and military exercises is reaching new heights and operations are increasingly reported in and elsewhere in the eastern remains a ticking any of these could ignite at any time in first governments want to present a united front but trump seems more interested in buying off by acquiescing in reclamation of former cold war spheres of influence disdain for the he loudly applauded vote to leave and critical reaction to his notably in and point to a possible schism down the road if it trump will have helped achieve a strategic shattering years of shows no sign of backing away from its expansionist

nationalist feeling in china is periodically whipped up by the communist party if trump blunders into this delicate or deliberately tries to push the the fallout could be terms of as a trap for an

for the us and have underwritten the open global trading partly because of a stubborn and correct belief in the merits of free partly out of as beneficiaries of and partly it spreads peace and have spearheaded successive rounds of tariff cuts and multilateral trade deals and stood the general agreement on tariffs and trade and its the world trade to keep the system honest they have cut regional trade promoted the single market above kept their markets open despite other notably gaming the system for their own narrow consensus in both countries was that the wider gains transcended any pain no longer the voting for the first trump have consigned all that to history and the unintended consequence of will mean the same for the system that underpinned our collective prosperity is about to be brought national and international including an avalanche of inward direct investment into both powerful international financial and business service rising global living standards and the economic and democratic transformation of but both manufacturing sectors have taken disproportionately heavy hits drive round the ailing industrial towns of south or and compare the economic and social landscape with that of shanghai or decade of consistent manufacturing trade deficits have exacted a cruel voters across and rotting industrial heartlands delivered their verdict no more plants moving abroad no more closures because of cheap imports no more sales of great companies to foreigners no more stagnating wages no more immigration it may be that there are jobs and great prospects aplenty in the burgeoning tech and service sectors in the big cities driven by global but they care they are hurting and nobody has taken decisive action to help them the votes for trump and mark the end of an era and a new dark age of protectionism and will insist that this is a travesty of their they want to access more global trade and not be they crazily by the confines of the union and its bureaucratic inability to cut aggressive trade deals with the rest of the world they live in a dreamland if they feel that the rest of the world is more committed to free trade than while membership did not hold back from being among the major any apart from the promised closure of borders to that is not what their voters as always better understood than any of his allies he cordially despises voters in south and the west midlands want the same as their counterparts in and after it was those three with their tiny vote which gave trump the electoral college votes for victory he might be a but he or at least styles a workers benefit from free trade and as he has consistently said for in the teeth of opposition from the republican mainstream who remain free traders his as he called wants to stop both exchange and intermingling are the lifeblood of that along the border was one of the most insistent chants at his along with the forced deportation of million illegal immigrants but more importantly for the international trading trump wants to withdraw from the north free trade agreement between the and which he casually dismisses as the trade deal in he also wants an immediate halt in negotiations for both the transatlantic and trade agreements and unilaterally he wants to impose swingeing against the rules of the world trade from which he is prepared to on which account for half of the trade deficit per cent tariffs are promised on imports the remaining agreements the us has signed are to be reviewed or abrogated the impact would be killing by exposing the already enfeebled as inciting and trade retaliation and the entire global system of trade and say that trump the president will be much more cautious and realist than trump the his talk on trade should be seen as threats to produce more fairly balanced not a tearing up of the world system maybe but there cannot be a complete divorce between campaign rhetoric and policy he believes what he says and nobody in his close coterie is going to urge caution not his senior trade who has promised a potential in the first six months of the trump from every major us trade deal if it cannot be shown actively to benefit the us era of trade deficits is he says will but otherwise we put tariffs has said trump will go to ground on every trade such as the one with south that the described as and wants to revoke trump has already given a commitment that on day one he will declare china a currency manipulator as a precursor to introducing up to tariffs on positions are not they represent a deeply held view that the us does not need trade except on terms that put first the idea that successive administrations have negotiated deals loaded in the us interest is impossible to concede because how else would he explain the rust there can be no concession that jobs are disappearing with or without trade because of and automation the of the and has disappeared for ever and destroying the international trading system is not going to bring it of that cuts any ice with a demagogic populist trump has promises to keep to a that expects no less the last time a republican president and his party controlled both the house of representatives and senate with the same convictions on first trade was there were warnings that introducing the tariffs on imports in would trigger a but first republicans could not help themselves and the democrats were too weak to stop institute for international economics in predicts that if trump raises tariffs on china and and they then us growth will

it is no use pretending presidential election victory is a disaster for the united states and the world it at least in a victory for prejudice and for ignorance and spite it represents the triumph of economic nationalism and introspection over internationalism and the global good it is a victory built on fabrications because of will ultimately confounded by its contradictions and its immorality it will be defeated but correcting this deformation will not be easy it will take time and the damage will be explanations have been offered for defeat last week all have an element of truth for she was an uncharismatic figure the democratic base was uninspired and many stayed at home doubts surrounded her past not least in respect of the foundation in many she represented a discredited political establishment there was about her candidacy an sense of entitlement there was her ambiguous legacy and was a reaching up to a place of power no woman has ever gone a mostly unspoken misogyny undoubtedly played a part in her the complacency of the democratic party and liberal too comfortable after eight safe years of did a great disservice the party and its elected representatives badly misread the mood of the nation for the most did independent pollsters and the us media they initially dismissed trump as a clown and then with to give him too easy a these factors contributed to demise but they are not the whole story trump won because he successfully tapped the alienation and disillusionment of white men and women who comprise of the electorate and turned out for him in large numbers as polling breakdowns the determining factors were not education or not religion or not sexual predations or entanglements they were race and linked to economic distress trump exploited a feeling among whites from all suburban and that inclusive and was not working for were significant numbers of people who felt their grievances were no longer being listened to by a centrist party that had loosed itself from its moorings as frank said in these pages last democrats went from being the party of town in to the party of vineyard of the and they did so at roughly the same time that the republicans were sharpening their deadly image of the of the constituency that switched to trump was railing against a sense of being overlooked during eight years of president race unquestionably played a part when trump shrieked his slogan great what he was really saying was white when he spoke about curbing immigration and building a when he minorities and people from foreign countries he does not know or when he vowed to scrap international trade deals that he claims are destroying jobs in the when he railed against selfish allies who do not pay their the subliminal message was always the fear of the foreigner in conjured the illusion of a return to a society of secure safe and agreed values no wonder and other minorities are frightened no wonder us relations around the globe are in turmoil and populists and hard are celebrating no wonder observers speak of the end of the west and the demise of liberal democracy has stormed the shining city on a betrayed the founding fathers who stood tall for human dignity and universal rights and now presages an isolationist made in image a beacon of discrimination and are the peculiarities of the electoral system to too won a majority of the popular vote but was handsomely beaten in the race for electoral college votes and too little attention was paid to the effect of a decision by the supreme court in when it struck down a key part of the voting rights act of by a five to four vote what this did was allow nine states with long records of voting such as south to no longer seek federal approval to change their laws the effect was seen last week as the what has been happening in north a battleground state with a history of racial discrimination in voting republican lawmakers and officials have gone to remarkable lengths to drive down turnout among black who disproportionately there were numerous other examples across the including stringent voter id rules that the federal government had stated earlier this year had a disproportionate effect on minorities for the leader of the free world to allow voter suppression is beyond supporters and opponents alike are about to discover is that like the billionaire is much of what he promised on the campaign trail will not be delivered or will be so watered down as to make no says he will cut raise public spending and slash the federal deficit impossible all at once trump says he will renegotiate or scrap and other treaties but his conceit that this will help uncompetitive in or in is says he will slap swingeing tariffs on but he knows the geopolitical and commercial realities mean he will not he says he will make strong and its then kowtows to the most formidable strategic and undermines he says he will be best friend but his campaign was not above antisemitic trump voters really believe the border wall they need a reality check the power of us presidents to act unilaterally in or any other domestic is extremely circumscribed trump would face endless legal challenges and he would need agreement and funding from prospect that much of what trump has promised or threatened will not happen is welcome perhaps the responsibilities of office will temper his worst producing a the incoherence and contradictory nature of his economic ideas for boosting growth and jobs and moribund industrial areas suggest his grassroots supporters are destined for disappointment economic performance is what will ultimately define the trump has plenty of other horrors in while volatile personality and inexperience add extreme at home and to a host of other worries trump now has the opportunity to stack the supreme court with conservative reactionaries
for has toyed with the idea of a woman becoming president this for an all too brief it looked as if the idea might become a reality but the dream of a female president has remained just a disingenuous myth occasionally serves up in but never permits to spill into its facts instead of witnessing the landmark moment of a woman moving into the oval we can now see the misogyny that became a feature of the presidential campaign bedding down in the corridors of power when trump called a in the final only a few days after a series of recordings revealed him admitting to a series of sexual aggressions and many people thought it was the end of his bid for the presidency social media during election night revealed trump supporters male and female voicing the view that a woman is simply not capable of being too weak to stand up to foreign leaders and the sucker punch for those of us who believe that this particular woman was spectacularly more ready for the white house than her grossly and abusive opponent is that as has historically been the case once a female candidate did not carry even the female vote a staggering of white women voted against and for the man whose statements and attitudes brought kicking and into the light twitter concession speech in conceded the she tried to offer hope to the especially the young of know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass but i know someday someone and hopefully sooner than we might think right of we may not think that right because right now the media is focusing its attention on economic and racial it is not interested in the of but that is also the story of this which was fought over a series of myths and outright two solid the media engaged in spreading and misinformation about the first serious female candidate for president for a few days after we learned that trump likes to grab women the the mainstream media began admitting how many of the derogatory stories swirling around were how many were literally fictions but then the and the story reverted to its misogynistic relentlessly informing the electorate that is untrustworthy it was character and it who still believes these claims are factual and on the some million people do should consider how closely they resemble the stories that have always been told about female both real and fictional to do so is to that it is time to stop as some commentators are that failed us the truth we failed understand a you must know its stories taking a hard look at some of the tales told about the idea of a female president can teach us a great deal about this as well as those to come the women who have become presidents in the history of fiction are not quite as vanishingly scarce as they are in but not exactly numerous until very the fictions were as presumptively white as the candidates just women have mounted a serious bid for us three of whom made it to a major national although only one secured that nomination five became third party and two became major party running both of whom lost we have had three female secretaries of one female speaker of the house but no woman has ever been elected to the executive branch of the idea of a woman in the white house has always prompted the same it is either a a disaster or a cheat was endlessly called to shouts of her although her crimes always varied had she murdered or had she covered up wrongdoing in the deaths of at stolen or was in it matter what mattered was the idea of illegitimacy most stories imagine a female president who murders or sleeps her way into or inherits the fictions about women becoming president have always worked to invalidate the very idea for the novel by a former speaker of the house and avowed enemy of newt which tells of a woman who becomes first woman president and chooses politics over national resulting in a style its now has been tipped for a cabinet because propaganda neither history nor fiction are there more than a handful of stories that imagine a female president who could ascend to the highest office in the land through merit and hard instead she either murders or sleeps her way into or she inherits the from a man fictional depictions of a female presidential candidate on the actual campaign trail are even this may correlate with the fact as herself she was always more popular in office than while running when female presidents are they are in office thanks to a of some which is also power was handed to or she inveigled her way into it either crooked just like fiction is a club into which women presidents admitted they are segregated by cropping up primarily in satire or science female presidents are a or exist in an alternate reality women are disproportionately more likely to become president in disaster movies and because only when large segments of the human race are eradicated do we imagine women in charge in early science fiction the apocalypse often took the form of the nullification of as real political gains sent masculinity into an imaginary crisis from which it has not the any writing that considered the possibility of a woman president focused not on what it would mean to but on what it would mean to men even when written by a woman what seems to be the earliest fictional depiction of a female presidential candidate was a burlesque provoked by the first woman who ran in beecher published narrated by a man who thinks he supports rights until he meets who wants to be president her name your says it she is aggressive and a unwomanly amphibious loud and vulgar by no
world leaders have begun congratulating trump on his election win as people around the world anxiously wait to see how their country will engage with the new us president the order in which trump spoke to leaders around the world has sparked speculation as to how he will shape his foreign policy in the hours after his victory trump spoke to and south the may was on the action planned after second night of protests across us read was the first to have a conversation on how to closer diplomatic with the us prime discussed regional security and how to defeat a key promise in election campaign but although the and the offered they his leadership a of asked people around the world to tell us what the situation looks like from where they how their governments are responding to victory and how they think his leadership will affect their and the us will probably grow closer but as citizens we will suffer from endorsement of our live in a police state where activists and journalists disappear or are jailed the administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of but i doubt administration will do the same this is evident from our current eagerness to connect with trump i hope he hires a team that understands the complexities of the middle east it is evident he does have a and trump are heavily disliked in the middle east by and while trump is openly hostile to and clueless about the policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her more tolerant and inclusive gone through a very similar election scenario in in where both candidates were i was not very surprised by the outcome the democratic party underestimated popularity and the dislike for i feel a lot of votes went to trump out of spite for perhaps if a different candidate had gone against trump the outcome would have been different just like what happened in it looks like the population is now sharply split in with each side the other i think the most dangerous thing that can happen to a intolerant people in power might make it easier to challenge them as they are now out in the but healing the rifts in society is much harder i simply hope trump will become a president for all us as is his and reign in the hateful extremist tendencies displayed by white hope he hires a competent team that understands the complexities of the situation in the middle east and as it is evident that he does not have a trade conflicts but he will use his business wisdom to deal with feel great about the result a tremendous win for the for those who were constantly ignored by political elites in i like trump a lot because he knew the real problems of the country rather than just chanting politically correct us is divided probably more divided than when i worked there for three years that happens when you are obsessed with gay rights and minority rights but forget to promote the most basic right of living a better life for the majority he will be a great president if he improve some of his to plot and the are now dead trump is likely to be a more pragmatic figure than so relations will improve going to be some trade conflicts if trump lives up to his word about but i believe he will use his business wisdom to deal with it china will have an easier situation and a stronger influence in the region a cooperation between these two countries could benefit humankind i wish that trump could be more presidential he will be a great president if he improves some of his rhetoric i hope that he can get along with have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from say the result was shocking would be an understatement victory of an fanatic like in a country known around the world for its liberal virtues and is something that adds to the swerve of the world to the right he adds on to the list of politicians such as in in and of in maybe we are witnessing the gradual transition of the world into a global we have a lot of supporters for trump mostly from parties another moment of jubilation for them maybe the consequences for foreign policy will be beneficial as trump has publicly shown his admiration for and his way of governance but his temperamental nature makes trump truly so we will have to wait and see as long as he turn rhetoric into i think the world will be southern where most of the people have a similar opinion to me but in the northern areas of the stomping ground of the ruling opinions may differ the philosophy of of a mutual peaceful which was even enshrined in our foreign policy until an ideological regime is something i firmly believe and the rise of a person like trump is a question mark on existence itself the hidden silent majority that is supposed to have created this ruckus may not be as silent as they are portrayed to be as in every other some are always bound to feel during the rule of a government they which could be for cultural or economical reasons beyond doubt this result was the result of what they call some sort of racial hate storm against the former policy on terrorism and the domestic election helped me to see what the us truly is under the pop culture disguise they have a huge rising tide of fanatics and a population desperate enough to find hope in them maybe his campaign of rhetoric and hate was a charade to reign in their support as long as he limits himself to rhetoric and dare turn rhetoric into i think the world will be
an estimated of million armed forces personnel are stationed abroad there are an estimated us service personnel dotted about the middle but the us does not release precise information on all their

military than or responded to the us election result by calling on trump to withdraw but advisers will warn him that without the backing of foreign and other military expertise the country is likely to fall to the strong stance on fighting and means he is unlikely to hand control of a country where thousands of troops died to a scarcely less group he has also expressed concerns about nuclear weapons in has repeatedly called for us allies to pay more towards their own but there is almost no cash to be had in which is already largely dependent on foreign aid for its budget and is one of the poorest nations in the world he is likely to be stuck then with the dollar bill for the us presence and support of afghan troops states are nervous about whether a trump administration would defend them in the event of a attack in trump told the new times he would not necessarily come to the aid of and unless they had first stumped up enough cash into has recently been ramping up its military exercises in the in response to what it sees as a growing threat in the us airborne unit is due to train with troops at a former soviet military base but it is unclear if such exercises will continue there is also uncertainty as to what will be policy the fear is that trump will effectively concede eastern to as a of this would give a free hand to create havoc in the raising the of subversion of democratic elections and even covert similar to the events of in east and possible impact of a trump presidency on trade is the main worry of goods and exports go to the representing of the and jobs

such as the deal struck by and the prime to limit methane emissions from the oil and gas industry trump could prove positive for the oil suffering like many from low planned keystone carrying oil from

the simply scare too many and current polling says pen would lose to backed by an and we know polls can be wrong for them to be wrong by percentage points would be extraordinary but the same factors

nuclear which was widely praised as a triumph of diplomacy that averted the risk of another war in the middle east despite his speech in march to the lobby public affairs during which he said his first priority was to the disastrous deal with it is still unclear what path trump will follow in office he has contradicted himself on the previously conceding that it would be hard to rip it up without lack of credibility among traditional allies of the us led some to think that his victory would be unlikely to cause much trouble for leaders insist that the nuclear accord is an international treaty whose fate also rests in the hands of as well as and china but knows that while trump may not be able to tear up the he can certainly stifle access to the global cosiness with makes fearful of

race and sex stoke deep responses in the years ago the great oral historian studs recounted a story told to him by a woman been molested by a relative as a child tried to tell her mother but no one would believe her yet one day when she was shopping with her mother and they spotted a black man far away on the other side of the department store the women gathered the girl close to worrying aloud about the unbridled lust that that man might toward little white girls the woman told even as a young she could see the craziness in that they could not see or hear that she was being assaulted by a member of the but instead their anxiety against the distant figure of a black man obliviously going about his have been thinking about that story quite a bit in recent as pondered the phenomenon of peculiar appeal to any but especially a particular stratum of conservative women particularly intrigued by women who worry aloud about his extreme or misogyny or careless grasp of foreign affairs yet who then say that what really drives their allegiance is of the supposedly murderous and licentious this is often expressed as a repulsion so strong like the little mother and they are willing to give uncle a pass in the face of multiple allegations of sexual breathtaking unprecedented verbal incoherence and the intensity of vitriol directed at still mystifies me to a great story reminds me that there is an affective dynamic to all an emotional narrative that may make sense in an alternate universe from which i may be functionally excluded race and sex stoke deep autonomic responses in the psyche trump began his political career more than years ago by taking out a ad in the new calling for the execution of five teenagers wrongly accused of raping and beating a young white stockbroker who became known as the central park jogger although evidence pinned the crime to another trump has never backed down from his assertion that he was us has elected its most dangerous leader we all have plenty to fear read throughout the trump has evoked old tropes of a ravaged endlessly at risk from thugs and terrorists with endorsements from the likes of the and trump has a narrative of warrior masculinity that dates back to film birth of a nation the trope of pugilistic white vigilantes fighting against lying and libertine black invaders black voters in that in order to protect the of frightened white women it seems not insignificant that trump has consistently appeared with a backdrop of attentive beautiful women who smile and wave and whom he symbolically shelters from rapists and terrorists and the bad from many of us nasty women of a certain age and is not sheltered by such cowboy chivalry in her achievements as secretary of state were slandered or obliterated in ways underwritten by suggestions of combined with horrendous and ubiquitous caricatures of the dangerously black man who stole the reins of power in a lustily union with supposedly this alternative trump

a month ago i tried to write a column proposing mean nicknames for on the basis that it would be funny to turn the tables on him for the cruel diminutives he applied to pull it off there is a darkness about trump that negates that sort of a folly so an incompetence so profound that no insult could plumb its has run one of the lousiest presidential campaigns ever in saying so i am not referring to his business practices or his vulgar remarks about women i mean this in a purely technical this man fractured his own party his convention was a fiasco he had no ground game to speak of the list of celebrities and pundits and surrogates taking his side on the campaign trail was extremely short he needlessly offended countless groups of disabled mothers of crying the bush and among others he even lost for now he is going to be president of the united states the woman we were constantly assured was the candidate of all time has lost to the least qualified candidate of all time everyone who was anyone rallied around and it make any difference the man too incompetent to insult is now going to sit in the oval whence he will hand down his verdicts on the grandees and sages of the old there is a bright side to a trump victory after there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for him and maybe he will live up to their high regard for him he has pledged to the of and maybe he will sincerely tackle that task he has promised to renegotiate and maybe will finally come to pass maybe win so much for us he once predicted in a campaign that get sick of not deceive ourselves we going to win anything what happened on is a both for liberalism and for the world as president trump goes about settling scores with his former picking fights with other and unleashing his special deportation police on this group and we will all soon have cause to regret his ascension to the presidential throne what we need to focus on now is the obvious what the hell went what species of guided our democratic leaders as they went about losing what they told us was the most important election of our at the top she has an impressive she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine twitter victory speech in was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a victory would have moved every democrat in up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary something that was taken for granted had winning been the number one several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was with his powerful plainspoken and there was an inspiring and largely figure each of them would probably have beaten but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party so democratic leaders made their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the her fondness for and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose even though they knew about her private email server they chose her even though some of those who studied the foundation suspected it was a sketchy try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a monster is to court disbelief if trump is a as liberals often democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop not a party hack chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats mean what they said about that their opportunism took precedence over the or maybe supporters among the media help either it always struck me as strange that such an unpopular candidate enjoyed such robust and unanimous endorsements from the editorial and opinion pages of the but it was the quality of the enthusiasm that really harmed her with the same arguments repeated over and two or three times a with nuance and contrary views all the act of opening the newspaper started to feel like tuning in to a cold war propaganda station what it consisted was virtually without flaws she was a peerless leader clad in saintly a a caring benefactor of women and a warrior for social scandals real the economy was doing well was already people supporting if they it was only because they were botched humans racism was the only conceivable reason for lining up with the republican candidate how did the crusade the fourth estate came together in an unprecedented professional consensus they chose insulting the other side over trying to understand what motivated them they transformed opinion writing into a vehicle for high moral boasting what could possibly have gone wrong with such an put this question in slightly more general terms and you are confronting the single great mystery of the class just spent the year rallying around a professional really all that and either insulting or silencing everyone who accept their assessment and then they lost maybe time to consider whether something about shrill shouted from a position of high social that turns people even larger problem is that there is a kind of chronic complacency that has been rotting liberalism for a hubris that tells democrats they need do nothing they need deliver nothing really to anyone except their friends on the jet and those nice people at the rest of us are treated as though we have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these democrats are the thing between us and the end of the world it is a
impartiality lies at the very heart of good journalism avoiding bias is something on which respectable media outlets pride themselves this is as robust debate is vital for a healthy media by an informed society but when the weight of scientific evidence points incontrovertibly one doggedly reporting both equally can result in misleading provided a example of this in coming in for harsh criticism in a trust report which singled out their attention to marginal on the subject of man made climate among other issues despite the overwhelming scientific evidence that human activity is driving climate the report found that several shows fell victim to an application of editorial guidelines on resulting in far too much airtime for climate change deniers a report published in concluded that this key conclusion resonates this known as false arises when journalists present opposing as being more equal than the evidence allows but when the evidence for a position is virtually it is profoundly mistaken to treat a conflicting view as equal and opposite by default with respect to man made climate the is far from the only outlet skewing their coverage in the name of and global coverage on climate science remains exceptionally with the scientific consensus part of the problem is that good science reporting requires a keen understanding of scientific method and the importance of evidence in the absence of dubious views can perpetuate in held a press claiming a link between autism and the vaccine these allegations received scant attention from dedicated science who were familiar with tropes and acutely aware of the paucity of evidence for claims activists instead targeted their stories at selling them as human interest pieces this strategy was devastatingly effective as author and academic a staggering of science stories in were with over of these pieces penned by journalists in we were getting comment and advice on complex matters of immunology and epidemiology from people who would more usually have been telling us about a funny thing that happened with the pair on the way to a dinner and writers who lacked knowledge of the requisite science fell into a default assumption that two mutually opposed views must have equal merit but the lack of evidence for such ominous claims was still rather and investigative journalist deer began to work eventually exposed financial conflicts of interest and unethical and in time claims were exposed as a wealth of data has continued to show the vaccine to be completely consequences of the needless were anything but faced with conflicting reports and unable to their respective parents opted to not vaccine their with deadly results and an resurgence of measles of this is intended to pin the blame for these deleterious consequences on journalists and media outlets but the fact that activists could exploit the ideal of impartiality is a worrying one the assumption that good journalism requires mutually opposed views to be treated as equally valid simply hold when the overwhelming weight of evidence points resolutely in one does however require a certain amount of expertise to and for media outlets discerning between valid science and pseudoscience can be a difficult task journalists are under tremendous pressure to produce engaging with tight deadlines one way of reducing false balance and poor reportage is to put scientific experts in direct contact with those covering the and such as the science media and sense about science have had considerable success in such i strongly recommend that scientists register their expertise with these groups to help stem the tide of misinformation scientific public engagement is but the question of when and how to engage is rife with complications i encountered this when an radio station asked me to discuss the documentary with its star the aforementioned the producer claimed a rival broadcaster had offered him a slot with a sympathetic host and no and that there was strong local public pressure for him to appear i grudgingly agreed to provide a with the caveat that i would be allowed articulate why giving him a platform to air discredited views was itself unethical the experience was a frustrating predictably generating more heat than is the crux of the issue with false balance no matter how noble the intention of media presenting science and pseudoscience in an adversarial format gives a false impression that an issue is scientifically contentious worse it gives free rein for dubious motivations to masquerade as scientific opinion whether the issue is or anything presenting an belief as being on equal footing with an established scientific understanding is corrosive to public understanding i asked author and broadcaster for his take on this unfortunate and in his view such media requests are as as they are situation is but i am increasingly declining interviews because it is not my job to provide false balance and thereby justify bad journalism most recently a local radio station wanted to have a jolly chat about cupping in light of its use by athletes i because the piece was inevitably going to be says it is cupping therapists says it works for some patient says it worked for hosts says that opinion is but it and a series of callers ring in with their tales of cupping miracles i want to be part of that sort of be this it is entirely possible for media outlets to cover publicly contentious topics in an informative and responsible manner the has quite admirably now given its reporters training on how to avoid false balance and present complex and contentious pointing out that science coverage does not simply lie in reflecting a wide range of views but depends on the varying degree of prominence such views should be of the disconnect is that there can be a wide gulf between the scientific consensus and public with broadcasters resorting to false balance to appease their audience but rather than default to adversarial media outlets might benefit from framing such issues in context as a discussion as

dominion over this disputed path to militancy began in another one of bloody summers back in when security forces killed protesters who was then years is said to have joined a small group of homegrown

masked and liberties protesters descended on central on guy to march near the houses of of the anonymous hacking collective wore guy masks in reference to the cult film v for vendetta young and older people marched shouting and holding banners an increased police presence and stricter rules on protest the march was largely though by there had been the majority for drug and asked attendees why they took part in the demonstration what they am protesting against the rise in feel really strongly about the situation in our country and feel that i need to do something never taken part before but i am protesting against the recent rise in xenophobia in our country and the lack of initiative to do anything about it being i am ashamed of our collective over the past few months since the vote i voted leave but i did not anticipate the wave of racism that and i am deeply disturbed and embarrassed by what now stands for and how the rest of the world views are getting stronger and more people are waking twitter protesters climb the base of column chanting are beginning to stand up against the exploitation and oppression by the people at the the global who are wealthy beyond anything we could imagine i have been to most of the marches and do so because i support anonymous and the occupy have been bought by money for and ordinary people will go along with it because of the carrot being dangled money is a huge money is we have been enslaved by money now they want to control us completely in this new world order scenario the say no enough is enough we are turning back to caring for each other and for the planet the are getting more people are waking and it is really important at this point in human history that we stand up to the tyranny of the corrupt governments that back the corporations that are destroying the planet i have always spoken to the police and had interesting discussions with them many protesters feel negative stories about violence are by the and i would tend to agree with that the police are there to do their which pay their rent and mortgages they are just like and many feel sympathy with the cause hopefully one day soon they will take off their helmets and join us i have been to all but one of these protests it is great to be with other people who feel as passionately about corruption and want to see big changes always interesting meeting lovely having fun but also feeling that we need to be doing this a drop in the ocean but this movement is not going to go away if we can get more people to wake up to what is going then have always believed in standing up to oppression and tyranny it is our duty to do so we have been fed so many lies and the media is mostly propaganda to maintain people as units of production and consumption v

corrupt media and unelected bunch of you think the civil rights movements in the us in the and were they want us to not just because of the potential violence but to block our freedoms and rights the police try this every and with about of the people there acting in a violent they feel justified last no one in the main march had any idea of this police car being blown up the march went nowhere near yard funny that there was a whole group of news reporters stood conveniently near the vehicle when it yet i probably saw about one reporter near the march for the whole evening something fishy was going on there exhilarating until you see someone throw a firework at a police horse but that was just one clearly an and he deserved to be arrested spoken to a number of police each year and some have expressed sympathy as many have had their own pensions and benefits cut the majority of them are arrogant and see themselves as better they view us as a bunch of though we are also protesting for their sake offered officers mini cheddars because they looked hungry most have turned up their noses at them but the odd one or two were really grateful i also witnessed many people being arrested for not moving behind a certain line the police had made up the officers were trying to scare everyone off by pretending to arrest this guy but all they got was abuse from the twitter protesters wore guy

vote asked about the if you look at the hate crime they did not go up substantially has been a slight rise but spoken to the police about this that happens after any national event this is nothing out of the ordinary the rise been that whittle said that hate crime had been going up anyway he the only point i would make is that in after the actually a huge amount of hate crime was more related to the terrorist attacks that were happening at the time all from me for for the comments says he would for some like killing children but it is policy to have a referendum on it if enough people call for says she is strongly opposed to one and always has and the case clinched it for says he would back the death penalty for people who kill and convicted for preying on children under the age of it

these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from john the supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their and though they seem to be there is a small possibility

the latest furore over alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater with little more than a week to go before voting unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into conduct may not be politically but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly principally by the unscrupulous republican this new stoked by republicans and it remains likely that voters will deliver a possibly rejection of trump on although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign is ahead almost everywhere that matters and

my dose of to be finding a bit more punishing than the seven cycles of chemotherapy just finished lost my more tired at the end of the and pain when i eat and drink around the main where my joins my stomach is definitely worse in fairness to the radiotherapy staff at the royal been brilliant they did say my symptoms would most likely get worse before they got better too details this is a big week for me and my cancer since the first line of chemotherapy which initially worked so reducing the cancer and the liver and lymph node metastases was shown to have failed the key question has been what to do next and aside from the radiotherapy aimed at controlling the main hopefully preventing it from further restricting the really about whether to start chemotherapy immediately or wait for some promising clinical trials due to open up in the next couple of a conundrum because the rules of eligibility for many clinical trials that any previous treatment must have ended some time before the trial starts for the i that if not careful the trial will inadvertently reflect the results of the previous treatment rather than the drug or drugs aimed at testing in the case of the trials that might be relevant to it is a requirement that any previous line of systematic chemotherapy treatment has failed and when you think about it from an ethical point of you can see why taking a patient off a treatment with a scientifically known set of costs and benefits before it has to put them on to a new unproven treatment no matter how promising would be questionable and these questions of eligibility potentially so critical to me because of the huge promise offered by some of the new treatments being trialled all boil down to timing so there you go cancer just like the rest of the question for me and my consultant now is whether my cancer especially the metastases in my liver are stable enough to allow us to wait for the trials to open or whether we need to get on with second line immediately unless it fails really quickly and hope that happen will probably rule out access to this next batch of trials which is why due for another ct scan this back at the royal for the last of daily sessions of radiotherapy thank but critically also to see my consultant the amazing starling about the results of ct scan and although the cancer spread anywhere and it looks as if the radiotherapy is working on the main i can tell you it most certainly feel like the news on my liver is not good the cancer is the says so we need to get on and treat it asap and that means a chemotherapy drug called delivered as an intravenous infusion every week for three weeks out of four and most likely no clinical trials at this stage of there are new ones coming up all the but whether be relevant to me and my and whether meet the eligibility are for now all as a fellow cancer nick has been a real source of support and invaluable the next twist in the story there is another drug called which has been shown to produce significantly better results when combined with in some patients as much as a per cent improvement in response says starling but the rub has been fully clinically trialled and for use in the and beyond and is now almost part of standard treatment for my cancer but on account of the way they measure its cost nice do not recommend it in and so the does not fund what to money were no object or i was sitting here with private health insurance by the way i what would you i ask starling she says say take without hesitation which raised the question of what it would cost if i chose to pay for it from my savings as that would be the only way i could get it first estimate from the private patient when you include fees for the treatment to be given along with the cost of the was stand by per monthly cue very sharp intake of breath from yours filming this morning for a special on cancer with my very good friend nick we first worked together on in the and then again years later at when i was editor as a fellow cancer been a real source of support and invaluable and is one of the reasons i decided to go public with my diagnosis as he has done how much i and sensing how perplexing that can might explain the huge public reaction been to my interviews with on radio back to the cost of improving my chances with my due to start this coming on further investigation where would i be without it transpires that i need as much of the drug as the private patient unit and that the stark difference between what the drug company sells it for i should say that manufacturer were most helpful and the price proposed to me by the included a understand and accept that if i choose to add an element to my then i should pay for and that the should be insulated from any of the costs but a on the and over of fees for a procedure that take much more than two not things insurance companies or visiting multimillionaires might question but a very big issue for a potential individual like me to their the have taken my questions about costs in good and so let you know how we get the real paradox lucky in that i can probably afford this drug provided

the campaign trail to open his new hotel in recently trump dolefully asked supporters whether they were glad he let you know on the evening of whether the rally at a sports complex in his third in on drew an estimated people but was far from in contrast to his swashbuckling early campaign it was overwhelmingly including many retirees but those who did attend waved and great signs and chanted her and the with the usual nodded approvingly when trump described his opponent as and jeered when trump reeled off a list of state department expenditures during tenure as including on to try to make state department pages more popular and to send three comedians to whooped with delight when the showman made reference to recent comment that he would like to take him behind the gym know what you do

his grassroots support in may trump told the new of mouth is the no thing and the word of mouth at my rallies is got to go see and you one person goes and they talk about it to a us going to quit if

how is everyone ready for i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of for women will depend on what happens in just is no overstating how important this election is not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a and setting a very particular course for the women who live here look back on this time as a watershed a moment that in shape the next hundred years of first i want to share a personal story a little over six years i was pregnant with my and when i was weeks i got incredibly ill i developed which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during was admitted to the hospital and within just a few i developed another complication called the short version being my liver was in danger of and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not had an emergency and was born weighing she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was and she was and today a wonderful healthy and i feel grateful for that every share this story because this was something in my life that changed me that shaped who i am when i think about this what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my when i think about those days in the hospital the the the the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my most pivotal it horrifies one thing i want for the next hundred i want for no to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone want for no to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government the next hundred i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her why i want to talk about this election tonight because at before in politics have bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned and a candidate who promised to choice between a person who has spent her life in public and a businessman who rips off his perhaps most making a decision between a woman who has said that rights are human and a man who says if you want you can just grab women the a feminist rallying cry right now that i like a and it pussy grabs i know that so much has been made of that and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive those of us here in this room know know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a

more activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be exactly what would happen if abortion were made in what has already happened to women like who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to trump claimed that what he said on that access tape was just and later when former new city mayor said that all men talk like men across the country came out to is not normal this is not acceptable men are better than this the feminist future that fighting for has men fighting alongside of men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted when he called women when he called women the media who can so often get things wrong took him to our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked women have been disparaged and harassed for too many and not going to take one more minute of it course this feminist future the
