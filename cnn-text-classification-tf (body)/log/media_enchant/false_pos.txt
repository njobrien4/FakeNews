being promoted to a full professor rank through a process of peer review in an exclusive interview with professor hall elaborates on how academic freedom is perceived and practiced in the has stated that genuine freedom of thought will help the country to progress in the absence of a free intellectual there can be no opportunity for growth how do you as a professor perceive reflected very on the prospects of contributing to the progress of my country when i opted in the mid to late to go to graduate school at the university of with the great as my supervisor i made a commitment to study the history of colonial relations with the first nations of my course of study took me in to my first appointment in the native studies department at the university of the university of was in those years a entity it formed the institutional seed from which the secular university would emerge in the decades prior to my appointment the next two decades i was able to work from my academic bases in and then in beginning in at the invitation of the little the chair of the department of native studies i thus moved to the province of once again i was motivated to make the transition in my professional work with the hope my i could contribute constructively to the progress of our country from an academic base in western my years as a young professor i took an active part in four first ministers conferences that took place in between and the purpose of these conferences was to negotiate a constitutional amendment to give greater definition to the the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of are hereby recognized and affirmed constitution the and the history of the mounting assault on academic freedom in universities creating an bias at a university suspension of tenured professor lacks due diligence toxic mind control contaminates the public sphere section was part of the text of the instrument facilitating the movement of authority over constitutional structure from the imperial mother country to the domestic institutions of culmination of my contributions to the formulation of a version of the constitution involved my opposition between and to what became known as the lake accord if this political deal between first ministers had become constitutional the first nations of would have been excluded from a very powerful legal definition of fundamental academic in the mainstream media and in presentations to various legislative i contributed to public awareness of the negative implications of the lake accord for supportive of existing aboriginal and treaty rights more specifically i contributed to the strength of the platform from which an parliamentarian by the name of harper used his veto power in the legislature to block the ratification of the lake accord because of harpers actions the lake accord did not become part of supreme was able to contribute to discourse crucial to the progress of until about the year between and i had to adjust my work away from the activities of the department of native studies towards a field of my own studies i prepared two academic volumes to lay the academic foundation and methodological framework for my transition to a new academic role the core focus of my emphasis on studies was indigenous peoples in encounter with colonialism globally from until the is in this context and with the encouragement of my very accomplished that i began to shift focus towards the treatment of and other peoples in the region of greater it was who also led me to my first interactions with journalists resulting in my participation in the new horizon conference of the autumn of as i have described in writing elsewhere this episode proved to make a major positive impact on to the intervention of my the activist splitting the i also began to see the events of as a major factor in the shaping of the global geopolitics in the quest for new academic turf at the has sometimes been bumpy and contested certainly many major obstacles were put in the way of my promotion to full professor eventually my academic peers were allowed to make their input into the promotion process apart from the artificial blockages thrown up by my university administration in after what i took to be my obtaining a position of intellectual and professional security as a senior faculty i resolved that henceforth i would pursue difficult lines of research and publication i made this decision with an understanding that less secure younger colleagues might eschew such a course of have made no secret of the fact that i see the recent surrender of the high ground of academic freedom by the members of the administration of the as an indicator that is on a downwards spiral it seems to me there is a move a foot to sabotage the intellectual

in the shadow of trees covering square park in downtown four of seven defendants acquitted of conspiracy in the occupation of the national wildlife refuge posed for pictures fry smiled as he flashed a peace sign he slung his arms around clutching a from the victory barbecue and a stack of newspapers with his face on them and cox stood to the far right an alternate juror named stood between them while a supporter cycled through phones to capture the moment for everyone the prosecution picture the trial ending like this said attorney for billy of the not guilty verdicts bitterly so just as quickly as the defense proclaimed a victory for rural occupation opponents dubbed the result an embarrassing loss for the prosecution and supporters of other movements and to name two wondered aloud about the meaning of justice but days and eight months the leaders of the armed occupation in eastern were found not guilty by a jury of peers questions how did it and what happens not guilty leader of the refuge occupation before was less prominent than his siblings in protesting the federal government cedar not guilty eldest of rancher children worked alongside his as a leader of the occupation the charges and five others were charged with conspiracy to impede federal employees from doing their jobs by threat or intimidation its a favorite charge of said defense attorney before the trial began when people are involved in a conspiracy they can be liable for things their did the and cox also faced weapons charges dropped those against cox and were also charged with theft of government property radio show host also faced a conspiracy charge but it was later dropped the jury found the defendants not guilty on all but one charge they failed to reach consensus on theft charge stemming from the removal of government surveillance cameras at the refuge in light of the questions swirled about whether the prosecution brought the proper charges the attorney for said prosecutors could have brought criminal trespass charges and tried the occupiers in state court but misdemeanor trespassing seem to pass for muster prosecutors wanted to bring felonies if there had been some other federal statute that specifically addresses the we would have considered using said in an interview with we have and still believe we brought the most applicable and appropriate charges under the which is our duty a watch tower at the national wildlife refuge a rancher who lives adjacent to the explained his view of the occupation in court the prosecution some described the prosecutions case as a slam dunk in a slam dunk is a show of force mike previous told griffin he thinks the prosecution brought felony charges to make a powerful statement with serious prison time their goal is to prevent any sort of activity like this in the future from the actual defendants themselves and other said prosecutors brought mounds of evidence to the table sometimes like when they brought a large display of firearms and ammunition into the courtroom and rarely did defendants dispute the facts of the case they admitted to illegally taking over a federal even to bringing their arms it bother me to be arrested because where i want to be right said on the stand like the been called by a higher power we all know this is what god called us to do but prosecutors missed the dunk and just like in a missed dunk in the courtroom can be humiliating juror no who earlier sparked a fellow jurors dismissal by questioning his impartiality wrote the saying the prosecution came off as arrogant in its case the air of triumphalism that the prosecution brought was not lost on any of the juror wrote the prosecution moved through its case quickly prosecutors rested after days they for just minutes their closing argument lasted less than two hours admitted the hurry with which prosecutors prepared their case may have hurt it he called the legal extraordinary the prosecution focused heavily on the occupiers intent behind the refuge takeover but the jury ultimately determined the prosecution failed to prove impeding federal employees was the occupiers goal even if the occupation actually did impede employees the defense hybrid delivered a thunderous closing argument on the charge all seven occupiers faced was conspiracy to impede federal employees from doing their jobs by force or intimidation i just sat through five weeks of a trial about threatening federal employees without hearing a single said in his closing argument the defense tried to make its case bigger than the bureau of land management and fish and wildlife employees in county five defendants ended up taking the speaking at length about the land and the standoff in questioned his wife on the stand fry giggled when prosecutors asked him about using government computers reveled in the glory of public testimony after decades of protesting the federal government in their closing defense attorneys attempted to instill into the jurors a sense of political responsibility were counting on you to stop government told the jury our trust is in you a jury found seven defendants charged in the occupation of the national wildlife refuge not following a trial that lasted several weeks the verdict defense attorneys expressed shock at the even they did not expect such a result it came despite scrutiny from district court judge brown and prosecutors for lack of organization defendants and their supporters erupted into tearful celebration outside the federal courthouse in downtown streamed it live just like much of the we came to to county seeking defendant said after his and today we found it but despite defendants and supporters cries of juror no wrote in his letter to the that the verdict was not an endorsement of the occupiers political beliefs it should be known that all jurors felt that this verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution to prove conspiracy in the count

throwing his reins to his the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap swirling off his operatic disappeared into the headquarters reading this story once again for the first time in i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like and he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse my early connections to modernism and my later connections to that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on th at the cinema village in new directed by who has a background as a sound it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of today as a possible trigger of according to babels multiple identity as communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by who is the grandson of babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work babel was executed for treason in having been charged with belonging to a group and spying for and babels wife who died at the age of in is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new times obituary she was formidable in her own right

educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director m and visits by foreign luminaries like and it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original revolution rather than to fall in line as a toady as he travels around encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in and the stories focus on gangsters living in an hardly the material expect to find written by a partisan of the revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to homo a me or i am and

by why did they vote for this if we understand why that choice was we will all get and not only in north but also all over the since the results of the latest presidential elections were i am longing for while the overwhelming cacophony of deafening noises is assaulting my and in fact all my senses suddenly everyone around me wants to to and to declare people who are surrounding as well as those who are far away from me are frantically watching the reading newspapers and browsing through countless political websites my friends and comrades all over the world are poking jokes at the us political or trembling in anticipation of something even apocalyptic many are just having fun even some thoughtful and educated individuals are behaving like obsessive football passing and spending countless hours on the in front of their television screens of course there are also many gigantic protests in countless cities against the the leader of the mightiest nation on earth there are some massive desperate and hopeless protests there are also personal resigned shrugs of shoulders and downcast glances overall there is a lot of noise everyone is speaking from the top of his or her lungs people are shouting over each other they want to be desperately while very few are listening very few also appear to be reflecting on what is being said by the on what is truly on what has happened despite millions of words and images assaulting our brains from all i know that something is definitely something and even something essential it is not just my analytical mind that comprehends it is also my intuition as a i want to smash those television sets in my i want to throw newspapers into the garbage and i want to go far from all my politicizing friends and comrades but what is it that is being omitted in the official and even in the alternative what is it that i want to longing to hear so much longing with such even with such am i desperate for some precise for exact for revealing am i yearning for one brilliant for a do i want to hear from someone why on earth did the people elect someone like like or is it all actually much more simple and do i expect those wise words to come from my own typed into my computer with my own how did it all really come to and what will happen what will happen to them the what will happen to the which despite everything used to be my home for many what will happen to which took so but which also gave me i kept above what will happen to the to the entire which is now my true and which is also their true home of the although perhaps they do not fully comprehend it yet i did not want to hear the i care less about the numbers i was not longing for and i felt absolutely no desire to there was only one longing left in to to to absorb the millions of voices of those who just recently went to the polls and stuck those pieces of paper into most likely changing the destiny of the world and since i knew i be able to absorb millions of i wanted to listen to at least a few hundred or even thousands of them if possible i wanted to hear the stories of those men and women from the from the deep from isolated farms and exhausted mining towns i wanted to put my glass of beer next to in some and just nod and whisper what so many storytellers before have done for and what they will be saying for many centuries to please tell me your story i want to hear their stories so i can collect arrange and pass them onto the world i want the people who voted for trump to speak to to to let me into their thoughts and emotions i want to understand what occurred through their stories i want to judge i am usually very very and very ideological this time i have no desire to be this is too too damn i owe that much that is the least i can do to return to fly there all the way from to rent a and drive from coast to for long and to finally listen to trying to understand who they what they and i am what i am because i am a passionate i was once told by one of the greatest people always know what goes on all we have to do is to listen to them and we have to lead them only when they ask when they order us to do so there is no doubt in my mind that now is the time to attentively listen to the to fill newspapers and websites with their words but almost no one seems to be doing that all we hear is why they voted as they did how they particular classes or states we read about numbers but we hear people we hear them formulating the words and that is what i am longing to shut to be and to listen and i want other intellectuals to shut up and to humbly listen not because i agree with what the have done not because i want trump to lead the country and the empire not because i suddenly fell in love with the small people it is simply because the people of the most powerful country on earth have because they made their choice and if we understand why that choice was we will all get and not only in north but also all over the i want to listen and to understand so the course of action can be so that we know where all this will lead because this is not the just the beginning of something
other writers if becomes expect disaster if trump is he will have to be smarter than in order to survive never before in history has a presidential candidate been surrounded by so many implacable enemies baying for his blood by the saker the united states is about to enter what might possibly be the deepest and most dangerous crisis of its history maybe trump will be the guy to bring down the empire in order to save the united states the saker watching the last presidential debate was a rather depressing experience i thought that trump did pretty but that really is not the point here the point is no matter who an acute crisis is inevitable option one wins would be on steroids only worse remember that himself was only worse of was just only worse now the circle is closed back to except this time we have a woman who is deeply who failed at every single thing that she every tried to and who now has a three decades long record of disasters and failures even when she had no authority to start a she started one bill to bomb the now she has that authority and now she had to stand in front of millions of and hear trump tell her outsmarted you at every step of the way did you see her frozen face when he said trump is right did outsmart her and at every step the problem is that after having a president with an inferiority complex towards we will have a president with the very same inferiority complex and a morbid determination to impose a zone over forces in looking at with her ugly short hair and ridiculous i thought to myself this is a woman who is trying hard to prove that she is every bit as tough as any man except of course that she her record also shows her as being cowardly and with a sense of total impunity and that evil messianic lunatic with a inferiority complex is going to become commander in god help us option trump wins trump will be completely alone the have repeat total control of the the banking and and the courts from to they have deeply infiltrated the foggy and the three letter agencies the fed is their stronghold how in the world will trump deal with these rabid crazies in the basement consider the vicious hate campaign which all these personalities actors to politicians to have unleashed against trump they have burned their they know that they will lose it all if trump wins if he proves to be an easy pushover his election will make no difference the have nothing to lose and they will fight to the very last one what could trump possibly do to get anything done if he is surrounded by and their agents of bring in an entirely different how is he going to vet his first choice was to take pence as a a disaster is already sabotaging trump on and the elections i dread to hear whom trump will appoint as a white house chief of staff as i am afraid that just to appease the he will appoint some new version of the infamous and should trump prove that he has both principles and the can always him and replace him with pence et i see only one way the model when came to power he inherited a every bit as corrupt and as the white house nowadays as for she was in pretty much the same sorry shape as the independent was also run by bankers and puppets and most led miserable lives the big difference is unlike what is happening with the version of the us never saw the danger coming from he was selected by the ruling elites as the representative of the security services to serve along a representative of the big corporate this was a compromise solution between the only two parts of the society which were still the security services and money looked like a petty bureaucrat in an ill fitting a shy and somewhat awkward little guy who would present no threat to the powerful oligarchs of the seven running except that he turned out to be one of the most formidable rulers in history here is what did as soon as he came to he the credibility of the with the armed forces and security services by rapidly and effectively crushing the insurgency in this established his personal credibility with the people he would have to rely on to deal with the oligarchs he used the fact that every single businessman and corporation in did more or less break the law during the if only because there really was no law instead of cracking down on the likes of or for their political he crushed them with charges of corruption he did that very sending a clear message to the other the media contrary to the hallucinations of the western human rights agencies and never directly suppressed any or cracked down on the media even less ordered the murder of anybody he did something much smarter remember that modern journalists are first and foremost by mercilessly cracking down on the oligarchs deprived the of their source of income and political support some emigrated to the others simply and a few were left like on a reservation or a zoo on a few very clearly identifiable media outlets such as radio or the newspaper those who emigrated became irrelevant as for those who stayed in the liberal they were harmless and they had no credibility left everybody else got the message after all it took is the appointment a few real patriots as margarita and in key positions and everybody quickly understood that the winds of fortune had now turned once the main media outlets were returned back to sanity it did not take too long for the liberal the meaning parties to enter into
yahoo news director wrote his bombshell letter to congress on about newly discovered emails that were potentially pertinent to the investigation into private email server before agents were able to review any of the material because the bureau had not yet gotten a search warrant to read three government officials who have been briefed on the probe told yahoo news when wrote the he had no idea what was in the content of the one of the officials referring to recently discovered emails that were found on the laptop of disgraced the estranged husband of top aide is under investigation for allegedly sending illicit text messages to a girl as of the had still not gotten approval from the justice department for a warrant that would allow them to read any of the newly discovered and therefore are still in the dark about whether they include any classified material that the bureau has not already seen we do not have a a senior law enforcement official said discussions are underway the and the justice as to the best way to move forward that and other senior officials were unaware of what was in the emails and whether they contained any material the had not already obtained is important because the campaign of trump and republicans in congress have suggested that the director would not have written his letter unless he had been made aware of significant new emails that might justify reopening the investigation into the server but a message that wrote to all agents seeking to explain his decision to write the controversial letter strongly hinted that investigators did not not yet have legal authority establishing probable cause to review the content of emails on electronic devices in that told agents that he had only been briefed on about the matter and that the recommendation of investigators was with respect to seeking access to emails that have recently been found in an unrelated case approved the recommendation to seek judicial access to the material that he wrote because those emails appear to be pertinent to our i agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review he told agents letter to congress has brought the director under withering criticism top justice department officials were described by a government source as apoplectic over the letter senior officials strongly discouraged from sending telling officials last week it would violate longstanding department policy against taking actions in the days before an election that might influence the a official familiar with the matter told yahoo news he was acting independently of the guidance given to said the official insisted in his message to agents that he felt he had an obligation to inform congress about the new material because he had previously testified that the bureaus investigation into the email server was completed he said it would be misleading to the people were we not to supplement the record he given that we know the significance of this newly discovered collection of i want to create a misleading impression the decision to send the letter said the senior law enforcement official and top officials debated what course to take once they learned about the discovery on laptop said to include thousands of emails in the the official feared that if he chose to move forward and seek access to the emails and immediately alert the efforts would leak to the media and the director would be accused of concealing information this was the least bad the senior official said but letter to congress suggesting that the might now revisit the email probe may have been even more some critics charged this letter is troubling because it is vaguely worded and leaves so many questions sen the ranking democrat on the senate judiciary and three other democrats on the panel wrote and attorney general lynch it is not clear whether the emails identified by the are even in the custody of the whether any of the emails have already been whether secretary sent or received or whether they even have any significance to the previous the senators wrote a yahoo news review of interview with agents last when the email probe was in full swing shows that the longtime aide hinted that there might be relevant material on her husbands personal devices but agents do not appear to have followed up on the clues who served as deputy chief of staff and held a security disclosed she had access to four email accounts while working at the state department these included an official state department email but also an account on private email server that used to communicate with and her top as well as a personal yahoo account she used both the email account and the yahoo account to routinely forward state department emails and documents so she could more easily print she said in she told the she had a separate email account that she had previously used to support her husbands political activities interview conducted by agents at the field office last was the first that the longtime aide might have circulated official state department material among her multiple accounts at one agents even confronted on one apparently sensitive email about policy towards that had been forwarded to her state department account from an aide to the late then a special state department envoy to and had forwarded the email to her yahoo account in order to print but told agents she was unaware of the classification of the document and stated that she did not make judgments on the classification of material she received she relied on the sender to make that assessment and to properly make and transmit the document there is no indication from the report on the that the agents ever pressed her on what has now turned into an explosive issue in

mysterious universe do other realities brush up against our are there parallel dimensions lying just beyond through some untraceable veil separating the idea of parallel realities beyond our own is not yet what if this phenomenon were to come bursting forth from the realm of theory and speculation and come crashing down into the are there perhaps some people who have stepped over that barrier into domains we have not yet to see and which we may indeed not even be meant to i have covered such alleged excursions into the horizon beyond our known reality here at mysterious universe before and here i will revisit this topic with a selection of other cases that seem to imply the possibility that not only are parallel dimensions but that they are destinations to which we can be whisked whether intentional or not in the issue of fate magazine there was the curious story of a woman who apparently shifted into another parallel universe in according to the in the fall of that year a woman by the name of golding had a profoundly unusual experience while riding an elevator with her in the elevator was and when made a mistake and got off at the wrong floor she found that she could not push her way back in past the throng of people and resigned herself to waiting for the next one that was when she looked around and was startled to realize that she was no longer in the store at but rather an expansive train station the enormous railway station she found herself in was allegedly bustling with fevered with throngs of travelers rushing to their trains and booming announcements of arrivals and departures echoing through the air there seemed to be no way this busy place could have any connection whatsoever to the music store she had been in moments before the confused made her way to an information booth to ask where she but found that the woman working there completely ignored as if she there at all followed a series of signs pointing the way to the street and she emerged out into a sunny afternoon that seemed to be in the midst of summer rather than in a place that was most certainly not she wandered about in confusion and noticed that everyone around her seemed to completely ignore her and walk on by as if they did not even see her at some point she claims that she saw a confused looking boy standing in the sidewalk similarly being passed on by people who seemed to have no idea he was even and approached him wondering what was going on the boy was able to actually see and respond to and looked in her the first time anyone had acknowledged her presence in this surreal place as she the boy seemed equally relieved that he was visible to smiled slightly and purportedly i guess they let you off at the wrong too the two lost people walked together down the street in the whole time completely ignored by those around and the boy told of what had happened to him he claimed that he had been playing tennis in in the united and had gone to the locker room to change his shoes when he had gone back to the courts to play some more he had found that the tennis courts that had been there moments before were now gone and in their place was a huge train which had turned out to be the exact same station into which had enigmatically entered from the elevator the two allegedly kept on walking until they reached an open area that led to and over the waves they could apparently make out a sand bar with several women upon it chatting and seeming to act as if nothing was beyond the ordinary to one of the women was oddly her sister the women out on the sandbar seemed to notice them and began waving and shouting to and her companion this encouraged the boy to try and make a swim out to the which did not seem so far and which he was confident he could reach yet even though he was a good swimmer it seemed that no matter how much he tried and pushed against the he was unable to draw any closer to the mysterious sandbar and he returned to shore in frustration it was then that the sandbar supposedly suddenly vanished into thin air closed her eyes in and and then was overcome by the sensation of floating through space after some time of this odd feeling of hovering in darkness she claimed that she suddenly opened her eyes to find herself sitting atop a stool in the music store in which seemed to be in the process of closing for the suggesting that she had been there for at least several hours looked around for her but could not find him and decided to head back to his home when she her was noticeably relieved and explained that he had lost her in the store and had waited for her to come to the right floor for a few hours before deciding to go back home the whom had seen on the mysterious sandbar claimed that she had seen in town and had even called out to but that she had been too absorbed in talking to a young boy to notice her where did go during that why should she see her sister on a sandbar while the sister had seen her in all while they could not reach across to were they separated by strange barriers we do not and may not ever it is a mystery another strange article in the issue of fate magazine tells of the weird experience of a e of who in was traveling home with her husband and four children from a weekend trip to on the way they noticed what looked

the purpose of inform and influence operations is not to provide a or lay out a policy it is defined as the ability to make audiences think and act in a manner favorable to the mission objectives this is done through applying perception management techniques which target the audiences and techniques are not geared for debate it is to overwhelm and change the target psyche using these techniques information sources can be manipulated and those that or think counter to the objective are relegated as or irrelevant global us psychological warfare in w hat if the and clamor that the world has seen in the presidential campaign were part and parcel of an inform and influence operation against to determine the election bear with me for a moment as i lay out the proofs the quote above is from

the process of the leader who is the ultimate target harding or and influence as defined by the us army includes the fields of psychological operations and military deception all of this is used in the civilian world the same way by private contractors in this private contractors were hired to focus their capacity to influence the population this is proven and you deserve a step by step look at it if you are voting what project shows is damning evidence of what i have been documenting in the series articles since spring by using mainstream they started an integrated approach which includes influencing their political opponents decision making media is given messages that follow the same themes and fill the entire information space by using an across the board effort the effort drowns out any other message according to the this has been happening throughout the election cycle to benefit rather than informing voters to enrich democracy the mainstream media has developed a feedback loop between support for particular candidates and the political agenda they intend to support the freedom of the press is necessary for a democracy to function the article further points out that it was the media that helped rig the primaries against sanders has clearly shown the interplay between mainstream media and the campaign and they have shown clearly that most of the mainstream media are

from monster to democrats grovel before trump by information clearing house within a day of the election of leading democrats have moved with extraordinary speed to declare their support for the invited trump to the white house for a friendly meeting on he declared afterwards that his priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our is successful he speaking to i want to emphasize to that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you if you then the country declaration stands in stark contrast to his own statements just a few days ago then he asserted that trump appears to only care about himself and know basic facts that need to know to be president he added that trump spent years on this earth showing no regard for working was before the democratic debacle on election day now he declares his highest priority to be ensuring that trump is comments followed the statement by on that she hoped will be a successful president for all senator the supposed issued his own groveling to the degree that trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this i and other progressives are prepared to work with such the democrats are in effect abandoning any pretense of acting as an opposition party to a president trump and a proclamations of support from top democrats are made in relation to an individual whose election clearly marks a watershed in politics what is coming to power is a government of the extreme with fascistic characteristics there are reports that trump wants to appoint as his chief of staff the head of an and fascistic media outlet his top advisors and likely cabinet appointees include reactionary figures such as former new mayor and new jersey governor their rush to lend the transition of power an aura of the democrats and the media have maintained a studious silence about certain quite striking elements of the one is noting that a principal factor in the election of trump was a significant decline in voter turnout for all of the media talk of a surge of white working class voters behind the republican candidate actually received one million fewer votes than mitt received in losing the election to won million fewer votes than won in his when the outgoing president obtained significantly fewer votes than he had received in also virtually ignored is the extraordinary fact that trump failed even to win the popular vote had a higher percentage of the national but she lost in the electoral which involves a complex and antidemocratic apportionment based on victories in individual states trump will take office having failed to secure a let alone a of the overall the entire history of the united there have been only five elections in which the incoming president did not win the popular vote when this happened in the b became though he had fewer votes than the j the political conflict over the outcome was so intense that the republicans were able to hold the white house only after agreeing to the effective end of war through the withdrawal of federal troops from the a split vote in when grover lost to the winner of the electoral vote was also the winner of the popular vote for the next years in the this anomaly has now happened and again in in the former the selection of w bush as president required the intervention of the supreme court to halt the recount of ballots in trump found himself in the position of he would have taken his time before conceding his concession when and if it would have stressed that he had won the popular vote and that crooked could not claim a media message would have stressed the need for to be conciliatory and acknowledge that the majority of the voters had chosen trump one can easily imagine announcing the breaking news that had withdrawn the nomination of choice for the supreme court and invited the republicans to name the replacement for the deceased the democrats have done just the is behind this universal president said perhaps more than he intended when he declared that we have to remember that were actually all on one team this is an intramural a test competition involving players from the same united states does not really have an oppositional political system the divisions between the democrats and and between and are of an entirely tactical character they all defend the same basic of the corporate and financial aristocracy that controls the political this the democrats are always the more accommodating and conciliatory since their rhetorical references to defending the interests of working by the likes of thoroughly vacuous and insincere in relation to trump and the dangers he there is an element of complete which arises from the fact that the danger is not to the democrats or the privileged social forces for which they but to the working chief concern of the democrats is to contain popular anger their moves to circle the wagons around trump are above all a response to the danger they see of the emergence of popular opposition that threatens not only the incoming but the capitalist system as sanders and company prostrate themselves and pledge their loyalty to thousands of youth and workers are demonstrating around the country against the these protests are only a pale and politically disparate foretaste of mass struggles of the working class that are to is critical is that the lessons of the election be drawn and all attempts to keep opposition to war and austerity chained to the political corpse of the democratic party be rejected the task is not to take back the democratic party or push it to the inevitable result of that false perspective has already been demonstrated in the reactionary outcome of the sanders to break with both parties of
riots in on third night of protests trump returns to twitter to complain about protests by media by reason there were more protests around the country against the election of trump last with police in declaring the protest there a riot due to deteriorating conditions rioters there threw objects at attacked newspaper and smashed windows police said protesters were trying to stop from destroying and tweeted that it encouraged others to leave the before declaring the situation a riot and issuing orders to disperse the police say they made arrests and dispersed the crowd using pepper ball distraction and rubber baton returned to twitter for the first time since being elected on night after spending the day in tweeting that incited by the are calling it news described the tweet as an end to a brief stretch of conciliatory behavior since although one salty tweet in a hour period does seem like enough data to come to that conclusion trump had to as news put also pointing out trump himself had tweeted in favor of a march on after mitt and suggested if he lost riots could least two other prominent trump sheriff and former rep had also tweeted supportively of protests and civil disobedience before the election but called for a tough response after they did not expect trump to so the calculus changed things are different now that he not for trump tendency to make loose statements and the media tendency to botch interpretations of those tweet was characterized as not sure what was expected at this particularly since such protests until worked in trump favor the trump campaign a rally in after massive protests there trump said the protests would his clinched the nomination in may by i noted how attacks on trump supporters by protesters were an apparent effort to help get trump elected in late when protests and riots erupted in after a fatal police shooting i suggested the city was working hard to get north in the trump when there were protests and around the i suggested this trend to could end up helping trump by earning him political capital and helping drive conservatives back into the fold protesters say they are demonstrating because trump has created a climate of fear for minorities riots also have that tendency if the mostly white rioters in last night provide police in the city to ramp up that endangers marginalized people the most protests last month over a police contract the outgoing mayor pushed through before leaving office failed to stop the and it not unreasonable to fear tonight riots will increase tensions in altogether different for all the talk of what else could violent protests over the result of an election be other than voter won but that still leaves a minority of trump voters watching their fellow citizens destroy property over the way they voted and it leaves a slew of residents who did but will probably eventually be blamed for trump win as well blame anyone but and the democratic protesters like to compare trump to yet it does seem they understand their own comparison used civil the greatly expand his powers after he had already been elected at the republican trump called a crime and said he could solve the country problems protesters are setting the stage for him it hard to imagine what continued violent protests group has organized as a can accomplish other than creating a climate of fear trump could exploit to make it easier to get what he whatever that turns out to of a mostly white riot in would perhaps be incomplete with a note about the occupation of a remote outpost in the national wildlife refuge in in protest of federal prosecutors reneging on a plea deal with two ranchers who had set a fire on their property that spread onto federal appealing the sentences handed down in favor for longer ones those protesters were called by many commentators because they were armed the went viral no one has suggested or have been under attack nor has anyone called the protesters or rioters terrorists but as one side has created a precedent when it was convenient rhetorically in the short term that can be used by the other side with as if not protesters are concerned about the powers trump will president and the congress have two and a half months to try to get something accomplished in terms of limiting executive power the prospect is unlikely already protests make the prospect less and also place efforts at reducing government power after trump is in office at a disadvantage although protesters may be more interesting in expressing their including by than reducing government power and constraining the office of the smashed protest in proclaimed riot some people started their protest at pioneer courthouse square and moved to northeast according to the daily about time for an trump death threats swamp twitter numerous disgruntled have taken to twitter to encourage the murder of echoing the reaction to election albeit from a different side of the political

rotten to the core who will be in trump a few possibilities by information clearing house today after a stunning win that upended the political trump and his top advisers now must put together a white house staff and cabinet a group that may well include some of those same are a few possibilities for some of the most powerful roles in a new trump administration the city mayor became one of trump surrogates the former prosecutor could now be in line for attorney the speaker became a top adviser and television spokesperson for trump during the campaign and was even among the real estate mogul finalists for running mate he is said to be interested in becoming secretary of corker the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee could also be a possibility to lead the state a onetime trump emerged as one of trump most steadfast surrogates the renowned physician would be an obvious candidate to be surgeon the retired general emerged as trump most visible military adviser he could be in line for defense secretary or some other national security sessions during the primary sessions became the first sitting member of the senate to endorse trump campaign the senator could be another possibility to lead the the chairman of the republican national committee which ran the trump campaign operation could wind up as trump white house chief of trump finance formerly of is in line to possibly become treasury though shadowed by the recent the new jersey governor has been a fixture at trump side since endorsing him in and will likely have his eye on a spot in the new administration at the justice department or in the white the news executive became trump campaign in august he could be in line for a spot as a white house his job is already known vice president the governor and former congressman is expected to play a large role in the trump administration as a partner to the new who lacks any experience serving in government
the foul stench of fascism in the may be shocked by the election of trump but black and brown smelt it throughout this summer and i have interviewed fellow asking them about their feelings and experiences regarding this presidential election in all of these one thing was we knew this was some of it hung like a foul smell in the air the acrid stench that generations before somehow learned to live though it choked them many of us coughed and spluttered when that suffocating air filled our lungs some of us cried out in when those of us who spoke up were heard at we were greeted with or with laughter like some i wrote about that were given the assurance that there were some for whom that acrid stench was a breath of fresh but those foolish people were few and unimportant we were told the smell would go away on its own it went nowhere it lingered and it got for some of it was more than a smell for some unlucky ones such as it became a physical parked his car in my beloved town of hood to take his dog for a walk as told the town started to get out of the and heard someone the car door smacked my head and then my head hit the door frame i lost part of my memory for about news of the assault hit our small it shocked us all we had a hard time believing especially when reported that the only other words he heard were you is not a he is a monk in typical monk his response was filled with am happy it happened to me and not to a he ca feel safe in a third of my own in my we spoke at length about the assault and what it meant by we had already seen that racism and white nationalism were on the rise the fact that an innocent monk was attacked at all was but that he was attacked for being something he for being nothing more than not was what really my town assumed it was isolated we assumed there was a small minority of people filled with assumed that the smell would go away on its news stories abounded about white people verbally or physically attacking and people with disabilities many people mostly white allies thought that it was rare not something to worry did believe that for a is a black designer who was living in in but was returning to his native white girlfriend and i are moving back to this he told me had originally planned to drive across the country and stop in new and phoenix needless to we not doing that any and his girlfriend took an plane instead too many stories of white backlash attacks in too many disparate places made them cancel their was jokingly worried about being opinionated in the south before this he said it untenable it incredibly sad that in i ca feel safe in a third of my own is not alone by many minority people in had already changed their and outlook marina an artist from began to avoid eye contact with people on the metro when someone looked at her and people are so experiences with actions and violence have existed before but have gotten the attention they getting now social media makes sharing these experiences easier than ever so things encountered kept to but with and twitter talking about with people throughout the i saw this pattern repeated minority people of various and racial groups were all doing the same were talking about the foul smell in the pointing out the real danger to anyone who would and they were all being more cautious around white people many of them changed their in subtle ways wear headphones more at work said a white lesbian woman who wants to remain anonymous for fear of a backlash at the legal practice where she works outside i just want to avoid the chance of getting into was being verbally assaulted and called because she spoke about wanting to marry her partner even in national symbol of a lesbian woman felt afraid to argue for her right to a marriage that the state had already given a black writer and actor in who did not want his real name had a somewhat similar take on avoiding arguments when he talked about the police goal is not to win the he told me goal is to get home happens to be tall and his car is fitted with special gearing to allow him to drive only with his hands it is a car that only someone his size can a white cop pulls me over one he told is looking me up and looking at my insurance and my and he asks me this your i what is that question supposed to we all know what it supposed to mean you looking at my and i have a car only i can drive i know why you asking that but not going to say because the goal is to get home so i just say sir it is white men are taking back to the i heard similar responses throughout the summer and minority people universally spoke of this election as a they spoke of being scared white people universally saw it as an accidental event that would just that could really happen warned us of exactly that sentiment a political writer who studied has written of the seriousness of this election in numerous telling us that ca happen is exactly how fascism happens her essays are like a plan for how to avoid a yet it seems that no one wanted to bring her map on this i warned us writing that are on the cusp of a historic decision in the us we can make history and transition from the first black to the first female

by most interesting watching the progress of the comprehensive economic and trade agreement between and the through the various opaque ministrations this past week first as the progeny of north free trade agreement it serves to refer to a bit of history former prime minister very recently on said that was a wonderful agreement he said that its purpose generally was to help all economies but more specifically to help workers who at that time had been devastated by the devaluation of the peso due to capital flight from of the many outcomes of fiat currency the record does not support this used the example that this year more were returning home than entering the implying it was due to the success more realistically it has been due to the increasing police violence in the accompanied by the election cycle fought between a manipulative liar and a misogynist xenophobic narcissist the truth behind is different yes thousands of jobs were created in the along the border these jobs were filled by workers who in general were displaced from their lands through a combination of two economic hits first was the and its structural adjustment programs and admitted at least in an economic not in a political control applied after the debt collapse this was quickly followed or accompanied by which allowed ample cheap subsidized agricultural products to flow into cutting the main basis of support for the agricultural sector not only was not good for it also seriously affected well paying jobs in and the as corporations moved their production to where the wages and benefits were lowest as for much of the increased trade was not due to increased economic activity but the recording of transactions that used to take place internally views of the rust belt and the declining number of living wage jobs in both and the testify to the negative impact of for the corporations and their managers who have gained enormously another aspect of that is of note is the political manipulations that occurred in was essentially a conservative creation under pm as above the conservative party was devastated in in part due to also due to other domestic interesting part being that his jean liberal campaigned against but once in power accepted it as it was additional side deals and one of its significant other than selling out workers and was the trade dispute settlement the appropriately labeled chapter section this allows for supranational national closed door arbitration panels staffed by selection rather than qualification than perhaps their financial along with this is that a foreign corporation can sue the government for perceived loss of profits due to some regulation or regulations that would generally serve to protect the the benefits of and the independent agricultural sector this has resulted in many lawsuits against sovereignty that has cost the taxpayer billions of dollars in lawyers fees and settlements to companies that may or may not have intended to set up business here in the first place it has also caused the government to change some of its regulations in of corporations begets the same indicators on dispute settlement occur with many informed citizens object to corporations having supranational rights over sovereignty both in and the concerns that reflect the same investor dispute settlement mechanisms note also that it is investor dispute and not citizen meaning that the average citizen cannot sue either the government or the corporations for damages to wages et there is a lawsuit currently underway to challenge the constitutional legality of the agreement as it also overrides and first nations jurisdiction these are not national functions but can be effectively manipulated through various degrees of transfer payments and the good old fashioned crony benefit payment system the opposed the investor dispute in part because it would facilitate the loss of an independent agricultural sector in effect branch suing for agricultural of agricultural sector is already by a small number of supranational while listening to on discuss and the he said it was amazing how money and politics are intertwined if that is the ignorant level of commentary that can considering it abides by establishment guidelines no wonder we get little truth from the media and the intertwined what is truly being negotiated with but

their ability to manipulate a relying instead on their false majority of the in the house to give it in very similar to the and also very similar to our wherein the democrats and republicans are essentially two sides of the same much literally as it is the coin that determines not the house nor the ever absent but on the rhetoric from this morning was quite with the same old platitudes brought forth he indicated we need economic growth contribute to we have progressive values and concerns very similar to the the dispute mechanism is a progressive and has provided leadership on values with countries even though it needs to be ratified after it has a provisional implementation clause that clause has not been and we will feel benefits and it is good for middle class sounds but if is our not much benefit will be seen by the middle not much progress will be made how is that not many jobs will be created to lift the poor up into the middle class by and what really are our

by brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election there are some observations which deserve attention these unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of and the election demonstrated perhaps better than and better than has been generally been that a plutocracy it took a genuine a a man with a lifetimes economic to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well with money for their ambitions it was the well of drilled by bill with help from some extremely shady such as that made the keystone establishment figures in the democratic party it was not personal charm or exceptional political in his displayed some of both of earned the their it was the the mothers milk of politics in what is euphemistically called fund many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by bill efforts fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence she lacked bills superficial but she certainly more than shared his ambition on the charm when she was ready to move into running for she perhaps under bills a kind of forced clown face with arched and a smile as big as her lips would and these expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various or waving whenever she campaigned her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a parade or of the late at his most exuberant these were not natural for her they were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive both in a governors mansion and later in the white bizarre because she indulged her husbands predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more and successful knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in politics she determined to build a political war chest long and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed as when running for the when sources of big money suggested another view would more acceptable she was anything but constant in the views she embraced because when she ran for the senate she spent record amounts of embarrassingly large amounts in her years of speaking she aimed at special interests who could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees in the appointed post of secretary of as it into personal contact with every head of government or international unquestionably played an aggressive pay for play with them all covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about a second big fact of the election is that both major political parties are rather sick and fading the republican party has been broken for a very long time it hobbled along for some decades with the help of various hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like family public prayer and catering to the and burning constitutional and now it is truly out of gas that is precisely why a political outsider like oligarch trump could manage to hijack the party he was opposed by boring men like seeking to secure an almost inherited and a intensely phony fundamentalist like and it proved to be no contest it was a remarkable political but i think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party the republican party had been given a some new by in the he had an extremely mixed record as but he was held in some and did have a clear but his effect on the party was not lasting trump could be seen as another but i think the comparison is superficial trump literally hijacked the and he was not deliriously crowned by its establishment the press was too busy attacking him from the start to take notice or do any intelligent and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the establishment he represented his most promising quality is his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the wars vigorously embraced and would expand but the democratic party is in serious too it has a great deal of internal as the material from the clearly shows us lack of ignorance of the people it has always claimed to bad and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms the material tells us about many internal including harsh judgments of resentment over the character of daughter who is said to resemble in her behavior and and the belief of some that just should not have run she had become for many a rather figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected but they not only blindly supported they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable sanders sanders might well have been able to win the election for the but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy after there were bill and beckoning to their running well of money in it might be just as well that sanders was cheated out of the nomination he proved a weak individual in the giving in to just the forces he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down he may well even have been secretly bribed by money from the since he bought a fairly expensive property not long afterward in any there he out on the supporting everything he ever opposed personified in men of that nature do not stand up well to generals and admirals and the heads of massive a quality

by am the voter suppression tactic is right out of the to suppress the black vote in north following is an opinion column by r some are likely aware of the psychological term projecting that roughly means a person attributes their own faults and actions onto someone as an unconscious form of transferring guilt for ones own actions as soon as the republican primaries trump projected republicans guilt for election either through vote obstruction or onto democrats and his opponent republicans have been actively suppressing votes since the election of in and they have only ramped up their election rigging activities over the past eight and yet trump accuses democrats of election rigging as frequently as most human beings draw breath the north conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people filed a lawsuit against north republicans and demanded they put an immediate stop to the coordinated effort to suppress the black vote in the state what the rightly said was that the voter suppression tactic was right out of the to suppress the black vote in the state the election rigging amounts to three counties in north canceling voter registration of thousands mostly democratic residents a week before the presidential election the lawsuit charged election officials in and counties of denying primarily voters eligibility to participate in democracy because their voter registration documents mysteriously were bounced back as undeliverable most of the voters whose eligibility to vote was denied and flagged for such as had moved within the same county and were still legally allowed to cast ballots many of the purged voters lived at their original registration address and were victims of a simple postal service error is an who lives in a nursing home and has voted in at least the last elections in the same county he was born and raised in without issue testified that like thousands of other democratic never received any state or county election documents informing him that his eligibility was or that if he attend an appeal hearing to maintain his right to vote he would be denied the right to participate in democracy if i knew my right to vote was in i would do whatever i could to protect it i want and plan to vote in the upcoming but i am concerned that since my registration has been canceled i will not be able to cast a ballot or it will not be counted it is what any sane human being would consider election rigging simply because the ploy targeted primarily who typically vote for democrats it is also something north republicans have been guilty of for the past six years according to the north republicans are in violation of the national voter registration act which bans the systemic removal of voters from the rolls in the final days before an election republican election officials state officials defended their election rigging and said they were justified in purging of mainly democratic voters the definition of on an individual basis the also accused republicans of conducting a coordinated mailing campaign for the sole purpose of challenging the eligibility of thousands of mainly voters eligibility who did not receive the mailing one republican who ran for a local office last challenged the registration of the majority who are them in county in one of the other counties charged in the one individual used returned mail to challenge the registrations of mostly democratic voters in the secretary of the local republican n carol challenged approximately mainly registered likely because they do not vote for republicans the lead attorney for the said that although she cannot yet prove there is a concerted republican election rigging we know that in two of the the people who brought the challenges had connections to the local republican party we also know that the pattern of these challenges is very similar across the counties ms hair also noted in county the return address of a group called the voter integrity project appeared on the mail that was used to challenge voters this is a very pernicious treatment of voters she said it is also a deliberate act of election rigging by republicans the president of the north reverend barber we are seeing the worst attempts of voter suppression here in north that seen since the days of crow the tar heel state is ground zero in the surgical efforts to suppress the voice of voters these attempts are a direct affront to our constitution the lawsuit is demanding the state reinstate all voters challenged since using this election rigging process back on the rolls immediately the organization also demands that the state notifies the voters that they have been reinstated as eligible and allow them to cast regular ballots early or on election day they have already put in a request for an emergency hearing this week to decide the case it might be the case that the request for a hearing may be especially in light of these new charges arising just days after a federal court ruled that north republicans violated the national voter registration act in yet another failing to add tens of thousands of voters to the rolls who registered at a office over the past few years last district court judge ordered north republicans to permit those of voters to cast provisional ballots it is highly doubtful that north republicans will obey the federal judges orders because they have been the recipients of several court orders over their election rigging actions that have had no effect whatsoever or the republicans would not continue disenfranchising voters republicans have been on a tear to rig elections since the people first elected as and the conservatives on the supreme court are ultimately guilty of conspiring with republicans to or the voting rights of primarily people of color because they support republicans to be perfectly it is irrelevant if it is called voter or it is a deliberate attempt to rig elections

now and members of the political establishment will be able to try on new experiment with new campaign and determine who will play a starring role within the inner circle the central consideration is how to consolidate power in a way that balances the interests of the government and the get an inside look at current political direct sat down with of the center according to the parliamentary elections provide a preview of what to expect in and to what extent were the parliamentary elections fair and in your in they were juridically legitimate because they were conducted in accordance with law the degree of the not juridical legitimacy is a debatable question because of the low it means that the representation of citizens in the parliament became even less than previously about of the population voted at the elections though the united ruling party garnered four million fewer votes than during the it received more seats in the parliament in liberal politicians are not included in the parliament at all the legitimacy of the elections is a matter of these elections were fair in the polling stations with to a large extent they were honest in the in which the central election commission controlled the electoral process in cooperation with observers a lesser these elections were fair and transparent in the distant regions or in the words of prominent political expert zones of peculiar electoral which saw an abnormally high electoral turnout i for the republic of in southern the north region etc regions were controlled by the central election commission to a much lesser extent no wonder that people were compelled to vote in accordance with the orders of local authorities the violations in these regions were likely to be common associate and chair of the domestic politics and political institutions program at the center press photo does central election commission have any tools to influence voting in the distant there are some but local authorities limit and restrict them i think the administration of the president hampered the work of the central election commission she tried to balance the interests of president and the interests of the civil society is the position and it is very difficult she just tried to take into account all positions and signals that were coming from the regions during the electoral campaign and could not ignore them there were so many of these signals that she objectively and physically could not control the throughout the in the distant regions what kinds of violations took place during the if violations took even though they were not like previously during the elections these violations included the use of administrative resources for rigged and fabricated stuffing the ballot and dirty political techniques against the liberal and communist parties during the political campaign and before election day was also orchestrated when students and governmental employees were ordered to vote this also should be taken into account all these violations took place not only in distant but also in those under the steady control of the central election why did the united party win despite its declining popularity throughout the fact the united won the majority in the state and the popularity are basically different things its popularity has been decreasing indeed it is one reality but it prevent the party from winning most of the seats that is the other reality citizens see the party as a body that deals with the problems of the population the credibility and approval rankings of almost all governmental except law enforcement agencies and the president are dropping and united is not the because people perceive it not as a but as a kind of a governmental body its rating will keep going but step by step if you vote for united it means a symbolic a sort of political ritual if you are and go to the polling you are likely to vote for united because it is necessary this is the very logic and motivation that drive average voters to elect united though some people preferred not to vote for the ruling they voted for the current because there were no real they voted either for one of the three systemic parliamentary parties or the spoiler which aimed at distracting the attention of voters and preventing the opposition from gaining parliamentary seats why did the opposition fail and what is its key the reason why they failed can be traced back to the personal ambitions of the opposition leaders they team up and compete with each other in they have different in fact i mean liberals and liberals always agree this does after all these leaders have enough political heft most of them cannot be considered powerful and influential political figures problem is that the authoritarian regime in will prevent the emergence of new powerful liberal forces in if such a party emerges and poses a serious challenge to the authorities like opposition leader it will be either destroyed or discredited and marginalized in such a it is very difficult to come up with a pragmatic solution this years parliamentary elections proved that the only political democratic force on a scale of a whole country is the party and its leader no matter how you view them it is losing popularity year after but this party remains firmly within the political landscape and if the opposition is able to persuade voters that brings together different representatives of

turnout remained well below the necessary percent of all valid although percent of voters more than three million people said they wanted the parliament to have a decisive say about any future redistribution of inside the referendum and its campaign had two separate goals the ruling party had to test the loyalty of their political thus they tried to redefine classical political fault lines and checked on the unity of the opposition prime minister used this occasion to bring forward his arguments about reshaping the competences of the especially the commission referendum question has been thoroughly debated ever since it was as it reflects both of the above goals the question you want the union to be able to order the mandatory settlement of citizens in without parliaments political and civil groups were enabled by the ambiguous wording of the question to focus on significantly different interpretations neither the constitutional court nor the national election committee declared the question despite the fact that it raised concerns among experts the constitutional rules within most member states declare that no national referendum should be held on issues already regulated by international a way of getting around this the government later claimed that the referendum did not concern the decisions of mandatory quotas already decided at the level of the council it would only concern future possible the competency of the the council is required to give the final word in any such case of distribution of resettlement or relocation among member in any case where has a way to raise its own voice or to build a blocking coalition the government decided to go against the quota system after the councils decisions of last autumn and went to the court in to dispute the legality of the measure was the final point where the government turned the migration crisis into a sovereignty question it had started in the official government rhetoric already after the attacks on but the referendum question undoubtedly raised the stakes of the debate it is not anymore about whether migrants or refugees should be welcomed or the opinion of the government focuses on the competence of the institutions whether they in enforce decisions on member position is openly on the side that the quota system violates the sovereignty of member states and unnecessarily forces a instead of paying attention to securing the external borders of the area this has been the argument already since last when hundreds of thousands of refugees crossed the country and the route towards the borders must be because if member states start the redistribution the political pressure for a sustainable solution at the border protection level would dissipate and would be left with an influx of uncontrolled deal seriously decreased the number of arriving in the though the route remains open and is under growing pressure again have not seen masses of migrants since last when the

email trump has done what many said could not be done in the wee hours of he exceeded the necessary electoral votes and was announced the winner of the presidential election to call his victory a political upset would be an the establishment media spent the evening watching the votes come in in a state of frenzied disbelief trump campaigned on an platform that both distanced himself from the leadership of the and drew attacks from both leaders and democrats trump came out against free trade agreements such as promised to defend the promised to work to build the and worst of all to the establishment put first whether he will do those things remains to be but the point is that the establishment seems to have pulled out all stops in an effort to keep trump from ever seeing the inside of the white house as anything other than an invited guest what the establishment appears to have overlooked indeed appears to always overlook is the mindset that mindset is as mysterious to the insiders as theirs is to patriotic as wrote for fox news the the pollsters and most importantly the of the political class have never and in fact are psychologically incapable of understanding what is happening and for the entire cycle of this presidential campaign they have failed to grasp what was happening before their eyes for it runs counter to everything they believe about themselves in they are suffering from cognitive dissonance believing in their righteous superiority and are not capable of realizing that it is they who have become the adversary of the people and therefore they have been in this entire election every step of the way goes on to note that the uprising of which trump was the right guard and sanders was the left guard was not created by either trump or it was the other way around and that because of their cognitive dissonance the leaders within the establishment left and missed that for politics only began yesterday they know little history and have no appreciation of the collective consciousness of the people whether it is the campaign of who came within a hairs breadth of knocking out the nominee of the democratic establishment or on the other the emergence of the total outsider the most improbable candidate of all in sanders and sucked from the same trough even if it was from opposite ends but the critical point that is by almost was that neither sanders nor trump created this uprising they were chosen vehicles they did not create these these movements created them by giving the people a choice between disclosures show wanted trump to win the and the establishment put in a position to come out swinging while a great many voters would have preferred a more constitutionally minded the played the same old game it has been playing for the past several election cycles by filling the roster with one establishment republican after the put voters in a position to nominate and then elect trump neither the talking heads of the mainstream

views comments guest posts by my friend roger is a staunch democrat supporter he is in his seventies and has always voted democrat him and i have had countless discussions over the many years that we have known each other his paternal roots are and he sees himself to be on the left side of but of him and i have not been able to see on the race to the issue he is with the view that has inherited a financial and military disaster and did the best he and that he should not be blamed for his failure to perform as many did after his elaborate and successful yes we can slogan he supported and other domestic reform and this is perhaps where roger and i stop to agree and start to disagree including look at the appalling record of the republican party and try to paint a tainted image of it the party that is affectionately called the grand old party or the by its own staunch supporters certainly has enough such records to put it up there with charges of global mayhem and genocide the has given birth to people like the and of who can forget is another character that comes to one that no thinking man could trust with a a federal senator who commands authority that no one seems to be able to either understand the mandate or challenge at the end of the infamous line republican well at least thus enter trump and what a character he need one say god forbid if this article may be read like a defense of the the is run by the rich and the and as described by w bush by the haves and have more it is the party of dick who saw in an opportunity to generate contracts for if tens of hundreds of thousands of had to die for him to achieve his he would not and did not blink this is the party that condones and feeds it is the party that has huge control over the media it is the party that runs the world like it is a business enterprise and whether the rest of the world likes it or until the current global status quo no political party in the world affects the rest of the world like the ruling party in the united states whilst elections in other countries are domestic affairs that affect domestic politics of the country elections have implications that are not only domestically but have a much further global reach that encompasses every corner of the world as a i am much more concerned about the wider global implications of politics than the domestic ones this is not to say that i am indifferent about and the people as a matter of not only do i have close friends who live in but also close family members and i have grave concerns for all mankind in every corner of the by my interest in politics remains focused on foreign policy and to this i am only able to relate to the choice between the major two parties from the perspective of their foreign policies as insists to be the world police and the a stature many are refusing to accept that they have already it must accept what comes with it and concede that the rest of the world is hoping that the people will choose the better candidate as the new or should i say the one who is less harmful to the world in between and who fits the this is the question enough has been recently said about health to write a horror novel her and alleged recent case of pneumonia have made headlines as if not bigger than her infamous hidden allegations of involvement in the murder of an ambassador and even selling arms to very recently the issue of the emails is resurfacing and very late in the perhaps late enough to serve with a knock out her zeal to reach the seems to have been in her mind even before bills scandal back in was prepared to publicly support appear to forgive him and move because she had a bigger fish to the she somehow managed to hush down all other sex allegations against all the and trying to score mileage from similar allegations against trump her unabated lust for power will not stop at anything for as long as she ends up at the the first female even if she has to be commander in chief from behind the control button of a wheelchair there are even observations and allegations that many people who have campaigned against her have died under suspicious circumstances whether this mystery is going to be taken up by main stream media just on the eve of the elections to serve her with yet another knock out remains to be seen her uncontrollable laughs and hysterical facial expressions leave many questions unanswered in between the two front runners and it is hard to say that she presents herself as the sane and rational choice is there a distinction on foreign affairs perhaps but not historically for some the republican party is seen as the party of the hawks and the democrats are seen as the doves but are to answer this question in an unbiased we ought to look back at history notwithstanding the history of the the father and the and what is really the history of the democratic a few landmark historical decisions make it very clear so let us start with current events before we dwell into recent history that some might have chosen to forget the war on was the brainless child of the a spring that was heralded by the visit of an president to and a speech he made to clergy at university the presidents name is and he is a democrat speech was a subtle endorsement for the and to be specific to the street

posted on tweet via in august prime minister had formed a task force to plan for the next three this was followed by our mainstream media writing the usual things the task force should do to improve sports ways can ensure a better showing at how to win medals by or can get you medals in if you spend rs kind of stuff two months down the all is forgotten since we are not a satire site but a serious it was against our ethos to jump the gun and write such an article instead we have done painstaking research for the last months and come up with our suggestions here are our due to our colonial cricket dominates the sporting scene in cricket in its purest form was meant for the aristocratic families of england who had nothing better to do with their time and wanted a game which would keep them occupied for days it is not suitable for common working class who have to earn a living was once the superpower in hockey and there is no reason why we cannot be once again our create a social media campaign to boycott cricket force organizations who sponsor cricket to donate at least rupees for sponsoring other sports impose hefty fines on cricket commentators force to do commentary for hockey and matches it is common to find people in and the surrounding region flaunting their power and influence one has often heard the phrase flaunted by these folks this craving for recognition through power has prompted several impressionable kids in the region to take up aggressive sports to flaunt their power just look at the number of medalists from the region who have won medals in aggressive shooting and wrestling wrestling wrestling who won the bronze in shooting in was brought up in and but his parents hail from the region which explains it the ripple effect from is so strong that even from neighboring won silver medal for shooting in poor found it difficult to practice a sport like badminton in and had to shift to to become a champion and win a bronze medal in our channelize the aggressive and power flaunting energy of the kids early on and we can be assured of a few medals from here in every eastern and southern has produced many medalists like in in in tennis and p v and in badminton along with the likes of who show a promise in a sport where was never in the reckoning our just provide encouragement and things will improve our intellectuals and elites attribute the poor showing of to poverty but then what explains western poor show considering that it has two of the most prosperous and the last medal a person from won at the was in wrestling in but then is home to cricket legends like and of course the cricket commentary of this explains it but what about we are not mainstream media and we do not claim to have expertise on everything and we admit we do not have the answer but the mainstream media which questioned on everything else has kept quiet about this our we do not have an answer to this but we will not keep quiet like the mainstream media why did not produce a single medal will given that the elites blame the lack of facilities in our country for our poor show in what stops the kids of these elites from excelling at with cheap skilled manpower to they should have done well the elites believe in a sense of entitlement and are not willing to work hard sport is a meritocratic activity and only performance matters that is the reason sport is one stream in which is dynasty except for brave exceptions like who are willing to fight against all odds a friendly media and intellectuals ecosystem can make a failed politician look a failed actor a superstar or a news trader a journalist but this ecosystem cannot make a cricket duck look like a cricket century this explains why the son of one of greatest khan who captained cricket team despite having vision in only one chose his mothers profession rather than his fathers his biggest sporting achievement to date remains winning a meters sprint in an macho ad you also know why the daughter of chose acting or why the son of chose journalism of there are exceptions like who went on to become a tennis star despite his father being a member of hockey team and mother being member of basketball team he is also wise in that he choose tennis over hockey or basketball given his ability to get in trouble with his doubles may it be or one wonders how he would have fared in basketball or hockey which has a team of more than players our lack of facilities is not an at least for the elites every other boy wants to become a cricketer for those boys who look beyond analysis of winners show that men have only won in hockey and aggressive sports like boxing and except for in who was anyway born to parents and moved to soon after winning the medals of course is an exception but we already told you why he did not play hockey and also how aggressive he is even towards his partners our do not expect anything from men beyond hockey and aggressive sports compared to women have won medals in a variety of sports and have been very such as in and p v in in boxing and in wrestling the fact that women got opportunity to train and win in sports like boxing and wrestling that are considered the domain of men show how fake the propaganda of the feminist intellectuals is these feminists intellectuals will form stereotypes based on their opinions and peddle it as facts being into responsible we cannot do that so we decided to explore an angle we

top three nations with elite scrabble players on the ratings list is on despite constant travel visa rejections to play in world tournaments besides countries like and also contribute players to the world top an even more astonishing picture of performance unfolds when we look beyond the countries scrabble in in an professional scrabble player from new confirmed his reputation as perhaps the greatest scrabble player in history by winning the world scrabble after memorizing the dictionary in nine weeks his goal in was apparently to hold both the and world championships simultaneously he was robbed of his full glory by the wellington in the but managed to pull off a more phenomenal victory in the language he does not is said to have an authentic photographic memory what caught my eye in all the frenzied media reports was the name of the person defeated in the finals was fully expecting a an had reached the finals of the world when i looked into the history of the scrabble world i was stunned to find that francophone countries have been even more dominant in and over a longer than have become in despite a very active expert scrabble club culture in and other native countries the full list of the top players in the scrabble championship that won gives a clear picture of this world championships final standings a look at demographics makes the scrabble achievement of impossible to explain under the present racial hypothesis has a population of million and a reported national of if the world champion needs an of just should probably be higher than given the level of gender disparity at the very then there is statistically no one in who should ever come anywhere close to the world championship three made it to the top in note that the strongest version of the genetic hypothesis is contradicted even before you do the the very existence of such high interest in a mathematical game can not be predicted from a genetic theory that claims of or human if it is indeed true that have the lowest genetic endowment in mathematical even ability is scrabble perhaps less mathematical than not at all the very fact that someone could successfully cross from scrabble to scrabble should indicate that it requires similar cognitive skills but i still looked at some profiles of the top scrabble players in just to make and found clear signs to confirm this for the entry on best player last player to keep the world championship from and the only one to have won it et est scrabble i do not know any but i can bet that there is the word mathematics somewhere in there and perhaps even an academic career in in returned to defend his world championship title and this time the vowed to keep the crown from him like the year before stole the the two finalists in were both was behind three the math professor and former world could not make it to the top ten as more dominated the world championships final standings positions are notice that the names of the top players are different from the ones in which defies the probability projections from their population and national even further which has probably had the most success at the world championships achieved this with a literacy rate of only something special about scrabble for the man who won the world scrabble championship in from also happens to be a top master player in his country this should immediately suggest that whatever he is using to win his scrabble games probably has something in common with what is needed to be a master in because it is highly improbable to be that exceptional in two different areas that require unrelated skills the question can then be if this is then why also very good in checkers at the world just as they are with checkers an even more natural field for since it is cheaper to make a checkers meet breaking world record for simultaneous play back in a expert from was visiting the colony of when he decided to watch some of the street games in poor communities after the settlers had introduced the game to the black natives he could not believe the accuracy and speed of their despite their lack of exposure to and he decided to expose one of the stronger players to his homeland of where there was a strong checkers club culture among the elites to the utter shock of everyone in the young defeated every single expert in and instantly achieved national fame by becoming the national champion of had once been the most dominant nation in the world of international before the and then the soviet union took this honor from them through the program of monetarily professionalizing chess and checkers careers with the phenomenal rise of the thought they had the chance of recapturing the world championship from the soviets by using this brilliant talent from one of their colonies participated in the world championship tournament and shocked the soviets by coming second in the in a variant of he had just been introduced to that was different from his one was not convinced that there was a human who was better than him at any form of so he decided to challenge the world champion in a more decisive world championship match instead of an open tournament of cumulative points against different players but by the time this match was supposed to had gained enough mastery of this standard variant to convincingly demolish the best of the including their reigning champion and best match play genius at the this made the soviet government reluctant to allow the official world championship match to take apparently for fear of the international embarrassment this title loss would given their heavy investment in the game had the same fears over bobby in on the day of the the soviet champion simply did not
here something interesting from the review recipient name recipient email the armed forces are becoming bogged down in the battle for its elite special forces and an division are fighting to hold districts in the eastern outskirts of the city against by fighters using networks of tunnels to move about unseen in one day we lost dead and said a former senior adding that the forces had been caught by surprise by the extent of the tunnel system built by said to be miles long the service and the ninth division have been trying for two weeks to fight their way into that part of east of the river is sending waves of suicide bombers either as individuals who blow themselves up or in vehicles packed with snipers and mortar to restart the fighting in a dozen districts that the army had said were already captured at first i was optimistic that we might capture in two or three but i now believe it will take said a senior leader familiar with conditions in in an exclusive interview with the independent he said he had changed his mind about the likely length of the siege when he witnessed the ferocity of the fighting in the outer of he added that if they continue fighting like this then a lot of will be destroyed i hope it will not be like a prolonged siege of with heavy civilian casualties and the possibility of military intervention is likely to be the first international crisis to be faced by the incoming administration of trump the slow and advance of the armed forces into the city means that the attack will still be going on when he is inaugurated in on trump would have to decide if he is willing to sanction an escalation in to destroy though this would inevitably lead to heavy loss of life among the estimated million civilians in a threatened military intervention by turkey will also become more likely if the best combat units suffer heavy losses and look for reinforcements from the paramilitary forces and the under an these are being kept out of the city of itself to avoid sectarian and ethnic tensions between them and its population turkey has sent tanks to the border and said it may invade if the or fight inside the problem for the armed forces is that they have previously relied heavily on to destroy fighters in fixed positions there have been such in since in the battle for in some per cent of the city was but almost all of the population had fled and did not fight to the last man the same was true of the outer ring of towns around like and a dozen more miles from the which were empty of their largely making it easier to target and destroy from the air buildings held by the same tactics cannot be used in because its people are still there and the city is very big the government offensive that began on went well until it reached outskirts two weeks ago since then the fighting has swung backwards and forwards with districts being captured or recaptured three or four times in which the had entered on the elite soldiers later retreated and

by on future now rests in the hands of a man older than the supreme leader of celebrate in the streets of the coastal city of after election of former general as president the news come as much of a surprise in the end presidential posters with face were already being hung around east before the results had even been released but now its has finally elected a new a and former military was elected on making him the ending a political vacuum in the top post that had left now takes the reigns of a country heavily plagued by a massive refugee overload with refugees from various practically public constant threat of war from their southern and bomb attacks from terrorists interestingly this is the second time that has been announced the president to when he and the military government of east appointed itself in and anyone who dared disputed this was met with which did eventually occur even went on to fight a war of liberation against the army forces stationed in during which ended in failure and forced to flee his native land into exile in the man behind the poster is by his to be a strong leader with a military background who knows how to play the political field to achieve his goals on the other most i have spoken to about have offered plenty of negative feedback even from people who i assumed would throw their full support behind the old boy an overall slippery character who has been lucky enough to pick the right partners since his return to after his exile i have to the side of my personality that appreciates dark comedy chuckled at the picture of president sitting in the big chair of the presidential palace with just the slightest whisper of a cheeky smile on his face the last time held the the army under the authority of pictured at the presidential palace in being elected president of president of bombed him out in a attempt to illuminate a stubborn nationalist troublemaker yet years son of offered his personal congratulations to on his election victory just president also shares my dark which would explain his sly smirk while he sat in his prize seat despite all the he has returned to and claimed what he had always the presidency carries with him a considerable amount of political baggage from a long career full of civil war and side switching which has left many in questioning if this lord of war is the man worth appointing to end the political stalemate which some have suggested would be better off remaining politically frozen instead of appointing a man who has fought against the administration in during the late but now fully backs and in this is a totally understandable stance given the lack of honest candidates available in the fact remains that has been left completely disabled by the political deadlock which is pushing the country to the brink i personally agree with the progressive socialist party and leader who said on twitter prior to the vote that its time to elect any president to escape the presidential vacuum why elect i have a growing concern that behind closed doors some very egotistical and conniving millionaires are beginning to see the massive potential gas wealth just sitting off the coast but political class has been far too busy infighting among themselves to invest in steps towards harvesting and selling gas also have their eyes on this untapped wealth lying below the perhaps this could be why so many old adversaries of have decided to suddenly put an end to their refusal to back ally for who is smart enough to see this type of opportunity on the horizon and just about desperate enough to surrender his staunch opposition to candidacy in return for inclusion in any future plans given recent bad luck with his struggling business in i put it past him who is still eagerly perusing the trial and conviction of what he believes where who at news beside former prime minister after announced that he will back to become president assassinated his is now willing to throw his vote to candidate in order to secure the position for the second as prime minister certainly there are many more aspects to consider in what has been a leading up to yesterdays grand finale but i suspect that political godfathers are smart enough to realize they are sitting on a potential trillion dollar money maker is at risk of being high jacked if they continue pussyfooting around over never sectarian feuds what could during my last trip to i was shocked to see how even the average struggle with the lack of basic services the country is a mess and the only institution that is worth any praise is the army that has coped remarkably well under the strains of constant terror attacks from radical terrorists the rise of regional sectarianism and a huge lack of money equipment the proxy of dictator who fought a long bloody war against is now considered the candidate who confirms an political victory over its competitor for political influence in what has largely held the country back is the fact that has been stuck in a vicious game of between refusal to pick a side has left the country empty handed with no vision of a safe future has a desperately needed arms deal with a pathetic blaming the deal cancellation on a statement made by foreign minister happens to be who refused to accept a statement referring to as a terrorist group the produced statement patriarch president of also demanded all league members to condemn which both refused to do in previous attempts to remain has also refused to accept any or offers to provide free arms deliveries to the army in order not to upset the countries ties to the us or the gulf now that holds may have the guts to finally
for more information and media requests please contact or write to for media inquiries related to other independent human rights media unit the trade deal set to be signed by the union and is a fundamentally flawed treaty which should not be signed or ratified without a referendum in each country a united nations human rights expert says the independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international deplored the pressures brought on the regional parliament of which initially said it would not approve the treaty but later said its concerns had been met a culture of bullying and intimidation becomes apparent when it comes to trade agreements that currently get priority over human the expert said in his reports to the human rights council and general assembly has previously warned that is incompatible with the rule of democracy and human and substantiated how and why before the parliamentary assembly of the council of he believes that both and the trade and investment partnership currently being negotiated by the and the us give undue power to corporations at the expense of national governments and human and deplores that the mere existence of dispute settlement generates a regulatory chill the danger of and being signed and one day entering into force is so serious that every especially parliamentarians from member should now be given the opportunity to articulate the pros and cons the agenda gravely endangers health and other social and there is no justification to it said civil society should demand referendums on the approval of or any other such that has been negotiated behind closed he noted the expert said the should have heeded expert warnings and strong civil society opposition to his specific concerns include provisions which he says could hamper states regulatory powers and could allow investment companies to sue over legislation affecting even in cases where the laws were designed to protect workers public health or the environment states should not sign the agreement unless their powers to regulate and legislate in the public interest are fully safeguarded and the investment protection chapter is removed this chapter creates privileges for investors at the expense of the said noting that the new text may slightly amend this chapter but adding that the investment court system is similarly incompatible with the international covenant on civil and political which requires legal cases to be heard by independent public tribunals the associations of and judges have already decried this kind of dispute which is a and also discriminates against domestic is not necessary when all participating states are parties to the and already have public courts that are transparent and he said along with most trade and investment agreements is fundamentally flawed unless specific provision stipulates that the regulatory power of states is paramount and must not be impacted by a regulatory chill it must also be clear that in case of conflict between commercial treaties and human rights it is the latter that must prevail the expert said there was now a strengthened case for a legally binding instrument on corporate social obliging transnational corporations not to interfere in the internal affairs of and imposing sanctions when they pollute the environment or shift their profits into tax havens the human rights council has established an working group on transnational which is holding its second session this week who has participated in this working urges the prompt adoption of a treaty that makes the guiding principles on business and human rights legally binding and enforceable he also said it was time to discuss the secrecy surrounding the drawing up of the and the anomaly that much of the information about it became available only through in violation of state obligations to ensure open access to information the constitutionality of the and agreements should be tested before the court of justice in and the human rights aspects before the court of human which could be called upon to issue interim measures of said national courts should also test the compatibility of the agreements with national the independent expert stated there is a legitimate fear that will dilute environmental food and health and he said a treaty that strengthens the position of transnational corporations and monopolies at the expense of the public interest conflicts with the duty of states to protect all people under their jurisdiction from internal and external threats said the should have paid greater attention to a warning from a committee of members of parliament from the parliamentary assembly of the council of the committee on social health and sustainable development said earlier this month that imposed unacceptable restrictions on the legislative powers of national and called for the signing to be postponed note to the independent expert devoted his report to the human rights

secondary verification by key thoughts thoughts forwarded message at pm thoughts mills i have put together my thoughts on the campaign ideas and i have scheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better this is simply a draft but do let me know if this is a helpful process for you all thanks notes for a democratic campaign draft draft draft draft here are some comments and observations based on what we saw in the campaign if we get started we will be in a very strong position to execute well for structure and timing lets assume a total budget of about with more than paid employees and of volunteers the entire startup ceases operation four days after the structure includes a chairman or chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and a president who is the executive in charge of systems and building and managing the organization every day matters as our end date does not change an official campaign right after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best location the campaign headquarters will have about a thousand mostly young and hardworking and enthusiastic its important to have a very large hiring pool as or from which to choose smart and low paid permanent employees is a poor choice as its full of distractions and interruptions moving the location from elsewhere guarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help the key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work for you any outer borough of are all good examples of a blue state city to base in employees will relocate to participate in the and will find low cost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis this worked well in and can work elsewhere the computers will be in the cloud and most likely on amazon web services all the campaign needs are portable tablets and smart phones along with credit card readers the pieces of a campaign the field its important to have strong field with autonomy and empowerment operations talent needs to build the set up the hire the and administer what is about people initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states there is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the human systems the field is about organizing voter and get out the vote programs for organizing build a simple way to link people and activities as a and let the field manage the all cloud based build a simple organizing tool with a functioning avoid deep integration as the benefits are not worth it build on the cloud organizing is really about sharing and linking and this tool would measure and track all of it there are many other crucial early investments needed in the determining the precise list of battleground doing early polling to confirm initial and maintaining and extending voter protection programs at the state level the voter key is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates all that is known about them in smart phones will be used to and update profiles on the voter a dynamic volunteer can easily speak with a voter with their email or other digital get the voter videos and other answers to areas they care about benefits of to the scenario includes a volunteer on a walk encountering a potential updating the records real time and deepening contact with the voter and the information we have to offer digital a large group of campaign employees will use digital marketing methods to connect to to offer to use social networks to spread good and to raise money partners like blue state digital will do much of the fund raising a key point is to convert and other partners to pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load media and and polling new tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of earned and social media the impact of press coverage should be measurable in reach and and effectiveness measured by attention and other surveys build tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and and model how it works and who has the biggest impact tools can tell us about the origin of stories and the impact of any person or theme connect polling into this in some way find a way to do polling and not on phones analytics and data science and polling and resource optimization tools for each a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote analytics can model social factors and many other attributes of the needed voters modeling will tell us what who we need to turn out and and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches work well machine intelligence across the data should identify the most important factors for and preference it should be possible to link the voter records in van with upcoming databases from companies like and others for media measurement purposes the analytics tools can be built in house or partnered with a set of vendors core voter database and contact with voters the database of voters is a fine starting point for voter records and is maintained by the vendor needs to be converted to the the code developed for is unlikely to be and replaced by a model where the vendor data is kept in the van database and intermediate databases are arranged with additional information for a voter quite a bit of software is to be developed to

the hard working vs the government parasite by on which lifestyle choice produces better results being a hard working or being a government when you look at the hard numbers they may just surprise you in we deeply penalize hard work and we greatly reward government dependence if you live in a very liberal area of the country and you know how to game the it is entirely possible to live a comfortable existence without ever working too much at all in there are some that have been living off of government benefits for decades many of these people actually plan their lives around doing exactly what they need to do to qualify for as many benefits as possible is rapidly turning into a socialist welfare state and it is destroying our nation socially and financially ever since the war on poverty began our debt has absolutely exploded and yet now there are more poor people in this country than ever before obviously something is not working now get me wrong i deeply believe in having compassion for those that are going through tough times and having a safety net for those that cannot take care of themselves we should not have a single person in this nation going without food or sleeping in the streets but in today it is absolutely ridiculous how many people are climbing aboard the safety net at this an astounding percent of all live in a home that receives some form of government benefits so who pays for all of the people that drag themselves out of bed and go to work each day pay for it all for a few lets examine how the lifestyle of a typical hard working compares to the lifestyle of a government parasite in the median yearly household income is somewhere around about half of all households make more than that and about half of all households make less than that when you break it it comes to about a month so how far does go in it go very far at all first of a hard working family will need some place to live the vast majority of the decent jobs are near the big and it is more expensive to live near the big cities lets assume that an average family of four will spend about a month on rent or on a mortgage payment the government on the other has a whole host of state and local housing programs to take advantage of during the recent economic more than ever have been turning to the government for help with housing costs for federal housing assistance outlays increased by a whopping percent between and once you have a place to you have to provide power and heat for it for the average hard working this is going to probably average about a although this can vary greatly depending on where you live for the government there are once again a whole host of government programs to help with this for income home energy assistance assists low income households in paying their home heating bills most average hard working are also going to need phone and service lets assume that the hard working family of four in our example is extremely thrifty and only spends a month for these services for the government cell phone service is not a problem as i have written about previously those that qualify can receive a free cell phone and free cell phone minutes every single month from the federal government in in some areas of the nation low income families can qualify for deeply subsidized home service in order to earn our hard working family is going to need to get to work in most both parents have decided to work these days so both of them will need cars lets assume that the family is very thrifty and that both cars were purchased used and that the car payments only total about a month the hard working family will also need auto insurance for the two vehicles lets assume that both parents have a great driving record and that they only pay a total of about a month for car insurance the cars will also need to be filled up with gasoline the average u s household spent on gasoline during but lets assume that our family is very careful and that they only spend about on gas each month so what about the government the government parasite does not need to go to so this expense can potentially be eliminated entirely but since most other things are paid for by the government or are deeply in many instances government parasites are actually able to afford very nice vehicles in a new bill gasoline assistance program has been introduced in congress that would give qualifying households money to help pay for gasoline assistance program act directs the secretary of health and human services to make grants to states to establish emergency assistance programs to pay eligible households for the purchase of gasoline a hard working family is also going to need health insurance we all know how expensive health insurance has become in health insurance costs have risen by percent since became president but lets assume that our hard working family has somehow been able to find an amazing deal where they only pay a month for health insurance for a family of four for the government health insurance is not needed if there is an the government parasite can just go get free medical care at any emergency room and of course there is always back in only one out of every was on one out of every is on and things are about to get a whole lot worse it is being projected that will add million more to the rolls so what about everyone has to the hard working family in our example is faced with an environment where food prices are constantly rising but paychecks
