email it was years or so when a classmate at bard college insisted that i read a short story by babel titled the reserve cavalry commander that he described to me as a cossack soldier miraculously bringing a moribund horse to its feet the red cavalry title of babels collection of short stories written when the and former was with had been confiscating peasant horses during the civil war and trading in nags ridden to exhaustion on the battlefield for fresh ones for the backward this was the sort of intrusion that would become the straw that broke the camels back in about a being forced into collective farms like recalcitrant horses drove them into open revolt for the time they were inclined to tolerate the communists who at least had come to power on the promise of bread and land it was the assault on the land that for the time being assuaged the peasants responding to an aggrieved the eponymous reserve cavalry commander who was a former circus rider described by babel as with a gray a black and wide red trousers with silver promised that he could make this lively little mare spring to her feet again the idea that the horse splayed out on the ground could be described as lively was almost an insult the cried lord in heaven and mother of god how is this poor thing supposed to get its on its last ability to bring the horse back on its feet was like raising from the dead but all the more miraculous since it likely occurred most of babels short stories were based on his experience as a war correspondent he you are insulting this my dear answered with fierce conviction pure my dear and he deftly swung his athletes body out of his saddle splendid and deft as if in the circus he stretched his magnificent his trousers girded by cords around the and walked up to the dying animal she peered at him dolefully with a penetrating licked some invisible command from his crimson and immediately the feeble mare felt bracing power flow from this blossoming romeo her muzzle her legs skidding under feeling the whip tickling her stomach with imperious the mare slowly and rose onto her legs and then we all saw slender hand with its fluttering sleeve run through her dirty and his whining whip swatting her bleeding ranks her whole body the mare stood on four legs without moving her lovestruck eyes from so you is a said to the and added and you were my dearest of throwing his reins to his the commander of the reserve cavalry jumped the four stairs in a single leap swirling off his operatic disappeared into the headquarters reading this story once again for the first time in i am reminded of how important babel was to me at the time like and he was a portal into the world of modernist literature that still had an immense attraction for young bohemians in the early i never thought once about who babel was or anything about the social reality he was trying to depict all that mattered to me was babels prose that could evoke the mysterious power of a cossack resurrecting a dying horse my early connections to modernism and my later connections to that superseded it and just about all the other intellectual baggage i carried around with me from the early converged as i watched a press screening of finding babel that opens on 28 th at the cinema village in new directed by who has a background as a sound it is a film that will be of great interest to those whose appreciation of babel is strictly literary as was mine long ago and to those trying to come to terms with the soviet legacy given the prominence of today as a possible trigger of according to babels multiple identity as communist and critic of soviet deficiencies is worth pondering the film is structured around the odyssey conducted by who is the grandson of babel and an acting professor in the theater department of the new college of to see where his grandfather lived and to speak with people who knew him or who have studied or been inspired by his work babel was executed for treason in having been charged with belonging to a group and spying for and babels wife who died at the age of 101 in is interviewed in the film and provides much of the information about babels personality and his travails as a dissident after her husbands arrest in the soviet cops told her to forget about him and to regulate her life according to the new times obituary she was formidable in her own right with her engineering she helped to design the subway system the obit ms recalled babels dismay at her haphazard reading which he tried to correct by drawing up a list of the hundred books that every educated person needs to read it included a volume titled the instincts and morals of insects she recounted evenings spent with soviet cultural giants like the film director m and visits by foreign luminaries like and it was babels mistake apparently to adhere to the values of the original revolution rather than to fall in line as a toady as he travels around encounters intellectuals and ordinary people who revere babel as one of their own especially for another collection of short stories that is as highly regarded as red cavalry written in 1923 and the stories focus on gangsters living in an hardly the material expect to find written by a partisan of the revolution but certainly in keeping with the original inspiration of soviet culture that conformed to homo a me or i am and nothing of that which is human is alien to me although i have never read i plan to as soon as i find the time since it is about the same sort of characters my grandfather probably knew in and who like him escaped pogroms by emigrating to the unlike my grandfather who made a life out of building hotels in county in upstate kid twist and other members of murder incorporated only saw the borscht belt as a place where they could dump their victims in swan about fifteen minutes from my home town throughout the film we hear brief excerpts from both collections narrated by that will be a good introduction to babels literary power there are also interviews with some leading babel scholars including professor who spent a day traveling around with to see places where babel lived for a few years before returning to we learn that although he could have avoided becoming one of countless victims by living in he was too attached to culture and language to live abroad while in babel wrote a play titled maria that likely put him on although being a intellectual and artist might have condemned from the start with his theater is ideally suited to discuss the play with fellow thespians including marina an acclaimed who reads a letter from the titular character in mounted a production of maria at university the plays program describes major character a as a symbol of capitalist rationality while the eponymous maria epitomized the pure romance of the revolution like the young served in the red cavalry never seen on we only hear from maria indirectly as her letter is recited by another character in scene five it at dawn the bugle from squadron headquarters wakes me by eight i have to be in the political propaganda in charge edit the articles of the divisional i run the literacy classes our reinforcements are all they remind me of the way they talk and act has been suppressing and destroying their culture for centuries in our house in opposite the hermitage and the winter we might as well have been living in for we knew any thing at all about our it is writing lines like this that got babel killed rather than spying for or babel was a friend and of maxim who remained a despite sharing babels inclination for writing about the lower depths of society he was deeply troubled by how maria depicted political prosecution of the and black within soviet society accused babel of having a predilection for rotting meat apparently had forgotten that was favorite novelist the director of finding babel has a connection to but not to its legendary gangsters he has an ancestor named who wrote liturgical music for a synagogue there in an interview given to the review sums up babels relationship to the soviet experience that resonates with my own on the left as someone with roots in the existential outsider world of the that saw as its most eloquent i never found myself comfortable with the milieu that fostered obedience to the genius leader to this it has been these youthful affinities with outsider culture that makes it difficult for me to join any amen chorus on the left even though it is the left that remains my homeland i think that description of babels sensibility can help me preserve my sanity in a period of deep contradictions within the babel represented the insider thats what he was he got himself all the way up to the upper levels of the up to who ended up supervising his torture in the personally i know if he was in the but he had an office in the st monastery where babel was tortured that monastery was being used as a torture the which we note in the we visited it he got himself as close to the flame as possible as an but yet he was an outsider because he was from he was he should not even have been permitted to study under which is where he really honed his skills the only reason that he was able to study under is that he smuggled himself illegally to st when he allowed to be because it was outside the settlement area for so babel was an outsider he then found himself with red calvary with the cossacks in the red running through western as he documented brutality against the and the brutality brought on by both it was a civil war essentially between the reds and the poles who suffered the the and the the peasantry are the ones who suffered the most in that conflict there he was the outsider insider its from this very unique perspective where all his writing came from

other writers if becomes expect disaster if trump is he will have to be smarter than in order to survive never before in history has a presidential candidate been surrounded by so many implacable enemies baying for his blood by the saker the united states is about to enter what might possibly be the deepest and most dangerous crisis of its history maybe trump will be the guy to bring down the empire in order to save the united states the saker watching the last presidential debate was a rather depressing experience i thought that trump did pretty but that really is not the point here the point is no matter who an acute crisis is inevitable option one wins would be on steroids only worse remember that himself was only worse of was just only worse now the circle is closed back to except this time we have a woman who is deeply who failed at every single thing that she every tried to and who now has a three decades long record of disasters and failures even when she had no authority to start a she started one bill to bomb the now she has that authority and now she had to stand in front of millions of and hear trump tell her outsmarted you at every step of the way did you see her frozen face when he said trump is right did outsmart her and at every step the problem is that after having a president with an inferiority complex towards we will have a president with the very same inferiority complex and a morbid determination to impose a zone over forces in looking at with her ugly short hair and ridiculous i thought to myself this is a woman who is trying hard to prove that she is every bit as tough as any man except of course that she her record also shows her as being cowardly and with a sense of total impunity and that evil messianic lunatic with a inferiority complex is going to become commander in god help us option trump wins trump will be completely alone the have repeat total control of the the banking and and the courts from to they have deeply infiltrated the foggy and the three letter agencies the fed is their stronghold how in the world will trump deal with these rabid crazies in the basement consider the vicious hate campaign which all these personalities actors to politicians to have unleashed against trump they have burned their they know that they will lose it all if trump wins if he proves to be an easy pushover his election will make no difference the have nothing to lose and they will fight to the very last one what could trump possibly do to get anything done if he is surrounded by and their agents of bring in an entirely different how is he going to vet his first choice was to take pence as a a disaster is already sabotaging trump on and the elections i dread to hear whom trump will appoint as a white house chief of staff as i am afraid that just to appease the he will appoint some new version of the infamous and should trump prove that he has both principles and the can always him and replace him with pence et i see only one way the model when came to power he inherited a every bit as corrupt and as the white house nowadays as for she was in pretty much the same sorry shape as the independent was also run by bankers and puppets and most led miserable lives the big difference is unlike what is happening with the version of the us never saw the danger coming from he was selected by the ruling elites as the representative of the security services to serve along a representative of the big corporate this was a compromise solution between the only two parts of the society which were still the security services and money looked like a petty bureaucrat in an ill fitting a shy and somewhat awkward little guy who would present no threat to the powerful oligarchs of the seven running except that he turned out to be one of the most formidable rulers in history here is what did as soon as he came to he the credibility of the with the armed forces and security services by rapidly and effectively crushing the insurgency in this established his personal credibility with the people he would have to rely on to deal with the oligarchs he used the fact that every single businessman and corporation in did more or less break the law during the if only because there really was no law instead of cracking down on the likes of or for their political he crushed them with charges of corruption he did that very sending a clear message to the other the media contrary to the hallucinations of the western human rights agencies and never directly suppressed any or cracked down on the media even less ordered the murder of anybody he did something much smarter remember that modern journalists are first and foremost by mercilessly cracking down on the oligarchs deprived the of their source of income and political support some emigrated to the others simply and a few were left like on a reservation or a zoo on a few very clearly identifiable media outlets such as radio or the newspaper those who emigrated became irrelevant as for those who stayed in the liberal they were harmless and they had no credibility left everybody else got the message after all it took is the appointment a few real patriots as margarita and in key positions and everybody quickly understood that the winds of fortune had now turned once the main media outlets were returned back to sanity it did not take too long for the liberal the meaning parties to enter into a from which they have never recovered in resulted in the ejection of all liberals form the which now has only 4 all of them more or less patriotic and the are very different and no recipe can simply be copied from one to another there are valuable lessons from the model for not the least of which that his most formidable enemies probably are sitting in the fed one analyst has suggested that trump could somehow force the fed to increase interest which would result in a bankruptcy domino effect for us banks which might be the only way to finally crush the fed and control of us banking what achieved of brooms and body parts used to say the soviet needed to be cleansed from anarchists and noblemen with an iron broom he even wrote an article in the entitled we need an iron broom another genocidal founder of the notorious secret used to say that a secret police officer must have a burning a cool head and clean hands one would seek or even in vain from folks like these these are true sociopaths with no sense of profoundly evil people with a genocidal hatred of anybody standing in their way and her gang of are the spiritual sometimes even successors of the soviet and just like their will not hesitate for a second to crush their enemies trump assuming he is for real and actually means what he says has to understand that and do what strike first and strike hard by the also did exactly and for a while the were but in the years following death they gradually bounced back only to seize power again in 1991 i think that the jury is still out on whether will succeed in finally removing the 5th columnists from power what is sure is that is at least from the control of and that the us is their last bastion right now their maniacal hatred of trump can in part be explained by the sense of danger being threatened for the first time in what they see as i mean that in a patriotic sense but rather like a parasite cares for his host and maybe have some good reason to fear i sure hope that they do inserted by i am rather encouraged by the way trump handled the latest attempt to make him cower in fear yesterday trump dared to declare that since the election might be rigged or stolen he does not pledge to recognize their outcome and even though every person knows that elections in the have been rigged and stolen in the including presidential by saying that trump committed a major case of the pounced on him with outrage and put immense pressure on him to retract his statement instead of rolling over and recanting his trump refused to do so beautiful lets hope he continues to show the same courage trump is now doing what pen did in he is showing the that he dares to openly defy that he refuses to play by their that their outrage has no effect on him and that they get to censor or silence him that is also what he did yet he refused to accuse the of repeated that it would be a good thing for and the to be friends i am not sure that how long he will be able to hold that but for the time being there is no denying that he is openly defying the deep state and empire conclusion the united states is about to enter what might possibly be the deepest and most dangerous crisis of its history if trump is he will have to immediately launch a attack against his opponents without giving them any pretext to accuse him of politically motivated repressions in could count on the support of the military and the security services i know whom trump can count but i am fairly confident that there are still true patriots in the us armed forces if trump gets the right person to head the he might also use that agency to clean house and deliver a steady streams of indictments for conspiracy to the abuse of obstruction of justice and dereliction of etc since such crimes are widespread in the current circles of they are also easy to prove and cracking down on corruption would get trump a standing ovation from the people just as in trump will have to deal with the media how i know but he will have to face this beast and defeat it at every step in this process he will have to get the proactive support of the just like does can he do i know i doubt it i still trust him more i would argue that to overthrow the deep state and restore true people power is even harder in the than it was in i have always believed that the empire will have to be brought down from the most probably by a combination of military and economic defeats i still believe that i might be wrong in i hope that i am and maybe trump will be the guy to bring down the empire in order to save the united states if there is such a however i think that we have to believe in it and act on it as all the alternatives are far worse source like share it now 3 thoughts on 27 am of all the articles written on the imbroglio and the dangers that face after the 8 this is the most outstanding i have read so far it offers a neat summation of what will happen if things will get worse than they have ever been before and then spiral out of with world war three almost given the mental instability and sheer malignancy of this female monster from hell if trump the article spells out in detail the formidable challenges that would face him far greater in magnitude and number than the challenges facing when he came to power in in 1991 to succeed against his implacable enemies the establishment to quote the saker trump would have to possess the fighting spirit and unique skills of even his most ardent admirers cannot possibly believe

from monster to democrats grovel before trump by 2016 information clearing house within a day of the election of leading democrats have moved with extraordinary speed to declare their support for the invited trump to the white house for a friendly meeting on he declared afterwards that his priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our is successful he speaking to i want to emphasize to that we now are going to want to do everything we can to help you if you then the country declaration stands in stark contrast to his own statements just a few days ago then he asserted that trump appears to only care about himself and know basic facts that need to know to be president he added that trump spent 70 years on this earth showing no regard for working was before the democratic debacle on election day now he declares his highest priority to be ensuring that trump is comments followed the statement by on that she hoped will be a successful president for all senator the supposed issued his own groveling to the degree that trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this i and other progressives are prepared to work with such the democrats are in effect abandoning any pretense of acting as an opposition party to a president trump and a proclamations of support from top democrats are made in relation to an individual whose election clearly marks a watershed in politics what is coming to power is a government of the extreme with fascistic characteristics there are reports that trump wants to appoint as his chief of staff the head of an and fascistic media outlet his top advisors and likely cabinet appointees include reactionary figures such as former new mayor and new jersey governor their rush to lend the transition of power an aura of the democrats and the media have maintained a studious silence about certain quite striking elements of the one is noting that a principal factor in the election of trump was a significant decline in voter turnout for all of the media talk of a surge of white working class voters behind the republican candidate actually received one million fewer votes than mitt received in losing the 2012 election to won 6 million fewer votes than won in his when the outgoing president obtained significantly fewer votes than he had received in 2008 also virtually ignored is the extraordinary fact that trump failed even to win the popular vote had a higher percentage of the national but she lost in the electoral which involves a complex and antidemocratic apportionment based on victories in individual states trump will take office having failed to secure a let alone a of the overall the entire history of the united there have been only five elections in which the incoming president did not win the popular vote when this happened in the b became though he had fewer votes than the j the political conflict over the outcome was so intense that the republicans were able to hold the white house only after agreeing to the effective end of war through the withdrawal of federal troops from the a split vote in when grover lost to the winner of the electoral vote was also the winner of the popular vote for the next 112 years in the 21st this anomaly has now happened 2000 and again in 2016 in the former the selection of w bush as president required the intervention of the supreme court to halt the recount of ballots in trump found himself in the position of he would have taken his time before conceding his concession when and if it would have stressed that he had won the popular vote and that crooked could not claim a media message would have stressed the need for to be conciliatory and acknowledge that the majority of the voters had chosen trump one can easily imagine announcing the breaking news that had withdrawn the nomination of choice for the supreme court and invited the republicans to name the replacement for the deceased the democrats have done just the is behind this universal president said perhaps more than he intended when he declared that we have to remember that were actually all on one team this is an intramural a test competition involving players from the same united states does not really have an oppositional political system the divisions between the democrats and and between and are of an entirely tactical character they all defend the same basic of the corporate and financial aristocracy that controls the political this the democrats are always the more accommodating and conciliatory since their rhetorical references to defending the interests of working by the likes of thoroughly vacuous and insincere in relation to trump and the dangers he there is an element of complete which arises from the fact that the danger is not to the democrats or the privileged social forces for which they but to the working chief concern of the democrats is to contain popular anger their moves to circle the wagons around trump are above all a response to the danger they see of the emergence of popular opposition that threatens not only the incoming but the capitalist system as sanders and company prostrate themselves and pledge their loyalty to thousands of youth and workers are demonstrating around the country against the these protests are only a pale and politically disparate foretaste of mass struggles of the working class that are to is critical is that the lessons of the 2016 election be drawn and all attempts to keep opposition to war and austerity chained to the political corpse of the democratic party be rejected the task is not to take back the democratic party or push it to the inevitable result of that false perspective has already been demonstrated in the reactionary outcome of the sanders to break with both parties of big business and all forms of capitalist politics and build an independent socialist and internationalist movement of the working

by brushing away the extreme claims and rhetoric of much election there are some observations which deserve attention these unfortunately mostly provide hard lessons and not a lot of encouragement for people who hold to principles of and the election demonstrated perhaps better than and better than has been generally been that a plutocracy it took a genuine a a man with a lifetimes economic to defeat a family which could provide the very definition of being politically a family which had laboriously constructed and carefully maintained a kind of deep well with money for their ambitions it was the well of drilled by bill with help from some extremely shady such as that made the keystone establishment figures in the democratic party it was not personal charm or exceptional political in his displayed some of both of earned the their it was the the mothers milk of politics in what is euphemistically called fund many hundreds of millions of dollars were provided for the party over the last couple of decades by bill efforts fully appreciated the fact that money buys power and influence she lacked bills superficial but she certainly more than shared his ambition on the charm when she was ready to move into running for she perhaps under bills a kind of forced clown face with arched and a smile as big as her lips would and these expressions were accompanied by little gestures such as briefly pointing to various or waving whenever she campaigned her gestures reminded me of something you might see atop a float in a parade or of the late at his most exuberant these were not natural for her they were never in evidence years ago when she spent years as a kind of bizarre executive both in a governors mansion and later in the white bizarre because she indulged her husbands predatory sexual behavior in exchange for the immense power it conferred on her behind the scenes over her far more and successful knew that gestures and simulated charm do not get you far in politics she determined to build a political war chest long and there are many indications over the years of her working towards this end of making this or that change in expressed as when running for the when sources of big money suggested another view would more acceptable she was anything but constant in the views she embraced because when she ran for the senate she spent record amounts of embarrassingly large amounts in her years of speaking she aimed at special interests who could supply potentially far more money than just exorbitant speaking fees in the appointed post of secretary of as it into personal contact with every head of government or international unquestionably played an aggressive pay for play with them all covering up that embarrassing and illegal fact is what the private servers and unauthorized smart phones were all about a second big fact of the election is that both major political parties are rather sick and fading the republican party has been broken for a very long time it hobbled along for some decades with the help of various hoping to expand its constituency with rubbish like family public prayer and catering to the and burning constitutional and now it is truly out of gas that is precisely why a political outsider like oligarch trump could manage to hijack the party he was opposed by boring men like seeking to secure an almost inherited and a intensely phony fundamentalist like and it proved to be no contest it was a remarkable political but i think it was only possible given the sorry state of the party the republican party had been given a some new by in the he had an extremely mixed record as but he was held in some and did have a clear but his effect on the party was not lasting trump could be seen as another but i think the comparison is superficial trump literally hijacked the and he was not deliriously crowned by its establishment the press was too busy attacking him from the start to take notice or do any intelligent and he was attacked precisely for the potential damage to the establishment he represented his most promising quality is his potential for creating a new coalition of interests and one excluding the continuation of the wars vigorously embraced and would expand but the democratic party is in serious too it has a great deal of internal as the material from the clearly shows us lack of ignorance of the people it has always claimed to bad and the absolute prostrate worship of money are the major symptoms the material tells us about many internal including harsh judgments of resentment over the character of daughter who is said to resemble in her behavior and and the belief of some that just should not have run she had become for many a rather figure from whom absolutely nothing spectacular in politics or policy could possibly be expected but they not only blindly supported they broke all their own party rules by internally and secretly working to defeat a legitimate and viable sanders sanders might well have been able to win the election for the but their establishment was blind to the possibility and rejected his candidacy after there were bill and beckoning to their running well of money in it might be just as well that sanders was cheated out of the nomination he proved a weak individual in the giving in to just the forces he had claimed to oppose and leaving his enthusiastic followers completely let down he may well even have been secretly bribed by money from the since he bought a fairly expensive property not long afterward in any there he out on the supporting everything he ever opposed personified in men of that nature do not stand up well to generals and admirals and the heads of massive a quality which i do think we have some right to expect trump to display another important fact about the election is that it was less the triumph of trump than the avoidance of that caused the defeat the numbers are unmistakable trump did well for a political newcomer and a very controversial but simply did not approaching the support achieved in key again something reflecting the documented fact that she is not a figure and the party blundered badly in running her but money and the particularly are the biggest they have had in our lifetime no one was ready to say no to the source of all that money to many the election result must seem a bit like having experienced something of a although a revolution conducted through any other kind being literally impossible by design in this massive state in a it does represent something of a revolutionary owing to the fact that trump the oligarch is in his political views a bit of a revolutionary or at least a dissenter from the prevailing establishment views as in any even a small there are going to be some unpleasant outcomes the historical truth of politics is that you never know from just what surprising source change may come crooked politician and the main author of the horrifying and pointless did more for the rights of black than any other modern president franklin son of wealthy establishment provided remarkable leadership in the great restoring hopes and dreams for millions never comes from establishments or institutions like political parties it always comes from unusual people who seem to step out of their accustomed roles in life with some good or inspired ideas and have the drive and toughness to make them a reality i have some limited but important hopes for trump i am not blind or delirious expecting miracles from this unusual and after the experience of who seemed such a promising young figure but fairly quickly proved a bloody i can never build up substantial hopes for any politician and what was the choice was a ticket to hell trump offers two areas of some and these both represent real change the first is in reducing close to military aggressiveness abroad this reflecting momentum from what can only be called the continued and grew under the weak and ineffectual leadership of and was boosted and encouraged by as secretary of state the feminists who weep for her should be did a lot of killing during her tenure she along with are literally responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of women and their many of them literally torn apart by bombs the other area of some hope is for the welfare of ordinary people themselves who have been completely ignored by national leaders for decades lame reaction to hurricane he was internationally shamed into some has become the normal pattern for national government when it comes to ordinary the truth is that the legacy of has withered to nothing and no longer plays any role in the democratic and of course never did in the republican party by i do not mean the kind of state assistance that bill himself worked to end nothing can impress someone not familiar with dark corners more than a visit to places like or or south parts of new or or dozens of other places where live in conditions in every way comparable to third world hellholes i mean the peoples general trumps approach will be through jobs and creating incentives for jobs i know whether he can just as he asked people in some of his what do you have to just having someone in power who pays any attention to the is a small gain people should never think of the as liberal or and that was just as much true for bill as it is for his record as from his embarrassing behavior in the oval office with a young female intern and his recruitment of secret service guards as procurers for women he found attractive on his morning actually pretty appalling in his own ended welfare as we know it he signed legislation which would send large numbers of young black men to prison he also signed legislation which contributed to the later financial collapse under bush he often would appoint someone decent and then quickly back leaving them when it looked like approval for the appointment would not be coming his

the 2016 parliamentary elections provide a preview of what to expect in 2018 and to what extent were the 2016 parliamentary elections fair and in your in they were juridically legitimate because they were conducted in accordance with law the degree of the not juridical legitimacy is a debatable question because of the low it means that the representation of citizens in the parliament became even less than previously about of the population voted at the elections though the united ruling party garnered four million fewer votes than during the 2011 it received more seats in the parliament in liberal politicians are not included in the parliament at all the legitimacy of the elections is a matter of these elections were fair in the polling stations with to a large extent they were honest in the in which the central election commission controlled the electoral process in cooperation with observers a lesser these elections were fair and transparent in the distant regions or in the words of prominent political expert zones of peculiar electoral which saw an abnormally high electoral turnout i for the republic of in southern the north region etc regions were controlled by the central election commission to a much lesser extent no wonder that people were compelled to vote in accordance with the orders of local authorities the violations in these regions were likely to be common associate and chair of the domestic politics and political institutions program at the center press photo does central election commission have any tools to influence voting in the distant there are some but local authorities limit and restrict them i think the administration of the president hampered the work of the central election commission she tried to balance the interests of president and the interests of the civil society is the position and it is very difficult she just tried to take into account all positions and signals that were coming from the regions during the electoral campaign and could not ignore them there were so many of these signals that she objectively and physically could not control the throughout the in the distant regions what kinds of violations took place during the 2016 if violations took even though they were not like previously during the 2011 elections these violations included the use of administrative resources for rigged and fabricated stuffing the ballot and dirty political techniques against the liberal and communist parties during the political campaign and before election day was also orchestrated when students and governmental employees were ordered to vote this also should be taken into account all these violations took place not only in distant but also in those under the steady control of the central election why did the united party win despite its declining popularity throughout the fact the united won the majority in the state and the popularity are basically different things its popularity has been decreasing indeed it is one reality but it prevent the party from winning most of the seats that is the other reality citizens see the party as a body that deals with the problems of the population the credibility and approval rankings of almost all governmental except law enforcement agencies and the president are dropping and united is not the because people perceive it not as a but as a kind of a governmental body its rating will keep going but step by step if you vote for united it means a symbolic a sort of political ritual if you are and go to the polling you are likely to vote for united because it is necessary this is the very logic and motivation that drive average voters to elect united though some people preferred not to vote for the ruling they voted for the current because there were no real they voted either for one of the three systemic parliamentary parties or the spoiler which aimed at distracting the attention of voters and preventing the opposition from gaining parliamentary seats why did the opposition fail and what is its key the reason why they failed can be traced back to the personal ambitions of the opposition leaders they team up and compete with each other in they have different in fact i mean liberals and liberals always agree this does after all these leaders have enough political heft most of them cannot be considered powerful and influential political figures problem is that the authoritarian regime in will prevent the emergence of new powerful liberal forces in if such a party emerges and poses a serious challenge to the authorities like opposition leader it will be either destroyed or discredited and marginalized in such a it is very difficult to come up with a pragmatic solution this years parliamentary elections proved that the only political democratic force on a scale of a whole country is the party and its leader no matter how you view them it is losing popularity year after but this party remains firmly within the political landscape and if the opposition is able to persuade voters that brings together different representatives of liberal and democratic forces as well as they might succeed in the future but in reality its hardly probable you said that the would prevent the emergence of a new powerful liberal political force in because the existence of such a force contradicts the nature of the authoritarian regime yet why are the authorities afraid of everything that is associated with if those within the are pretty if their approval rankings are high among the majority of if people trust liberals and the idea of liberalism is totally discredited in the it is a matter of the logic of development of any authoritative regime it adds up to total political control in the authorities are not so confident that they are so popular among the as implied by the words of president who came to the united headquarters after the elections and said despite economic challenges and the difficult people voted for united if you read between the you can detect the feeling of the lack of confidence means that the social contract economic in exchange for political freedoms restrict your political but feed you work anymore and might be not so relevant thats why the authorities find it necessary to feed people with imperial and increase political control and establish a political which also means creating fake liberal parties such as the party of growth after it is a good example of the spoiler artificial party created within the test tube and this control is likely to persist as long as this regime exists what will the 2016 parliamentary elections change in there wont be big changes these elections aimed at preparing the groundwork for the 2018 presidential elections and testing current political system and in this this task was fulfilled by 2018 is going to look for new faces and figures to renew his but this is going to be a different political even though it is partly related to the parliamentary elections you said the 2016 parliamentary elections were a proving ground for the 2018 presidential elections and tested current political system could you be more these elections confirmed the legitimacy of the current authorities once the sees that it does have the mandate to rule the country himself does have this because the ruling party is associated with his and the political unity is based on the narrative and the parliament itself system passed the test successfully it can work for a certain period of time as long as everybody is satisfied with this model the system is ready to live for another 18 months until the 2018 presidential with the parliament organically embedded in this system and ready to fulfill blindly all orders from the president other question is how will these elections be conducted in terms of obvious predictability and the absolute absence of interest toward them given the fact that nobody can compete with in he is the only candidate who will win there is the lack of motivation for voters to come to the polling stations in 2018 do you mean that the turnout at the presidential election will be the turnout is going to be the key question in the 2018 election is a referendum that will test the credibility and approval of one person in this the authorities have to create an artificial rivalry to but it is hardly likely to work the real rival wont be allowed to compete with if we are talking about if is once again elected there is no motivation to vote the other as indicated by this years parliamentary those who came to the polling stations observed a sort of political ritual it is a matter of carrying out a commitment and this might drive people to vote in many regions and have an impact on the electoral turnout i expect it to be lower than during the parliamentary especially in and st the turnout will be low not because people do not trust it will be low because of the absolute predictability of the because of the absence of competition to what extent were this years parliamentary elections different from the ones in 2011 and why they lead to protests the situations are totally different in people were waiting for changes and the continuation of with urbanites frustrated by the rigged voting and obvious violations during the parliamentary elections they were also disappointed with the presidential when then president decided not to stand for the 2012 presidency and let come to power once depriving them of the opportunity of a choice they took to the streets their protests failed to bring changes among the authorities these protests brought about a series of which had a chilling effect on the protesters the authorities took very repressive legal measures including the law that bans foreign families from adopting the laws that restrict the right to organize laws on foreign agents and undesirable and other restrictive measures by the beginning of this years people had been very discouraged they believe that they could change something they were not ready to take to the streets they were totally apathetic and disappointed politically on top of there was the incorporation of this narrative played its role in bringing people together around the read decoding social transformations in those who took to the streets in 2011 supported incorporation it is difficult to make any yet the correlation does exist helped to mobilize even part of the citizens it became the key narrative that mobilized the nation those who support the incorporation of are seen as outcasts they are considered to be outsiders how long will the effect be able to unite people around the it is difficult to say for sure the abrupt worsening of living standards and drop in income might influence the behavior of the population yet this is just a because people are still very satisfied with return to they see themselves as being part of a great power to the polls of the people are still supporting the foreign they want the sanctions to be and they believe they are above these sanctions they think that should keep the policy instead of trying to persuade the west to lift these sanctions this mobilization being in the state of helps them to deal with the economic crisis and adjust to it there are no signs of political which means that people wont orchestrate political protests shortly after the parliamentary media reported about the plans to create the ministry of state security in the which is expected to bring together all law security agencies it seems to be a reanimated version of the old what does it mean for political law enforcement officers play today a significant role the if these plans come it means that the authorities are trying to hedge political it is a matter of the system defending itself in advance one of the goals the is to provide security for the president and this problem will be more relevant by the end of the state by because it will be the time when the future of will be determined there will be the questions from people and political elites if will remain at the helm after 2024 or if he will nominate his successor or if he will be a lame duck or not all these questions need to be clarified and to feel more confident and he needs absolute control and the creation of such a monstrosity like the is quite logical in such a situation but this leak about was no more than proving public and elites opinions right now this body will not be created there is some speculation that might be concerned with a plot prepared by some members of political elite is it really the in today there are not any signs of a conspiracy against the stakeholders within the political elites are not interested in given a great deal of solidarity and unity around the narrative even though is autocratic in his nevertheless he is very popular among the elites he builds such a political machine that guarantees him security and prevents any possibility of a coup yet recently reshuffled his political deck and asked his chief of a former to resign who was seen by some experts as a political unknown and a neutral technocratic political replaced does this resignation mean that hedges the risks and just wants to get rid of those who might compete with this is the which means the 2018 new team of the president will consist of absolutely loyal who will be distant from the leader and wont have any claims for power this is in contrast to cronies governmental oligarchs and his close friends team will also comprise the bureaucrats and average men from law enforcement including security guards and representatives of the special services this is how sees effective this is how he is going to reform the governance system this is part of his strategy to save his personal security during his next presidential term these people will have to provide with security when he either retires or hands over power to his is an observer he is like a that takes into account all views and tries to balance there is also speculation that is trying to fuel an artificial rivalry between different law enforcement agencies to strengthen his positions in the do you it is the case the logic of the is to control this watch over it closely and make it more transparent within one big entity after is an observer he is like a that takes into account all views and tries to balance them he gives them room to compete with each other up to a point and makes certain conclusions it is a matter of effective political management at the chairman of the investigative committee he has been very influential until but he started expressing political claims and got in trouble 2016 the federal security service conducted a series of inspections in the investigative committees offices and arrested officials suspected of corruption and embezzlement editors need independent and very corrupt figures he is ready to put up with the riches of his governmental but as long as they can hide it and fulfill their commitments within their governmental corporations is creating the environment that can provide him with security and insurance and control the wars with the inner circle political elites have already received a lot of signals from if somebody behaves in a wrong he will be either dismissed or accused of how do you see the role of given that he has acquired the reputation of a very weak and docile to what extent does he fit into the his weakness is his power his purposefully technocratic nature is his competitive capability he is docile he is between the loyal systemic liberals and law enforcement officials in his informal agreement with is still intact and relevant it is not in interest to replace with a more powerful and independent politician this case should choose between liberals and hawks between finance and head of largest oil company yet cannot do it right now he has to choose a technocratic and docile figure like who will become a very convenient way to shift responsibility for the economic crisis after 2018 this the ideal candidate to replace is current chief of or his deputy who in the eyes of was responsible for the 1998 economic default is a much more experienced inside the campaign against liberals you mentioned the hawks and liberals within the inner circle who is more influential you can look at this hierarchy both simplistically and from a more sophisticated point of view if we tend to there are the hawks or conservatives and doves or while the former are responsible for politics and foreign the latter deal with the the budget and fiscal policy the other all these law enforcement officials are involved in clan wars to a larger extent than the have nothing to compete for we take into account the debates between the economy finance ministry and the central banks about the nuances of economic closer we look at the political groups within the the more obvious it becomes that all these players are included in in they have less differences than commonalities after all of them support the consensus they support domestic and foreign even though some of them approve it they are just adjusting to the current political situation without openly expressing their sooner or later will have to step down to what extent will the transition of power be difficult in this transition will be very difficult at any rate after there been a rotation of power for years the nuance is can accelerate the transition to democracy only if it brings benefits to him to save his personal security if technocrats and liberals are able to persuade him that his security depends on he might chose this not because he likes democracy today he is not ready for article was initially published direct report political drama heading into 2018

email the releases are not the only revelations and the campaign team are cursing these days official state department documents released pursuant to freedom of information act requests and lawsuits

implications of her relationship with the notorious political operator had a personal financial stake in where he was using his connections to win government contracts for weapons such as osprey global solutions the latest release is sure to reignite the furor that erupted during last years incendiary hearings on secretary role in the deadly 2012 fiasco house committee chairman representative trey then grilled secretary on her relationship and reliance for important decisions while an old friend of the admittedly knew little about and had not ever been to seemingly read every one of his

1549 views 2016 8 comments guest posts by my friend roger is a staunch democrat supporter he is in his seventies and has always voted democrat him and i have had countless discussions over the many years that we have known each other his paternal roots are and he sees himself to be on the left side of but of him and i have not been able to see on the race to the issue he is with the view that has inherited a financial and military disaster and did the best he and that he should not be blamed for his failure to perform as many did after his elaborate and successful yes we can slogan he supported and other domestic reform and this is perhaps where roger and i stop to agree and start to disagree including look at the appalling record of the republican party and try to paint a tainted image of it the party that is affectionately called the grand old party or the by its own staunch supporters certainly has enough such records to put it up there with charges of global mayhem and genocide the has given birth to people like the and of who can forget is another character that comes to one that no thinking man could trust with a a federal senator who commands authority that no one seems to be able to either understand the mandate or challenge at the end of the infamous line republican well at least thus enter trump and what a character he need one say god forbid if this article may be read like a defense of the the is run by the rich and the and as described by w bush by the haves and have more it is the party of dick who saw in an opportunity to generate contracts for if tens of hundreds of thousands of had to die for him to achieve his he would not and did not blink this is the party that condones and feeds it is the party that has huge control over the media it is the party that runs the world like it is a business enterprise and whether the rest of the world likes it or until the current global status quo no political party in the world affects the rest of the world like the ruling party in the united states whilst elections in other countries are domestic affairs that affect domestic politics of the country elections have implications that are not only domestically but have a much further global reach that encompasses every corner of the world as a i am much more concerned about the wider global implications of politics than the domestic ones this is not to say that i am indifferent about and the people as a matter of not only do i have close friends who live in but also close family members and i have grave concerns for all mankind in every corner of the by my interest in politics remains focused on foreign policy and to this i am only able to relate to the choice between the major two parties from the perspective of their foreign policies as insists to be the world police and the a stature many are refusing to accept that they have already it must accept what comes with it and concede that the rest of the world is hoping that the people will choose the better candidate as the new or should i say the one who is less harmful to the world in between and who fits the this is the question enough has been recently said about health to write a horror novel her and alleged recent case of pneumonia have made headlines as if not bigger than her infamous hidden allegations of involvement in the murder of an ambassador and even selling arms to very recently the issue of the emails is resurfacing and very late in the perhaps late enough to serve with a knock out her zeal to reach the seems to have been in her mind even before bills scandal back in 1998 was prepared to publicly support appear to forgive him and move because she had a bigger fish to the she somehow managed to hush down all other sex allegations against all the and trying to score mileage from similar allegations against trump her unabated lust for power will not stop at anything for as long as she ends up at the the first female even if she has to be commander in chief from behind the control button of a wheelchair there are even observations and allegations that many people who have campaigned against her have died under suspicious circumstances whether this mystery is going to be taken up by main stream media just on the eve of the elections to serve her with yet another knock out remains to be seen her uncontrollable laughs and hysterical facial expressions leave many questions unanswered in between the two front runners and it is hard to say that she presents herself as the sane and rational choice is there a distinction on foreign affairs perhaps but not historically for some the republican party is seen as the party of the hawks and the democrats are seen as the doves but are to answer this question in an unbiased we ought to look back at history notwithstanding the history of the the father and the and what is really the history of the democratic a few landmark historical decisions make it very clear so let us start with current events before we dwell into recent history that some might have chosen to forget the war on was the brainless child of the a spring that was heralded by the visit of an president to and a speech he made to clergy at university the presidents name is and he is a democrat speech was a subtle endorsement for the and to be specific to the street to rise the phenomenon and all the events that followed in the escalations and intimidations and the creation of a very volatile situation in a situation that remains hot and of unpredictable have all been orchestrated by the same democrat last but not the current tension in the south china sea is also the outcome of the same the incumbent let us not forget that president is a prize ironically for peace the involvement in the war started under the tenure of the sweetheart like it reached its climax during the administration both and were democrats but all of the above monstrosity is dwarfed by dropping the on and many strategists have argued over the last seven decades as to whether or not president had no other choice to end the war but those arguments do not change the fact that not atom bombs were dropped on cities it is pertinent to note here that the project generated two types of little boy in and fat man in it take a genius to at least suspect that the administration wanted to test the two types and that in their destroying alone was not enough that and even though no were dropped in western and specifically on the brutality that civilians in towns and cities have suffered were simply acts of vengeance and many of them had no military gains to achieve harry was not a republican he was yet another democrat but we forgotten the other democrat sweetheart of the the almost the smiling president jimmy carter many see that carter had an impeccable record of being a humanitarian of the highest degree as a matter of credit must be given to him for his peace and specifically for standing up for the people and for not being silenced by the lobby in it was during the carter administration that was created under the blessing and auspices of the it was a criminal with a twisted mind aka carters national security who actually established the first army in his and he thought that the best way to fight the soviets in was to support and train fighters to rise against the infidel communists and even though the plot eventually generated a monster that turned not only against the hand the fed it but also against the whole to this maintains that he came up with a genius master plan once carter and were both democrats and it is who is beating up the drums of war against and china may have their legitimate preferences that would make them go either for trump or for supporters of each team can and do provide huge lists that make their candidate of choice the better one one of them could well be better for the truth is that as a citizen of the and as mentioned i am more interested in a president who is better for the rest of the world whether trump will trump up the military after an election win is anyones guess but is beating the drums of war already to this and as we stand on the international she is the not trump who are disenchanted by wars must realize that this time the choice to vote democrat is an endorsement of her war aspirations with two minds as to which way to go on the 8 th of this month ought to remember that whatever their local domestic issues the will not win a nuclear war against either or let alone both combined those swinging voters who easily vote for either major party depending on an array of should hopefully discern that this time that a vote for is a vote for war if some have never voted for the in the and more so are physically unable to vote for if others are disenchanted by both major parties or actually never voted and if they regard both candidates as equally one would wonder as to what are waiting for to vote outside the two major what caliber of democrat and republican candidates are such reluctant voters waiting for to vote for a third some argue that a vote for the greens is a wasted vote because the greens will never make it into the at least not in the foreseeable but in any vote that does not endorse is not a wasted vote the essential from the trenches of the emerging world

women who claim they are raped or sexually assaulted should be we should support i thought you lying dog said kyle she said the attacks on her reputation and alleged attacks on other women who had relationships with or were assaulted by bill show that is not a supporter of women or victims of sexual violence kyle said bill threatened her over the phone in the early after she alerted him that a reporter had been asking her questions about their relationship when i warned him about this which i had no intention of cooperating his threat to me if you cooperate with the we will destroy said

matronly and believe it was the same girl bill had moved in with i picked billy up at the airport and he had this woman with him this woman was she said i thought was a impersonator because she looked so bad and she smelled so bad i just believe this was i thought this was some kind of a joke billy was playing on me glared at her from behind lenses with an air of real hostility her thick eyebrows melded together stretching across her forehead finally the this is dolly i was kyle thinking it was some kind of a sick joke a woman in a hideous disguise kyle extended her hand but only glared and

kyle she shredded them she shredded those documents these were notes to him from these were things from kyle said also started calling in the middle of the threatening her she speculated that part of the reason was so enraged was that bills affair with undermined the public story about the early romance they had this story about their romance at law school billy even repeated it at the democratic national convention well what if people knew about dolly kyle and flowers and it kind of ruins said kyle according to bill often used a derogatory nickname for when he was talking to his mistress or the security guards at the governors mansion after the day billy introduced me to he never used her name again he always called her the said kyle she was the person who was trying to keep control of him who was in charge of what he was doing kyle said this nickname fit with reputation in where she was often portrayed as a coarse northerner who disdained the traditional role of an first lady according to there were constant stories about alleged temper on the night bill lost his congressional race in was allegedly overheard lashing out at a campaign staffer with an slur apparently that night when billy was she went on one of her tirades to a guy named said kyle people in the other room heard her call him an bastard in another incident from bill term as was tasked with hosting an annual easter egg hunt at the governors mansion for special needs children according to allegedly became irritated by the slow pace of the event bill and at in 1973 some of were physically impaired some of them were mentally impaired but governors hid the eggs in plain sight and made it easier for these kids to find these said whose close friend was involved in organizing the event so during this hunt it was getting warm in was getting tired of and the kids were moving so she goes stomping onto the veranda she said when are they gonna get those retards out of said kyle and the children were oblivious to it their parents were appalled who says she suffered from sex addiction for many years after she was raped as a recalled one candid conversation she had with bill after she entered therapy she said told her he was also a sex addict i talked to billy about and i went through the 25 questions we use to ask am i a sex its a like said kyle billy and i went through the and he oh my god a sex addict i know if had the cognitive awareness that he was a sex addict this is a problem that can be dealt kyle added at some point in the i felt a hand on my arm and it was billy he says how are despicable how are and i just turned and i just said you are such an anatomical i cant believe bother to said kyle she said after a heated exchange during which a secret service agent tried to separate them she finally agreed to sit down and talk to bill in a quiet corner of the event she told that she had no plans to talk to the but was going to put out a novel that alluded to their affair she also told about a legal aid she had started in the president told her to come to and allegedly promised to turn the organization into a project of the department of housing and urban development kyle said she declined the offer later denied having a sexual relationship with kyle during a deposition for the sexual assault case kyle said she was shocked to hear calling it lie after lie she said just a short while before bills his attorneys had tried to prevent her from testifying in the case by arguing that the two of them had a consensual sexual relationship and her testimony would not be relevant what he did was said who ended up testifying during the case about alleged sex addiction although kyle said she was appalled to hear the sexual assault allegations against she said she absolutely believed them even though was never violent to her during their relationship knowing he was a sex it was easy for me to believe that easy for me intellectually to believe it very difficult she said and thats when i started the billy i knew was not this monster he became kyle claimed she sees a double standard in how the media covers sexual assault allegations against trump and bill not saying leer at some girl not saying he pat one on the fanny i know i know what all of those charges said kyle but the media is focusing on that every single day while billy raped a and sexually assaulted god knows how many women she said that since publishing her book earlier this she has been contacted by multiple women who have also had sexual with but do not want to go public when i please come out and talk about she said because they know that the mainstream media if they get on this is just going to trash them some of them i was 17 at the i was 18 or 19 years i told my husband about my children would be my grandchildren would be embarrassed so they say anything

commentators force to do commentary for hockey and matches it is common to find people in and the surrounding region flaunting their power and influence one has often heard the phrase flaunted by these folks this craving for recognition through power has prompted several impressionable kids in the region to take up aggressive sports to flaunt their power just look at the number of medalists from the region who have won medals in aggressive shooting and wrestling wrestling wrestling who won the bronze in shooting in was brought up in and but his parents hail from the region which explains it the ripple effect from is so strong that even from neighboring won silver medal for shooting in 2004 poor found it difficult to practice a sport like badminton in and had to shift to to become a champion and win a bronze medal in 2012 our channelize the aggressive and power flaunting energy of the kids early on and we can be assured of a few medals from here in every eastern and southern has produced many medalists like in in in tennis and p v and in badminton along with the likes of who show a promise in a sport where was never in the reckoning our just provide encouragement and things will improve our intellectuals and elites attribute the poor showing of to poverty but then what explains western poor show considering that it has two of the most prosperous and the last medal a person from won at the was in wrestling in 1952 but then is home to cricket legends like and of course the cricket commentary of this explains it but what about we are not mainstream media and we do not claim to have expertise on everything and we admit we do not have the answer but the mainstream media which questioned on everything else has kept quiet about this our we do not have an answer to this but we will not keep quiet like the mainstream media why did not produce a single medal will given that the elites blame the lack of facilities in our country for our poor show in what stops the kids of these elites from excelling at with cheap skilled manpower to they should have done well the elites believe in a sense of entitlement and are not willing to work hard sport is a meritocratic activity and only performance matters that is the reason sport is one stream in which is dynasty except for brave exceptions like who are willing to fight against all odds a friendly media and intellectuals ecosystem can make a failed politician look a failed actor a superstar or a news trader a journalist but this ecosystem cannot make a cricket duck look like a cricket century this explains why the son of one of greatest khan who captained cricket team despite having vision in only one chose his mothers profession rather than his fathers his biggest sporting achievement to date remains winning a 100 meters sprint in an macho ad you also know why the daughter of chose acting or why the son of chose journalism of there are exceptions like who went on to become a tennis star despite his father being a member of hockey team and mother being member of basketball team he is also wise in that he choose tennis over hockey or basketball given his ability to get in trouble with his doubles may it be or one wonders how he would have fared in basketball or hockey which has a team of more than 2 players our lack of facilities is not an at least for the elites every other boy wants to become a cricketer for those boys who look beyond analysis of winners show that men have only won in hockey and aggressive sports like boxing and except for in 1900 who was anyway born to parents and moved to soon after winning the medals of course is an exception but we already told you why he did not play hockey and also how aggressive he is even towards his partners our do not expect anything from men beyond hockey and aggressive sports compared to women have won medals in a variety of sports and have been very such as in and p v in in boxing and in wrestling the fact that women got opportunity to train and win in sports like boxing and wrestling that are considered the domain of men show how fake the propaganda of the feminist intellectuals is these feminists intellectuals will form stereotypes based on their opinions and peddle it as facts being into responsible we cannot do that so we decided to explore an angle we thought was a cause for concern while its true that this decade has seen the rise of likes of p v and what concerned us why is there no one to carry forward the legacy of p t and why is falling backwards in womens we did some investigative journalism and the results will shock you the reason is not patriarchy but colonial hangover all of women medal winners have won in indoor sports like badminton and weightlifting as per our small school girls are interested in participating in difficult indoor games like gymnastics but they are scared to play any outdoor games for fear that it will darken their skin is falling behind in womens athletics our ban fair skin creams this single action will ensure wins more medals change the slogan to
