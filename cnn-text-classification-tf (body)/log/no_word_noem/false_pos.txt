recipient email donald trump grabbed a new lifeline speaking at a rally in charlotte , north carolina , on october 15th , he raised a hand as if to take an oath and declared i am a victim ! the great business tycoon , the one and only man who could fix america and make the place great again \( trust me , folks \) , was laying claim to martyrdom and spinning another news cycle i am a victim , he declared , of one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country they are coming after me to try and destroy what is considered by even them the greatest movement in the history of our country i am a victim that pathetic line echoed in my head , which is why im writing this in my long life , i had seen a large white man stand up in a public arena and proclaim those words the shrill , self pitying complaint of the remorseless perpetrator only once before that was in a courtroom in lower manhattan in 1988 the man was joel steinberg , a new york lawyer who , over a 12 year period , had brainwashed and beaten into oblivion a woman named hedda nussbaum , once a successful young editor of childrens books in the early years of their relationship , she had run away several times , seeking help , and every time a doctor or friend had called steinberg to come and get her at that point time and again steinberg would administer punishment , breaking her bones and her spirit she took on what police would later describe as a zombie like quality two lessons lurk in this story , one old and one very up to date first , its a reminder of how much women at that time , even after a great wave of feminism , still blamed women \( including themselves \) for whatever happened to them at the hands of men second , a man with a character like steinbergs is not the kind of guy you want to choose for high office or any office at all joel steinberg stalked a far tinier stage than donald trump and he did more deadly damage , but the two men seem to be brothers under the skin , sharing common character defects well described in psychiatric texts extreme narcissism , a taste for sexual predation , and very similar views of the women on whom they prey like steinberg , who was incapable of seeing himself as the judge accurately described him , trump seems blind to the real nature of his own behavior \( his current wife describes him as a boy \) neither man seems capable of taking responsibility for the harm hes done , and when their own actions finally call down retribution , branding them as losers ah , then come the conspiracy theories and the vindictive wail of the victim last june , i published a piece at tomdispatch venturing to explain why candidate donald j trump was getting rock bottom ratings in the polls from women voters nearly 70 of them reportedly couldnt stand the guy i pointed out what seemed to me to be the obvious trumps behavior perfectly fits the profile of an ordinary wife abuser in a sworn deposition introduced in divorce proceedings , his first wife ivana swore under oath that he had torn out her hair and forcibly raped her , raging at her because he didnt like the results of a scalp reducing procedure \( meant to remove a bald patch \) performed on him by a plastic surgeon she had recommended \( before she collected a 14 million divorce settlement , she toned her story down , saying the assault was not criminal \) about one in three american women are survivors of some version of such treatment , euphemistically called domestic abuse thats roughly 65 million women voters who , as i wrote last june , know a tyrant when they see one i raise this subject again because the now infamous tape of trumps open mic hollywood access bus ride in 2005 added a new page to the rap sheet of this particular abuser in that piece of mine , i traced the history of the principal tactics of coercion used by controlling men like trump some of those tactics , including steinbergs favorites , involve physical force , but most , when used by a skilled abuser , require no force at all trump applies the handiest tools to his targeted victims regularly , leaving no physical marks behind threats , intimidation , degradation , put downs , humiliation , insults , trivial demands , occasional indulgences \( a flash of charm , for example , or a bit of feigned reasonableness \) the lesson is simple and clear the mind can be bent and the spirit shattered without battering the body i neglected , however , to mention one of the most insidious tactics of such abusers , perhaps because its so obvious that it regularly hides in plain sight in the military , its called pulling rank high status is itself a powerful coercive force that can stifle resistance in a lower status victim and so silence him or her status is trumps brandished weapon , his open carry on this , he couldnt have been clearer in boasting of his pussy grabbing skills on that hollywood access tape when youre a star they let you do it you can do anything the most chilling moments on that tape , however , occur after trump emerges from the bus in all his orange splendor , followed by his escort billy bush now a former nbc personality who could be heard on that tape laughing as trump recounted his compulsive assaults bush then greeted his television colleague arianne zucker , who like so many women on american tv was less fully clothed than the men around her , and whom trump had been ogling from the bus while sucking tic tacs to freshen his potty mouth for a possible kissing attack billy bush asked ms zucker , how about a little hug for the donald \? in that short bus trip across the parking lot , bush had learned just what to do to get in good stead with his high status guest , and so , without missing a beat , he threw his lower status co worker to his peppermint salivating pal he then collected a hug from her , too , as trump is heard exonerating himself with the bizarre remark , melania said this was okay it hardly seemed to matter what arianne zucker wanted or believed to be okay billy bushs question wasnt actually a question , but a notice of what was expected clearly , she wanted to keep her job and , just as clearly , hugging predatory , high status stars and coworkers had never been part of her job description , but was a little instant add on of coercion from her colleague setting the star power aside , all of this amounts to commonplace harassment in what appears to be a hostile workplace , and it just happens to be against the law one in three women between the ages of 18 and 24 say that they have been harassed at work yet 70 of all workers \( woman and men \) harassed on the job do not report the offense , often for fear of disbelief or reprisal think of all the women in television who were subjected to harassment and worse by roger ailes the charges now reach back 50 years fired at last by fox news , only to become official media adviser to whom else but presidential candidate donald trump some in the media glossed over trumps bragging as just so much lewd conversation or as trump himself put it locker room talk while his wife melania dismissed it as boy talk in fact , trumps unwanted kissing and groping his self described m o substantiated by one victim after another can be classified in his home state \( under new york penal law , article 130 , section 130 52 forcible touching \) as a class a misdemeanor that may not sound serious , but its punishable by a maximum fine of 1 , 000 \( chump change for the donald \) and a more sobering potential year behind bars it was that tape , all over the media on october 7th , that prompted anderson cooper during the second presidential debate to ask trump three times if he had actually done the sort of things he described to billy bush , which cooper correctly named sexual assault trump finally answered and i will tell you , no i have not and women who had lived for five , 10 , 20 , even 30 years with nagging memories of a trump assault and humiliation had to restrain an immediate impulse to smash the tv set and instead called a news outlet or a lawyer as of this writing , more than a dozen women have gone public with reports of trumps sexual attacks since the release of that hollywood access tape they join a list of women and girls who had previously reported offenses ranging from outright sexual assault to crashing dressing rooms at beauty contests where nude and semi nude women and girls were preparing to compete for the titles of miss universe or miss teen america that brings the number of trumps accusers , as i write , to at least 24 journalists and lawyers have generally managed to verify their accounts of course , trump has repeatedly denied the womens allegations , saying before , during , and ever since the third presidential debate that he had never seen those women before , had no idea who they were , found them insufficiently attractive to warrant his attention , and that their stories had , in any case , been debunked none of his claims were true \( and , for good measure , he announced during his version of a gettysburg address that he would sue every one of them after the election was over \) in my june post , i wrote trumps behavior perfectly fits the profile of an ordinary wife abuser but with one additional twist trump has not confined his controlling tactics to his own home \( s \) for seven years , he practiced such tactics openly for all the world to see on the apprentice , his very own reality show , and now applies them on a national stage , commanding constant attention while alternately insulting , cajoling , demeaning , embracing , patronizing , and verbally beating up anyone who stands in the way of his coronation in this fashion , he humiliated his male republican primary opponents , demeaning them with nicknames little marco , lyin ted , low energy jeb and denigrated his only female primary opponent , carly fiorina , by unfavorably appraising her appearance \( look at that face ! would anyone vote for that \? \) more recently , of course , hes disparaged crooked hillary in a similar fashion \( such a nasty woman ! \) growing up in america hillary clinton , as trump himself has acknowledged , is a fighter who will not quit unperturbed even by his stalking her on stage throughout the second presidential debate and body shaming her afterwards she walked in front of me , he said of a moment in that debate when she crossed the stage to speak to a questioner in the audience believe me , i wasnt impressed in the third debate , she called him out directly on his behavior donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger , she said he goes after their dignity , their self worth , and i dont think there is a woman anywhere who doesnt know what that feels like here was something new under the sun a woman on a presidential debate stage calling out an insufferable man a serial predator , at that on behavior so common among men for so long that the vast majority of women in this country have experienced it and learned to call it life some women still see it that way the new york times , for instance , interviewed a 62 year old woman voting for trump who said that other women offended by his banter should grow up i like to think that hers is a good description of whats happening nationally at the moment , though obviously not in the fashion that she imagined after all , grown up women led the way , among congressional representatives , in calling trump out republican congresswomen barbara comstock of virginia and martha roby of alabama both asked him to withdraw from the race kay granger of texas , mia love of utah , and ann wagner of missouri said they could not vote for him republican senators lisa murkowski of alaska , susan collins of maine , deb fischer of nebraska , and shelley moore capito of west virginia withdrew their support susana martinez , republican governor of new mexico , said she would not support trump , while former republican presidential candidate fiorina said that trump should step aside republican former secretary of state condoleeza rice wrote on her facebook page enough ! donald trump should not be president he should withdraw still , dont expect a serial abuser to be a quitter either faced with accusations of abhorrent and criminal acts he cant acknowledge , plus impending incomprehensible defeat at the polls , and the very real possibility of becoming one of those people he so despises a loser trump casts about for others to blame given his character , its not surprising that he follows , as if by instinct , what we might call the joel steinberg path to self exoneration painting himself , and himself alone , as the ultimate innocent victim of abusive others in a world whose every aspect is rigged against him in his own telling , he , not the women hes demeaned or assaulted , is the abused one and hes taking it for us , for america its quite a self portrait when you think about it and should make us appreciate all the more those women who stepped before the cameras , reported his sexual assaults , and left themselves open to further abuse from trump and his supporters they have done something rare and brave its one thing for a woman to say publicly that she has been sexually assaulted or battered or raped feminist speak outs taught us decades ago to support our sisters by sharing our experience in this way but its another thing to name the perpetrator and call him to account thats what these women have done and wonder of wonders , most women and a whole lot of men believe them , and more than 60 , in the tepid language of the pollsters , have some concerns about the issue count that as a positive change of recent years a light in dismal times on the dark side , you never know what a sore loser and his loyal , bullying , misogynist followers might do say , for example , followers of the type who show up outside hillary rallies with banners reading trump that bitch ! the moment the trial of joel steinberg ended , armed guards surrounded him and hustled him off to prison unfortunately , when this election is over , whether trump wins or loses , hes not likely to go away , a tomdispatch regular , is the author of several books on violence against women , including the feminist classic women who kill and next time , shell be dead battering and how to stop it , which gloria steinem calls the one book you should read on the subject it includes a chapter on the steinberg case she is also the author of the dispatch books original , they were soldiers how the wounded return from americas wars the untold story \( reprinted from tomdispatch by permission of author or representative \)
print fairfax county , virginia , voter jena jones told wnd and radio america she found this democrat insert included with her absentee ballot , among others democratic party officials in fairfax county , virginia , are categorically denying that pro democrat campaign materials were included in the same envelope as a voters absentee ballot , arguing that pamphlets were sent in a separate mailing to absentee voters from the fairfax county democratic committee , or fcdc earlier this week , jena and david jones shared their story of finding more than they expected in the envelope that contained her ballot \( see images of the materials jena and david say they found at the end of this article also included are two images from democrats showing what they say is confusion on the part of the voters \) i found a letter from the governor of virginia asking me to please vote democrat and help keep virginia blue this year , jena explained then i got a letter from the fairfax county democratic committee , giving me a step by step , yes and no what i should vote for as far as the meal tax and all those other things on the ballot in recent days , at least two more people contend they received the same materials in the envelope with their absentee ballots after the report was first published , and shared on facebook by david jones , fairfax county democratic committee executive director frank anderson replied to davids post to dispute their account of what the ballot envelope contained these materials were not sent in the same envelope as the ballot the ballot is mailed separately by the office of elections political parties are free to mail items to voters who request absentee ballots the two envelopes arrived at the same time , commented anderson that triggered a quick back and forth between david jones and anderson i hate to tell you but youre wrong all items came in one envelope , jones said impossible that letter came out of my office we never have access to other peoples ballots , replied anderson then it seems those that sent the ballots have access to your letters , said jones who should i believe \? you or my lying eyes \? anderson then stated that political parties are informed when anyone requests an absentee ballot , and mailings are sent to those voters to promote democratic party candidates and positions on ballot initiatives i am literally sitting down the hall from the place where those envelopes are stuffed we are a political office and have no business handling anyones ballots you can believe what you want to believe , concluded anderson the virginia department of elections did not respond to repeated attempts for a response but after seeing reports from wnd and radio america , anderson protested the premise of the story please stop spreading these absurd allegations that are just hearsay from a misinformed voter who cannot verify his claim , stated anderson in an email in which he also explained why he believed the jones account could not be accurate he shared a photo sent by state sen scott surovell , showing his absentee ballot envelope next to a separate envelope containing democratic party advocacy in a formal interview , fcdc communications adviser bruce neilson told wnd and radio america the jones version of what the ballot envelope contained cannot be true its not possible , said neilson , who then explained how absentee voters are approached by the local democrats voting is a sacred privilege and a right of every citizen , he said the activity of voting is also a public record the fairfax county democratic committee receives a notice of everyone who has requested an absentee ballot we get that information as public information on the day the ballot is mailed the same day the ballot is mailed , our volunteers prepare materials to advise voters what the fairfax \( county \) democratic committee knows to be democratic positions on the ballot , said neilson , noting the materials include fliers on candidates and ballot proposals like the meals tax listen to the wnd radio america interview with bruce neilson however , he insists those materials are never sent with the ballot itself that material is mailed in a separate envelope , labeled with our initials fcdc and our return address in fairfax , virginia , and would be received either the same day , perhaps the day before or the day after she received her official absentee ballot from the government , neilson said its a separate mailing its a separate stamp its a separate envelope its very easy to confuse where they came from if you have all those materials on the table at the same time while youre filling in your votes , he said jones is standing by her story 100 percent , as is her husband david says its a very clear memory jena opened the envelope that contained her ballot , the green sample ballot , the two sided letter from the governor and card with kids on it saying go vote or something of that nature there was also the return envelope , which i signed , david said the coverage of jenas story has also elicited similar stories from two other fairfax county voters both of them commented on reddit i can confirm this i live in herndon , va \( fairfax county \) and also received these materials in my absentee ballot i thought it was fishy at the time but didnt look into it , stated a comment by a reader using the handle thisisaterriblename get the hottest , most important news stories on the internet delivered free to your inbox as soon as they break ! take just 30 seconds and sign up for wnds email news alerts ! another , under the reddit handle nightingale nights , said the same thing happened to them and posted similar photos to the ones david and jena shared last week neilson said there is no way the county government , which sends out the ballots , could be including partisan materials in the envelope containing the ballot they dont have our materials , he said our materials are printed for us , by our printer , and we have complete control over our materials in our office , and they come from our office in our mailing they dont go anywhere else its not possible that the county government is distributing partisan democratic materials its never happened before im not aware of it happening now and i dont think that it would happen anywhere in the future , neilson said there are only a few known complaints of stuffed ballot envelopes in fairfax county , leading david jones to believe an individual in the government is responsible he accepts the explanation that the fairfax county democratic committee is not responsible for what he and jena discovered with her ballot i understand franks comments about his office has nothing to do with the ballots i believe that , jones said i think what we are seeing here is a person that actually stuffs and mails the ballots is taking it upon themselves to add in extra material i dont see how franks office could be held accountable for whats in the ballot envelope but it does seem odd that others are now reporting similar issues neilson said there is zero chance of that scenario being true i just cant imagine that happening because of the internal controls that we have on the literature that we mail , neilson said he also said the internal controls at the county government are air tight i am an election official on election day , i serve in a non partisan capacity for our county election office , nielson said i can assure you , you have democrats and republicans working in the office you have plenty of oversight of the voting process , and theres no way that a partisan political piece was mailed with her ballot there is no way that happened the following are three images of the democratic party materials jena and david jones say they found stuffed inside the absentee ballot the following are two images from democrats who say the voters must be confused
