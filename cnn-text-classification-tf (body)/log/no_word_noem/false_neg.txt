voice plans now allow for unlimited talk , but my brief answer has never changed hes the best person i have ever met closing out her address in raleigh , north carolina , democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton said that the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the hatred and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in history i believe americas best days are still ahead of us if we do what were supposed to do , clinton concluded every social movement , every economic advance , has only come about because people going to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the affect of adversity it wasnt easy to get the vote for women it wasnt easy to have the final efforts made to ensure that the civil rights act was enforced it wasnt easy , because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down , clinton continued it is now our turn , our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back ! we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise , clinton urged the crowd you can make the difference not only in who you elect , but in the agenda that those people then get to work i want you to hold me accountable i want you to be my partners everything ive done started by listening to people listening to hear your stories

protecting the hard fought civil rights that his supporters value we can disagree on many issues but we have come too far , too many people have gone to jail , too many people have died in the struggle for civil rights we are not going back to a bigoted society and furthermore , sanders continued what we understand is our strength , our uniqueness , is our diversity we should be proud of it ! we are not going to allow trump or anyone to divide us up ! vermont senator bernie sanders lauded hillary clintons stance on the environment , and drew contrasts with , well , differences with donald trumps platform there is one difference that is very , very profound , sanders said secretary clinton believes in science and i know , i know i put her in a difficult position in 2016 , to believe in science is a little bit dangerous , but what the heck the debate is over climate change is real , climate change is caused by human activity , and climate change is already , today , causing devastating problems in this country and around the world trump , meanwhile , has concluded that climate change is a hoax emanating from china now , why he chose china and not mexico or some muslim country , i dont know , but thats the way it is this is not a funny issue ive got seven grandchildren , sanders continued our job as custodians of this planet is to make sure that we leave our children and grandchildren a planet that is healthy and habitable and that means that we have to have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry and tell them that their short term profits are not more important than the future of our planet donald trump attempts to praise veterans im brave in other ways im financially brave big deal vermont senator bernie sanders , campaigning for hillary clinton in raleigh , north carolina , hit hard on the subject of paid family leave , one of clintons most committed policy planks that is why secretary clinton and i will fight o guarantee 12 weeks

should have a vote on brexit put the cat among the pigeons , sending the pound soaring and the uk market lower news that the bank of england had kept interest rates on hold helped sterling keep much of its gains , and kept the pressure on shares the ftse 100 is dominated by exporters and overseas earners who have benefitted from a weak pound , so the reverse is also true the more domestically focused ftse 250 managed to gain ground despite the uncertainty european markets outperformed the uk , helped by positive updates from ing , socgen and credit suisse the us was struggling for direction as investors fretted about the outcome of next weeks presidential election there was also one eye on fridays non farm payroll numbers the closing scores in europe showed the ftse 100

ruling on brexit and the bank of england keeping interest rates on hold may not be the end of it , says kathleen brooks , research director at city index sterling is currently up 1 25 against the dollar at 1 2450 , and incidently , is also stronger against the euro , up 1 24 at 1 1224 brooks said although global markets remain at the mercy of the outcome of the us election , if hillary clinton does manage to win next week , then the pound may continue to outperform the g10 the court ruling on article 50 opens the door to a delayed brexit , which seems a good enough excuse for the foreign exchange market to extend this pound rally further the increase in the bank of englands inflation forecast could also keep upward pressure on uk gilt yields , which are the building blocks of a stronger pound , in our view overall , us election fears weighing on the dollar , and brexit fears temporarily receding , could trigger a break above 1 25 in the pound dollar in the near term if this happens then we could see the pound dollar move towards the 1 25 1 30 range between now and the fed meeting in december back with the bank of england and its forecast changes , unicredit research is now expecting uk interest rates to remain on hold next year daniel vernazza , its lead uk economist , said the tone of the inflation report , mpc minutes and the governors press conference were notably less dovish than we had expected in particular , the mpc said monetary policy could now move in either direction to changes to the economic outlook , cancelling its guidance from august that a cut was the most likely next move as a result , we have now cancelled our expectation for a cut in the bank rate in february next year we now expect the mpc to remain on hold throughout 2017 so , whats changed in the last three months \? first , economic activity has been much stronger than the boe had expected second , the further depreciation of sterling since the beginning of october will push up inflation meaningfully over the forecast period gregory daco \( gregdaco \) ism non manufacturing pmi falls to 54 8 in oct business activity , new orders , employment all cool but overall points to 2 gdp growth pic twitter com 4c2uuxgnopnovember 3 , 2016 skipping across the atlantic for a moment , and news of a slowdown in us service sector growth , partly due to caution about next weeks election the ism non manufacturing index fell from 57 1 in september to 54 8 last month , below expectations of a level of 56 anthony nieves , chair of the ism non manufacturing survey committee , said there has been a slight cooling off in the non manufacturing sector month over month , indicating that last months increases werent sustainable respondents comments remain mostly positive about business conditions and the overall economy several comments were made about the uncertainty on the impact of the upcoming u s presidential election meanwhile orders for manufactured goods rose by 0 3 in september , up from 0 4 the previous month , the third straight month of increases following the figures the dow jones industrial average is up 37 points or 0 2 the dollar is still down against the pound , with sterling at 1 2453 , up 1 26 following the high court brexit decision and the bank of england deciding not to cut interest rates again howard archer , economist at ihs markit , is now forecasting uk interest rates to stay at 0 25 for some time he also expects growth to be slower than the bank is predicting but inflation to be higher we are dropping our expectation that interest rates will be taken down to a low of 0 10 we now believe that it is more likely than not interest rates will stay at 0 25 for a prolonged period \( very possibly to 2020 \) ahead of the november mpc meeting and quarterly inflation report , we had considered it most likely that interest rates would be taken down to 0 10 but not until the second quarter of 2017 when we expected economic activity to be increasingly pressurised by brexit uncertainty \( following the anticipated triggering of article 50 \) and diminishing fundamentals for consumers we are actually more pessimistic than the bank of england on growth but see inflation higher specifically , we forecast gdp growth to slow from 2 1 in 2016 to 1 1 in 2017 , then improve only gradually to 1 3 in 2018 and 1 5 in 2019 we see consumer price inflation moving above3 in late 2017 and peaking around 3 5 around spring 2018 it is also notable that mr carney observed that the uk has an outstanding framework for monetary policy , which works well and does not need to be adjusted this follows recent comments by politicians that could be construed to threaten the bank of englands independence as well as some attacks on mr carney and the mpc particularly on their stance on the risks from brexit the tuc is also worried that households face a severe wage squeeze next year , as the weaker pound drives up inflation tuc general secretary frances ogrady fears britain cant afford a second dose of falling real wages \( as seems possible , if companies dont provide inflation busting pay rises \) ogrady says the banks warning must spur the government into action so that workers dont pay the price of brexit with a squeeze on wages uk workers already suffered the largest fall in real wages after the financial crisis of any developed country except greece they cant afford another hit to their pay packets the chancellor should use the autumn statement to protect jobs and wages , with new investment in infrastructure like roads , rail , green energy and homes and the national minimum wage must be increased to keep it well ahead of inflation and heres a reminder of the boes new fan chart , showing how it expects inflation to romp upwards in 2017 and 2018 photograph bank of england ian kernohan , economist at royal london asset management , agrees with mark carney that households are going to find life tougher next year , as brexit uncertainty continues to swirl he says gdp growth is likely to slow next year , on the back of a squeeze in real household incomes and ongoing brexit uncertainty photograph rlam if youre just tuning in , heres katie allens news story about how uk interest rates were left on hold today bank of england signals further rate cuts unlikely and lifts 2017 growth forecast read more photograph kirsty wigglesworth paas suspected , mark carney faced some robust questioning at todays quarterly inflation report the governor found himself having to defend the banks forecasting powers , after it almost doubled its forecast for 2017 growth \( to 1 4 \) , just three months after slashing it drastically he also repeatedly fended off questions about his own future , and whether he could possibly be lured to stay beyond june 2019 personally i cant believe hed reject the chance for more meetings with the uk economics press pack but what did we learn \? 1 \) life is going to get tougher , especially for poorer families carney warned that inflation will take a real bite out of earnings , saying we see very modest real income growth over the course of next year and into 2018 thats because the cpi rate is expected to surge to 2 7 in 2017 , and hit 2 8 in 2018 which is higher than wage growth today and he said the bank is facing a balancing act between allowing inflation to rise over target \( driving down real wages \) and higher unemployment \( which would happen if the bank tightened monetary policy \) 2 \) the economy is doing better than the bank expected alongside death and taxes , you can be pretty certain that the bank of englands economic forecasts will be tweaked before long but still , todays upward revisions to growth in 2016 and 2017 are quite significant and show that the boe was too gloomy about the immediate impact of voting to leave the eu carney painted a picture of serene calm the mpc had expected consumption to continue to grow solidly throughout the remainder of 2016 but consumption has been even stronger , with households appearing to entirely look through brexit related uncertainties for households , the signs of an economic slowdown are notable by their absence perceptions of job security remain strong wages are growing at around the same modest pace as at the start of the year credit is available and competitive confidence is solid indeed , he had to pour cold water on the suggestion that consumers are being stupid by still hitting the high street 3 \) but there are signs that things are getting worsethe bank still sees signs that firms are cutting back , as they watch brexit play out that uncertainty does bear down on business investment , that effect builds with time , that lower business investment has consequences for employment 4 \) we should get used to brexit uncertaintythe governor said that todays court ruling that mps must vote on article 50 is simply an example of the drama we should get used to , as britain leaves the eu obviously i am not qualified to comment on the court judgment or the prospects here , but it is an example of the uncertainty that will characterise this process the negotiations havent even yet begun , there will be uncertainty , there will be volatility around those negotiations as they proceed , and i would view this as one example of that uncertainty 5 \) the next interest rate move could be up britains primary schools are full of children who werent even born when the bank last raised interest rates \( it was july 2007 , just before the credit crunch \) and a few months ago , many city economists were convinced rates would fall to 0 1 soon not any more , with the boe dropping its guidance that the next move is probably down as carney puts it you can envisage scenarios where it goes either way we dont have a bias in terms of direction of where the next move will be again , in a period of a fair bit of uncertainty you can envisage scenarios where either direction would be merited make of that what you will katie allen \( katieallengdn \) carney asked if next rate move more likely up or down you can envision scenarios where either direction is merited could go either way november 3 , 2016sathnam sanghera \( sathnam \) this is basically me deciding between nandos and wagamama https t co ls8wcf6ofcnovember 3 , 20166 \) the bank of england isnt at war with downing street asked about theresa mays criticism of monetary policy , he argued we dont feel under any pressure from the government , certainly none from the prime minister i think the prime minister fully supports , and the government fully supports , the monetary policy framework we have in place and in that framework we take those decisions and he also indicated he accepted criticism from mps , as part of the banks accountability he wouldnt say whether some critics should take a vow of silence , alas carney wont be lured into setting a figure perhaps burned by his previous experience of forward guidance it all depends what is causing prices to rise over target , and what the best response is katie allen \( katieallengdn \) carney wo n't give a numerical limit we will tolerate on inflation any limit is a product of what 's causing inflation overshoot november 3 , 2016howard archer \( howardarcheruk \) carney refuses to give a figure which is a beyond tolerable level of inflation says it depends on what reasons behind the overshoot arenovember 3 , 2016 not at all people still have jobs , and are behaving rationally , mark carney replies ed conway \( edconwaysky \) carney we dont feel under any political pressure from the govt pm govt fully support monetary policy framework we have in place november 3 , 2016 carney is then asked whether theresa mays recent criticism of the banks monetary policy , at the tory party conference , has undermined him not at all , he replies we dont feel under any pressure from the government , and especially not from the prime minister the prime minister , and the government , fully support the monetary policy framework we have in place hugo duncan of the daily mail tries to get some new forward guidance out of the governor you can see scenarios where it goes either way , we dont have a bias , mark carney replies but the monetary policy committee currently unanimously believes that the present stance is right
here are the guardians main stories on todays article 50 court rulingtheresa mays plan to trigger brexit by the end of march will not be derailed by a high court ruling that parliament must vote on the decision , no 10 has insisted official reaction on the continent to the high courts ruling on article 50 has been muted , with national governments and the european commission regarding the decision as an internal matter parliament alone has the power to trigger brexit by notifying brussels of the uks intention to leave the european union , the high court has ruled the pound jumped on the news that negotiations over britains withdrawal from the european union could be delayed , after the high court rejected government claims that it has the sole power to trigger article 50 this is the most important development in the brexit story since the election of theresa may as prime minister and easily the most encouraging day for those who backed remain since the referendum on june 23 ive posted vast amounts of commentary on this already , but here is what it means in six key points 1 the court ruling is much more definitive than anyone expected \( see , for example , david allen green at 4 10pm \) the government is appealing to the supreme court , but informed commentators seem to think it more likely than not that the government will lose again 2 unless the government does win at the supreme court , parliament will get to legislate on invoking article 50 and that means a proper bill , passing through the commons and the lords , with mps and peers getting the chance to amend it theresa may has been refusing to give parliament a vote on the terms of brexit because , once power shifts from the hands of the executive to the legislature \( see 8 49am \) , the prime minister loses some control the key point about today is that mps and peers have , for the first time , got a strong chance of shaping the start of the brexit process 3 the chances of brexit being overturned are still very minimal it is just about possible to conceive how the uk could stay in the eu \( parliament votes to insert a second referendum clause into the article 50 brexit bill , and some economic catastrophe results in a sharp change in public opinion by 2018 \) but you would be unwise to bet on it most mps and peers who voted remain accept that the result of the referendum should be honoured 4 but the chances of brexit being soft not hard have increased significantly there is a majority for a soft brexit in parliament and , if there is a bill , it will now have the chance to exercise leverage 5 there is now a real possibility that theresa may will not be able to trigger article 50 before the end of march the government says it still intends to meet this deadline , but the need to legislate could lead to a delay 6 an early election , though by no means inevitable , now does look more likely than it did this time yesterday thats all from me for today i had been intending to cover other stories , but im afraid this one took over thanks for the comments the votes of northern ireland mps in the house of commons could prove critical if theresa may and the government is forced to ask parliament to trigger article 50 all eight democratic unionist party mps are guaranteed to back brexit in the commons given that they were the only major political force in the stormont assembly to active back a leave vote in junes referendum however , the position of the two ulster unionist mps fermanagh south tyrones tom elliott and danny kinahan in south antrim is interesting in june uup leader mike nesbitt called for a remain vote the uup has now switched position and said its mps will back the government to allow for the referendum result to be implemented the party will argue this is because the entire electorate of the uk has spoken in the referendum and it is their duty to back up that outcome in the commons the switch though may also be due to fears of being further outflanked by the dup especially given a number of recent defections from the uup to the democratic unionists in essence the uup is again moving to the right in order to slow down its decline vis a vis the dup all three sdlp mps will definitely vote to block brexit given that the party campaigned vigorously for remain and was involved in last weeks failed legal action in the belfast high court to declare brexit null and void in northern ireland only sinn fein will not vote in the commons because it boycotts the parliament although the party will come under fire accused of failing to add to the remain voices in the chamber that could scupper brexit yet it is the votes of the unionist bloc that will prove far more critical if and when the referendum result is tested in the house of commons expect more demands from dup first minister arlene foster for special treatment for northern ireland \( guaranteed post brexit farming subsidies for ulster agriculture for instance \) in order to bolster the governments numbers in a brexit vote even one after a general election here is douglas carswell , the ukip mp , on the court ruling douglas carswell mp \(

abetted by lawyers , seeking to tell electorate to sod offnovember 3 , 2016 a majority of voters now want britain to remain in the european union , according to a poll , the press association report but there was little sign that the ultra slim 51 49 majority in favour of remain reflected a change of heart since the 52 48 referendum vote to leave just 3 of leave voters polled by bmg research said they would now vote remain , while 4 of those who backed eu membership on june 23 said they would switch in the other direction the remain camps advantage came from voters who did not take part in the referendum , 46 of whom said they would now back eu membership , against 27 who would vote to leave bmg found that the conservatives were ranked the best party to handle brexit negotiations with the remaining eu , with the backing of 36 of voters , against 10 for labour , 9 for ukip and 2 each for liberal democrats and greens george osborne , the conservative former chancellor , has joined those saying parliament should now have a proper debate about what brexit will entail he told sky news the question is not who makes the decision on whether were leaving the european union because the public have made that decision in the referendum i think the sooner we get on to the substantive discussion in parliament with the government about the nature of our new relationship with europe , how were going to trade with these key partners of ours like germany and france , how businesses here in manchester and across the country are going to have the certainty so that they can invest and hire people over the next couple of years for me these are the key issues and i would be arguing for the closest possible trading and economic relationship with europe , outside of the eu , because weve got to respect the referendum george osborne photograph jonathan brady pa here is andrew tyrie , the conservative chair of the commons treasury committee \( and a remain voter in june \) , on the court ruling whatever the supreme court decides , the government should be much more transparent about its objectives in the negotiations , in some detail , and the sooner the better it should also ensure that parliament can scrutinise the objectives , and vote on them there are many good reasons for this among several , it can enable the construction of broad based public consent for the uks future relationship with the eu the uk is leaving a public debate is needed about where we want to arrive before taking off , it is always a good idea for the pilot to discuss with the passengers and crew where they might want to land second , clarity about the governments objectives would enable a serious discussion with other member states to get underway , prior to the triggering of article 50 and third , it can reduce the economic damage caused by uncertainty over the likely shape of the uks future relationship with the eu it is the uncertainty about the terms of that relationship , far more than the additional time required to clarify the negotiating position , that carries the more significant cost andrew tyrie photograph felix clay for the guardian ladbrokes have cut the odds on a general election taking place next year its now at 2 1 the bbcs jeremy vine seems to agree jeremy vine \( thejeremyvine \) surely there will now be a general election in 2017 brexit highcourtnovember 3 , 2016glen ohara , a history professor , is thinking along the same lines glen o'hara \( gsoh31 \) so you 're the pm you can get bogged down in both houses on a50 details , or you can win a landslide in a ge what do you do \? november 3 , 2016 here is an article 50 court ruling reading list david allen green , the lawyer and financial times legal commentator , says the judgment looks almost appeal proof the judgment looks , at early glance , to be almost appeal proof it was made unanimously by three experienced appeal judges , sitting exceptionally at first instance they are the lord chief justice , the master of the rolls and the leading public law judge at the court of appeal it is reasoned and detailed at one point , the court appears to hold that the governments case was too weak to win on its own terms , regardless of the claimants case why did the government lose \? it seems that the crucial issue is the impact on the rights of citizens if the article 50 notification is irrevocable then the argument is that these rights will be removed automatically in due course this cannot be done , other than by an act of parliament the government could have side stepped this difficulty by not accepting that the notification was irrevocable \( and many , including lord kerr who wrote article 50 of the lisbon treaty , say a notification must be revocable \) but it saw this legally sensible move as politically unacceptable looking at the judgment , the impression is that the governments concession on this crucial point determined the outcome of the case jolyon maugham , the barrister and legal writer , says in a financial times article that if the government loses its appeal , theresa may will not be able to trigger article 50 by the end of march as she hopes imagine this it is november 2018 the promised trade deals have failed to appear unemployment and inflation are on the rise the public mood towards brexit has turned ugly , and so have negotiations with our biggest and nearest trading partner in that world , any rational mp would wish that , back in november 2016 , she had left ajar the door to remaining in the eu why make the decision now , with modest evidence , if you have the opportunity to make it later with more \? these points will be debated in the commons and they must also be debated in the lords and , in practical terms , it is difficult to contemplate that these steps drafting a bill , debating it in the commons , voting on amendments , placing it before the house of lords and then addressing amendments introduced by the upper chamber in the commons again can sensibly be taken after the result of the supreme court appeal is known but before march so , whatever else the decision means , unless the supreme court overturns the high courts decision , theresa mays march deadline will be ancient history hannah white at the institute of government has a q a on what the ruling means will mps and lords vote to pass the bill \? this will of course come down to politics both the commons and lords have a majority of members who argued for the uk to remain a member of the eu but politically , they may not wish to vote against the decision of uk voters taken through the referendum , particularly as most constituencies outside the scotland , northern ireland and the major cities voted against remaining in the eu nonetheless , they will wish to ensure that the decision to trigger article 50 receives an appropriate degree of parliamentary scrutiny depending on how the bill is drafted and it is likely to be very short there may be moves to amend it to place conditions on the government before it can trigger article 50 these could take the form of timing or process requirements for example , a requirement on the government to provide parliament with information about its negotiating position before triggering article 50 albert sanchez graells , a law lecturer , says on his eu economic law blog that he thinks the appeal to the supreme court will lead to the european court of justice \( or the court of justice of the european union cjeu \) getting involved now , in case of an appeal of the high courts decision before the uksc , in my opinion , the referral to the cjeu is legally unavoidable \( i will not deal for now with arguments of judicial politics or pragmatic views on the ukscs likely course of action \) even if the parties do not challenge or even raise to the ukscs consideration the matter of the \( ir \) reversibility of and article 50 notification , it is a logical given that the uksc needs to take a stance \( even if implicit \) on this point in order to be able to rule on the case if it quashes the high courts decision , it needs to clarify the points of law which the high court would have gotten wrong one of which concerns the irrevocability of an art 50 notification if it upholds the high courts decision , it is \( implicitly \) accepting the assumption that an art 50 notification is irrevocable either way , the uksc cannot escape a substantial \( implicit \) consideration of the interpretation of article 50 in my view , this engages the ukscs obligation to request a preliminary ruling from the cjeu under article 267 \( 3 \) tfeu and not doing so triggers a risk of infringement of eu law by the uk due to the acts \( or omission , in this case \) of its highest court sam hooper at semi partisan politics says leave campaigners should not worry too much about the judgment i dont really remember the poll tax riots toward the tail end of thatchers government i mean , i remember seeing stories about it on the news , but since i was only eight years old the political ramifications of what i was seeing rather eluded me but despite my hazy memory , i think it is safe to say were mps \( and it would have to include many labour mps representing constituencies which voted to leave the eu \) to vote against giving the government authority to invoke article 50 , the resulting conflagration would make the poll tax riots look like a summer picnic on hampstead heath robert peston , the itv political editor , says on facebook that brexiteers are guilty of hypocrisy it is spectacularly delicious that leading brexiteers are arguing that the high court today got it wrong today in ruling that we cannot leave the eu without the assent of parliament in that almost their entire campaign to get us out of the eu was that british courts and westminster must be sovereign , and no longer subjugated to brussels jo murkens at the lse blog says the ruling was a proper drubbing for the government the high courts decision is exemplary in its clarity and reasoning anyone interested in a tutorial on the uk constitution should read the first 56 paragraphs the legal challenge was not supposed to be a major obstacle for the government all it needed to assert and defend were the uks own constitutional requirements in failing to understand the constitution of its own country , the government was taught an embarrassing lesson by the high court on the strand here is the guardians politics weekly

key points he made grieve said he thought the article 50 ruling could delay slightly the triggering of article 50 if the governments appeal failed , there would have to be primary legislation , he said it could be short , but it would be debatable and amendable he said this would not necessarily take a long time at the end of the day you can get primary legislation through parliament quite quickly it has been known to be done in 48 hours , but thats as an emergency but he said this might delay slightly the triggering of article 50 he said the government was not ready to trigger article 50 now anway it is worth bearing in mind that the government isnt ready to trigger article 50 itself at the moment at all because it doesnt really know at the moment what it is going to do next he said he did not think jeremy wright , his successor as attorney general , would have to resign if the government lost its appeal this is an issue of law , not politics , he said greive said the high court judgement was utterly rational there is a hugely well established principle in this country that laws and statutes conferring rights on people passed by parliament cannot be removed without parliament voting to do it that is what this question is about dominic grieve photograph sky news kay burley \( kayburley \) today 's high court brexit ruling summed up in a paragraph by ft pic twitter com r1zazvi0fvnovember 3 , 2016 david davis , the brexit secretary , has been giving a statement about the article 50 ruling to broadcasters here are the key points davis said that , unless the judgment is overturned on appeal , the government will have to pass an act of parliament to trigger article 50 asked if it would be possible for the government to give mps a say just by having a quick vote on a narrow resolution , he said thats not available there would have to be an act , he said \( in other words , matthew scott is right see 1 24pm \) he said the government was appealing against the court ruling because , although it accepted parliamentary sovereignty , the people were ultimately sovereign and 17 4m people voted for brexit it was the biggest mandate in history , he said and he said that mps had voted six to one in favour of letting the people decide through a referendum david davis photograph sky news here is the official downing street statement on the article 50 ruling a spokesperson said the government is disappointed by the courts judgment the country voted to leave the european union in a referendum approved by act of parliament and the government is determined to respect the result of the referendum we will appeal this judgment mailonline made its views on the three judges responsible for the article 50 ruling quite clear in this headline earlier

pic twitter com jnzdttylr9november 3 , 2016in an article for the new statesman , stephen bush challenges liberal brexiteers to speak out about views like this nicola sturgeon , the scottish first minister , has put out a fresh statement about the article 50 ruling she says the uk government should accept it and shelve its appeal she said the high courts judgment is not a surprise to anyone who has been following this case , and the uk government should now accept this decision rather than take it to the uk supreme court that the uk government is now in the position where the court has ruled against it and is insisting that parliament must vote before article 50 can be triggered underlines the chaos and confusion at the heart of the tories handling of brexit lets be clear the prime minister has not tried to avoid parliament because of constitutional principles but because any vote in parliament would expose the complete lack of a plan for what brexit means in whatever eventually comes forward from the uk government to parliament , snp mps will not vote in any way that would undermine scotlands interests
its almost six months since sadiq khan became london mayor and opinion polls suggest that londoners are pleased with him so far hes had a high public profile , addressing the capitals security concerns , making friends with hillary clinton and even being lauded by the evening standard khan has allied with london business groups and others to lobby national government for infrastructure investment and stronger devolved powers brexit , which he and most london voters opposed , has added edge and urgency to this campaign hes also made starts on tackling londons harmful air quality , sizing up barriers to social inclusion and recalibrating transport for london to meet some of his bolder policy goals but his biggest challenge is what is now routinely called the london housing crisis this is the issue londoners are most concerned about accordingly , khan dubbed the mayoral election a housing policy referendum a large part of his approach to this complex policy area will be trying to increase the delivery of homes that are affordable for people on low and middle incomes khan has so far not set a target for the absolute number of what he calls genuinely affordable homes to be built in his four year term , but he has committed to a long term goal of 50 of all new london dwellings meeting that definition how well is he doing so far \? what progress is he making towards honouring other housing pledges in his manifesto \? a lot of the work on housing has been hard graft behind the scenes there is a widely shared view that khans deputy for housing and residential development , james murray , has applied himself to the vast task with an energy , an intelligence and a political will that was lacking in boris johnsons time as mayor he has been nurturing the broad consensus that unless london makes a better job of building the kinds of homes it and its people most need , everyone stands to lose including the rest of the country the goodwill of housing associations , boroughs of all political complexions , employers and commercial property developers has been sought a dinner murray had with new housing minister gavin barwell , who is also minister for london and mp for a marginal london constituency , appears to have gone swimmingly khan has repeatedly stressed that altering the london housing equation so that it generates better results wont happen quickly or easily sooner or later , though , londoners will want to start seeing solid results what follows is a round up of khans housing policy progress so far and some pointers to important things to come a trade off with property developerslater this year , after the governments autumn public spending statement on 23 november , city hall will issue its long brewing supplementary planning guidance \( spg \) designed to encourage higher affordable housing yields from planning deals struck between boroughs and property developers across the city like it or not , london depends heavily on private sector companies to finance and deliver buildings it needs including much of its affordable housing inviting them to take a hike might get you a round of applause but , the ways things are now , wont help put roofs over peoples heads khans spg will effectively offer developers an incentive to ensure that the proportion of affordable homes agreed for larger schemes meets a minimum level , expected to be 35 london mayors have considerable powers to intervene in planning arrangements being worked out at borough level the spg will show khan willing to give a fair wind to plans enshrining the desired percentage , but take a long , hard look at those that dont the trade off is that developers will benefit from the certainty this approach provides they may have mastered the dark arts of viability , but the attendant aggravation costs them time and money too the spg will also set out what types of home called affordable by national government meet khans more stringent definition of being genuinely so increasing affordable supply with public moneykhan has spent some of whats left of the 1 25bn provided to boris johnson for 2015 2018 to increase the affordable housing component of housing planned for the first section of the vast old oak and park royal regeneration project in west london \( whose overall stewardship under johnson hes described as a mess \) he will soon produce a successor to johnsons funding prospectus , outlining to housing associations and boroughs what it will take for them to secure grants from him this will be published following the autumn statement city hall is lobbying for further funding for affordable homes building affordable homes on public landprior to khans election , transport for london \( tfl \) had named a panel of developer partners to work with on jointly profiting from building on over 300 acres on 75 sites in its large land portfolio its prime objective was to make as much money as it could for the citys transport systems khan , though , wants an overall 50 of homes built on these sites to be genuinely affordable his manifesto specified that these would be part buy , part rent shared ownership dwellings prioritised for first time buyers whove been renting for five years , especially in outer london it is another key strand of his drive to increase affordable housing supply since the election , khan has put in place arrangements for 200 out of 400 homes he wants built on tfl land at kidbrooke station to meet his requirements and urged the transport body to prioritise some of its smaller sites elsewhere an announcement earlier this week concerned two of these one is called landmark court near london bridge station , which has been lined up for more than 100 homes , of which at least 35 will be affordable the other is called fenwick south , which is actually owned by lambeth council the building of 55 social rented homes already planned for it as part of the agreement that will extend the northern line into nine elms will now begin early next year sooner than expected tfl will be responsible for delivering the homes , which will be owned and managed by lambeth a best practice guide for estate regeneration another way khan could increase the supply of affordable homes would be by helping boroughs to add to the number on council owned housing estates recent research has emphasised that many of the biggest inner london estates have already been rebuilt or replaced , but that the potential exists to densify others to the tune of an estimated 4 , 000 to 8 , 000 homes a year the problem is that such regenerations have the potential to be contentious , contested and to go very wrong not least for people living on them one positive route through this difficult terrain is to find ways of densifying without extensive demolition and temporary rehousing , with current residents directly benefiting from the results when he was islington councils housing lead , james murray firmly favoured the latter approach a best practice document , setting out the mayors principles for getting estate regeneration right , is expected to be published by the end of this month introducing the london living rent khans plan to bring in a new private sector tenure with rents set at one third of average local household incomes thereby fitting his definition of genuinely affordable was a major element of his housing manifesto in september , he said london households typically earning between 35 , 000 and 45 , 000 a year which would cover couples each earning substantially less than the average london incomes would qualify for these new homes and be able to rent a two bedroom flat for less than 1 , 000 per month , compared with the london average of 1 , 450 subsequent published details indicate that the eligible household income range could be as wide as 25 , 000 to 60 , 000 , depending on the area of london the mayors intention is that this new form of tenure would enable tenants to save for mortgage deposits and move on to home ownership it best described as rent indexing rather than rent controlled according to one housing expert , though at city hall they prefer to describe it as a form of rent regulation applied to a specific type of affordable home housing providers have said they would be able to supply london living rent properties , though some political debate has centred on how far theyd be affordable to renters earning the london living wage the tenure period under london living rent terms will be generally of up to five years , says city hall hackney council , which is eager to help young , middle income residents remain in the borough as well as sustaining its social housing delivery , has pledged to be the first to see 500 london living rent homes built it is thought that the very first london living rent homes could start to be built next year understanding the impacts of foreign buyersmuch blame for londons high housing costs is routinely aimed at foreign buyers investing in absurdly expensive prime central flats , but the true impacts of such finance and the use to which resulting properties are put are varied and unclear khan is commissioning independent research into the phenomenon , hoping to get a fuller picture so that housing policy can be developed accordingly significantly , the remit for this research recognises that , for good or ill , overseas buyers continue to play a big part in enabling development in london to happen khan wants the final report delivered next spring lessening the ill effects of the housing and planning actduring the mayoral election campaign , khans conservative rival zac goldsmith made much of an amendment to a piece of legislation that even fellow tories thought very bad for london and which goldsmith claimed would enable the forced sale of council homes to result in twice as many affordable homes being built in the capital as would be lost but the true impact of the act in london cannot be fully assessed until its accompanying regulations are published , interpreting the various elements that leave room for discretion the eu referendum and its turbulent aftermath have meant progress on this task has been slow the appointment of gavin barwell as housing minister \( see above \) and his suggestion of a shift away from controversial starter homes , thought largely useless as an affordable product in london , towards supporting a wider range of relatively low cost homes , including for rent , have raised tentative hopes that the worst aspects of the act as they could affect the capital might be reduced protecting the green belthousing supply analysis published during the election campaign underlined how difficult it will be to increase the number of homes built in london to the overall 50 , 000 a year it is generally held to need a figure khan has acknowledged but not committed to without boroughs bringing forward some of their green belt land for building on but the issue is politically explosive and khan has gone to considerable lengths not to ignite it , both during the campaign and since , making much of his rejection of tory bromley councils plans for a football stadium and flats to go on green belt land in chislehurst a not for profit lettings agencyin his manifesto , khan promised to set up a london wide , not for profit lettings agency for good landlords , building on the work that councils have started , and ending rip off fees for renters word is that work has begun on this at city hall , but it is at an early stage stopping affordable rent conversionsa policy introduced by the tory led coalition government encouraged housing associations and councils to convert social rented homes to new , more expensive affordable rent tenures when they became vacant and were re let to new people on waiting lists \( with the strain often taken by housing benefit , the bill for which the government is actually trying to reduce \) this was correctly seen as a threat to social housing numbers at a time when more , not fewer , are needed khan , committed to protecting social housing in london as a vital asset , has moved to block these conversions city hall says that under boris johnsonss 2011 2015 affordable homes programme , a total of 19 , 000 were approved \( see notes to editors here \) with 14 , 000 of those now completed the rate of conversions has slowed recently , but khan says he will work with housing associations through his affordable homes programme to put an end to them homes for londoners teamkhan promised to set up a new and powerful team at the heart of city hall to pull together all the mayors housing powers and resources and break the homebuilding logjam so far , a homes of londoners governance board has been formed , chaired by khan it will meet for the first time next month , after the autumn statement a skills and capacity audit is underway and an in house team of experts on development viability is being assembled with a view to making the provisions of the supplementary planning guidance stick \( read more on that here \) perhaps the homes for londoners title is best understood as a banner flying above various forms of co ordinated action preparing for a new london plan and housing strategymayoral housing policy has to be in line with those enshrined in the london plan , the name given to the mayors statutory spatial development strategy for the capital the current london plan is boris johnsons that doesnt mean khan is totally hamstrung by it , but it does mean he needs to put it through a full review which will result in a new version in up to three years time that review is underway with the launch of a consultation document called a city for all londoners in this , khan sets out the challenges posed by the capitals rapid growth and some of the ways he hopes to meet them , including in housing themes include some of those mentioned above and homelessness , including rough sleeping the mayor will also be producing a specific housing strategy to replace johnsons it will come out some time next year summarythe essential difference between khans approach to housing policy and that of his tory predecessor is that the labour mayor is , as youd expect , taking a more interventionist approach to shaping and regulating the huge , unruly beast that is the london housing market he appears to be demonstrating far greater drive for getting more homes across the genuinely affordable spectrum built his mayoral team and city hall officers are of a high calibre and have demonstrated the pragmatic , consensus building approach that is fundamental to mayors getting things done londons housing problems might be characterised as a combination of its booming successes over more than two decades and a consequence of successive national governments inadequate responses to the failure of the market to respond in the right way to its demands housing shortages and other problems arent new to london , and the current ones are beyond the power of any mayor to completely solve alone but the hope is that khan can provide strong

middletown timelineweve been asking readers to help guide and shape gary younges reporting from muncie , indiana , where , for the past month , hes been taking the political pulse of middle america during this volatile election here , residents tell us about the issues that matter most to them when it comes to voting , and their experience of living in muncie as with middletowns everywhere , the city faces difficulties , but it seems these are matched by a strong and active community willing to take them on lauren bishop weidner , who taught english at ball state university for 15 years , told us your first impression of muncie is probably going to be inaccurate most people come in on the east or west side on mcgalliard avenue and you just see box store after box store but if you go through the neighbourhoods you see diversity and spirit , especially downtown you need to go all the way through muncie before you decide what you think jason donati family photo 2016jason donati family photo 2016jason donati , 36 , has four children , grew up in muncie and returned eight years ago he lives in downtown muncie and is an environmental educator for the muncie sanitary district he is also the co founder of race muncie , which stands for reconciliation achieved through community engagement there are jobs in muncie i know people in economic development and there are a lot of jobs which dont have enough qualified people its easy to say we havent got jobs , that weve been screwed over by nafta the north american free trade agreement we have all felt the effects of losing the automotive industry , thats true , but what working class white people have to deal with here is the issue of addiction ive been to a lot of funerals of my friends the drugs are so much stronger , people in their mid 30s with small children are now dying through recreational use its doubling and tripling and heroin is catching up with meth theres a lack of resources in the community for mental health , counselling and healing the only thing im seeing elected officials do is bust the cases , it needs to be addressed as a disease i lost my middle brother to drugs in 2005 its something you deal with your entire life thats my motivation , i think about my brother and the impact its had on my life , and its a rare privilege to live another day i learned through my two years with americorps that you have to get out and serve im running for the muncie community school board and if i get elected i can help address some of these issues pheobechris allen , 32 , is the community development block grant coordinator for hamilton county , indiana , helping communities fund activities such as affordable housing , public service programmes and infrastructure projects he was born and raised in anderson , about 20 minutes south west of muncie , went to ball state university and has mostly lived in muncie ever since in muncie , anderson and the surrounding communities , up until the 1980s , you could go to high school and graduating was optional you could drop out , get a job at gm , or borgwarner , or delco remy , working on the line my dad worked there , three quarters of my elementary class parents worked there you got married , had the family and the income , health benefits , retirement benefits you could achieve the american dream you had the ranch house , ran two cars and , more importantly , could afford to take your family on vacation , going to the lakes or down to florida now , thats a luxury these kinds of dreams have been lost , and i think thats a major driving force of this election fifty years ago muncie was a boom town , what are we going to do to get that back \?

but it is not a given that the fed will hike in december , says economist james knightley at ing bank there is little in the statement to suggest that a december hike is definitely going to happen \( markets currently pricing in a 67 chance of a move \) the statement comments that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen while adding the word some to the line that it wants to wait for some further evidence of continued progress towards its objectives this all suggests that things are moving in the right direction , but the presidential election is an obvious reason for waiting assuming clinton wins , markets are likely to react with relief given expectations of policy continuity this , coupled with the reasonably firm growth , rising employment and a gradual pick up in inflation should reinforce market expectations for a december rate hike should trump win then this is likely to hurt market sentiment given uncertainty as to what he will actually do when in power it is hard to imagine the fed hiking in this environment we also have plenty more data to come ahead of the december 14 fomc meeting , including two more job reports so there are other reasons for caution the fed statement has failed to give much support to the dollar , and us markets have struggled for direction after the news the dow jones industrial average is now down 33 points , compared to around 70 ahead of the statement the us dollar index has lost 0 3 to 97 38 gregory daco \( gregdaco \) fed fomc statement us economy chugging along , inflation expectations

strengthen fed remains on track for dec rate hikenovember 2 , 2016 although there was no rate change today , it looks increasingly likely there will be one in december paul sirani , chief market analyst at xtrade , said with just days to go before election fever sweeps america , janet yellens federal interest rate statement held no shocks with rates remaining the same however , its becoming ever more likely that yellen will implement a raise early next month following signs that the american economy is gradually picking up steam she made clear in september that a rise before the end of 2016 was more than likely and with employment and inflation continuing to strengthen the central bank may get its wish the fed has dropped a reference to inflation remaining low in the near term in september it said inflation is expected to remain low in the near term , in part because of earlier declines in energy prices , but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further this now reads inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further the fed said in its statement the committee expects that , with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy , economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced the committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments against this backdrop , the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 4 to 1 2 percent the committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided , for the time being , to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative , thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation this time there were only two fed dissenters who wanted to raise rates not three , esther george and loretta mester eric rosengren , who voted for a rise last time , has now sided with the majority breaking newsto no ones great surprise , the federal reserve has opted to leave us interest rates unchanged just days ahead of the presidential election it said it was waiting for further evidence of progress towards its objectives before hiking anthony cheung \( awmcheung \) awaiting any subtle change in fomc language to hint towards dec hike look out for next meeting or further strengthened november 2 , 2016 the us federal reserves interest rate decision will be released in less than an hour while most commentators expect there to be no change not this close to the presidential election the prospect of a rate rise in december is thought to be reasonably likely , given the recent reassuring us economic data there is likely to be a focus as usual on the exact wording of the fed statement and whether it shows any changes from the september comments at that meeting seven of the fed members voted for no change , with three , esther george , loretta mester , and eric rosengren , backing an increase any variance here could also give a clue to the likely outcome in december investors have been unnerved by suggestions that donald trump is gaining ground in the us presidential race , with one poll this week even showing him in the lead over hillary clinton combined with a slump in oil prices following a record weekly rise in us crude stocks , this has pushed markets in europe sharply lower but on wall street the dow jones industrial average , which lost 100 points or so on tuesday , has not been hit as badly \( so far \) , and is currently down just 20 points ahead of the latest us federal reserve interest rate decision meanwhile the vix index of volatility , seen as a gauge of investor fears , is up 3 to 19 when clinton looked a shoo in to win , the index was hovering around 13 but despite this recent rise , it is still well below the 25 level it reached after the brexit vote in june jasper lawler , market analyst at cmc markets , said less than a week out from the us election and markets are demonstrating both complacency and a palpable fear at the same time a surge in the vix index shows volatility is on the rise and investors are hedging equity exposure with safe havens like gold and government bonds but at the same time equity benchmarks are only modestly down , showing an overriding comfort in owning stocks the vix is up over 40 in the last seven days , reaching above 18 , a level in which many investors sit up and pay attention to signs of heightened risk in the market over that same period the ftse 100 and s p 500 are down 2 3 there is still a general perception that hillary clinton will take the white house , but the surprise brexit result is fresh in minds of investors and they are buying gold and vix index tracking products to hedge their bets the final scores in europe showed the ftse 100 fell 71 72 points or 1 04 to 6845 42 , its lowest level since 27 septembergermanys dax dropped 1 47 to 10 , 370 93frances

pic twitter com yywjzduxfwnovember 2 , 2016 with investors spooked by the prospect of donald trump possibly winning the us election , not to mention the plunge in oil prices following the jump in us crude stocks , markets remain under pressure the ftse 100 is currently down 0 9 , germanys dax has dropped 1 2 and frances cac has lost 1 1 on wall street , the dow jones industrial average has not been so badly hit and is currently 0 2 lower that could mean that investors are not necessarily convinced by polls showing trump in the lead kathleen brooks , research director at city index , said the markets are not in full on panic mode right now , suggesting that they still think clinton could clinch a win next week this is reflected in the vix volatility index , which is considered a fear gauge for wall street even though it has risen in recent days it is still below 20 , to put this in context , after the brexit vote in june volatility spiked above 25 global stock markets are generally lower on wednesday , but us markets have outperformed their european counterparts even with 6 days to go before the us election interestingly , the dow jones transport index , considered a lead indicator for wall street , is higher today considering a trump presidency is considered the worst outcome for the us economy , the fact that this index has not fallen further on the back of the bad poll news for the clinton camp , suggests that the us equity market may not sell off sharply until volatility spikes further , or until the actual result is confirmed but the other potentially market moving event is the us federal reserve interest rate announcement later brooks said the market is expecting a 14 chance of a hike tonight if the fed does hike , that would throw the cat among the pigeons , and we could see a steeper sell off in equities , a rally in bond yields and a broad based recovery in the dollar however , in our view the bigger risk from todays meeting could be a dovish slant from the federal reserve , who may not want to commit to a rate hike until the election result is confirmed although the fed is expected to be politically neutral , a potential market sell off on the back of a win for trump next week could put the prospect of a december rate hike to bed for the fed added to this , the fed chair and vice chair have given speeches with fairly dovish slants in recent weeks , so a sell off in the dollar on wednesday could be in advance of a dovish shock from the fed later on today jamie mcgeever \( reutersjamie \) 50 fading fast brent crude oil 12

people are surprised when i express support for hillary clinton my economic politics are hard to the left and , unlike hers , explicitly socialist but its entirely because my analysis of inequality is economic that i endorse clinton not as a least worst option , not even due to the nature of her opponent , but on her own terms as a leader pledged to the material improvement of womens economic and social reality this is a structurally radical framework for broad based american change yet over the course of many a bleating bro beating on the internet , the dread realisation has landed with me that among too many men who identify themselves as on the left , notions of what constitutes social progress and radical redress of inequality are gendered concepts with the result that clintons activist leadership is wilfully dismissed time magazine may have called clinton a cultural revolutionary , but the bernie bros are having none of it if youre a woman whos supported clinton online at any point youll know which bros i mean stop right there assuming a hillary clinton victory is downright dangerous kate aronoff read moretheyre the self proclaimed progressive gentlemen who insist that bernie sanders was robbed of the democratic nomination , despite his loss by more than 2 5m votes in the primaries whether brogressives , brocialists or manarchists , they denounce clintons claim on american left leadership despite her popular nomination , policy , activist record , her spoken statements or her trouncing of donald trump in three debates there must be scrutiny of any candidate for office but it comes with an obsessional viciousness towards clinton in these mannish parts of the left the australian writer jane caro described an experience of praising clinton and being abused , sneered at , patronised \( oh my god , how you will be patronised \) and sent endless propaganda purporting to prove shes corrupt , a criminal , a murderer , a warmonger etc ive received this propaganda too clintons critics cite unstructured blog posts about petrodollars , blame her for the us mire in the middle east , and post links to rough edit youtube videos proclaiming her ownership by the banks the alpha bro outfit wikileaks has fuelled some old school conspiracy theories by tweeting sly suggestions that shes a puppet of the rothschilds there are those who unbelievably insist shes just as bad as trump such ardent behaviour is global , and unrestricted to those us citizens who can determine the election its been described by female writers across the world as they simultaneously explain the phenomenon of silent hillary supporters since the primaries exposed this behaviour , vast communities have formed of women organising secret facebook groups so they can praise , analyse and debate concerns about the clinton candidacy without abuse im in two of them an australian and american one there are thousands more , and various groups run into memberships of thousands its not just leftwing women , either an article in marie claire observed the phenomenon of evangelical women in conservative communities secretly organising for clinton as well why theres open hostility by certain men towards clinton as well as how her female voting base is locked down in their support for her is simplistically explained as an act of and response to sexism but there are more complex and nuanced elements here that apply to a broader western conversation about policy priorities problems of pay inequality , parental leave and access to affordable childcare exist across the western world because of the scarcity within political leadership of those who fight for womens causes beyond lip service and make actual legislative change fighting inequality in the us and global context has defined clintons political engagement for her entire career her campaign is unashamed in its commitment to womens policy as an australian , i look upon the opportunity americans have to exercise a vote for her with envy the hatred of clinton from the testosterone left is a dangerous , self defeating omission from those who insist theirs is a project of fairness clinton has progressed from community activist to presidential candidate with relentless dedication to equality causes entirely because of her own redefinition of the first lady role , its hard to imagine now how groundbreaking it was when she told the un that it is no longer acceptable to discuss womens rights as separate from human rights in beijing in 1995 or when she published it takes a village , arguing that childcare is a collective social responsibility , in 1996 or that she is credited with the creation of an office on violence against women at the department of justice in her busy senatorial career , she championed access to contraception as a womens rights issue , fought for the paycheck fairness act and co sponsored the lilly ledbetter bill for fair pay , as well as campaigning for paid parental leave for us public servants her tenure as secretary of state was characterised by her unprecedented centralisation of gender equality strategies to foreign policy , creating a structure for participation of women in peace processes and recognition of rape as a weapon of war , which was subsequently adopted by the un let 's learn from the mistakes that created us poverty , not copy them van badham read moreher nuanced understanding and dogged defence of womens autonomy and the right to choose has been hailed as glorious given the dangerous polarisation of the abortion issue in the us shes never abandoned her dedication to improving access to childcare it is a central feature of her present campaign and her candidacy for president has been marked by her advocacy for fairness for women and children , equal pay , reproductive rights , health equality and family and carers leave while women fight these ongoing battles for recognition and redress of our structural disadvantage , it exposes the privilege of cabinet ministers , wikileaks wannabes and bernie bros alike that they can trivialise , minimise or ignore them there is more at stake in the us election than one candidates victory and anothers defeat , far more than who should gain the levers of an economy far more even than who deserves access to the us armoury clinton is not just the most qualified candidate for election not only does she have a singular , expert history of activism , leadership and service that recommends her on her own terms shes a candidate whose policy , practice , life and very person are inextricable from the political cause of equality in a democratic choice reduced to two options , to reject her for her opponent amounts to a rejection of equality as a political project for those of us who lack the privileges conferred on others at their birth , should clinton lose its not only the result that will be devastating , but the consequences , too topicshillary

insisting they see no evidence of a negative impact from fridays new fbi email disclosures house speaker paul ryan has repaid donald trump for months of acrimony including a refusal to endorse ryan by

the off the cuff departures that tend to characterize his rallies in your poolers humble opinion , trump has not stayed this on message in any other public rally since the republican national convention your pooler would bet an expensive lunch that he diverted very little from his prepared remarks wisconsin senator ron johnson , who is expected to cruise to reelection victory in next weeks election despite fellow republican donald trumps underwater polling numbers in the state , told the beloit daily news that hillary clintons use of private email servers are impeachable offenses she purposefully circumvented the law , this was willful concealment and destruction , johnson said im not a lawyer , but this is clearly written i would say yes , high crime or misdemeanor , i believe she is in violation of both laws johnson referred to two laws regarding the willful destruction or removal from proper custody of information relating to the national defense , the punishment for which includes fines and the forfeiture of holding elected office johnson dismissed the conclusion by the fbi that clinton did not break the law that was a corrupt conclusion , johnson said every election is a binary choice , but she has disqualified herself , johnson said of clinton i would love to be voting for ronald reagan , and im sure the democrats would rather be voting for harry truman , but the reality is that is not our choice hundreds of the worlds most respected economists , including eight nobel laureates , have signed and published a letter urging us voters not to support republican presidential nominee donald trump , calling trump a dangerous , destructive choice who would doom the country to recession , or worse donald trump is a dangerous , destructive choice for the country , the letter asserts , after listing off more than a dozen reasons for voters to support a different candidate he misinforms the electorate , degrades trust in public institutions with conspiracy theories , and promotes willful delusion over engagement with reality if elected , he poses a unique danger to the functioning of democratic and economic institutions , and to the prosperity of the country for these reasons , we strongly recommend that you do not vote for donald trump the letters 370 signatories , which include oliver hart of harvard university , one of the two nobel winners in economics this year , and paul romer , the chief economist at the world bank , accuse trump of , in order degrading trust in vital public institutions that collect and disseminate information about the economy , including the bureau of labor statistics misleading voters by asserting that the renegotiation of nafta or the imposition of tariffs on china would substantially increase employment in manufacturing trump has diverted the policy discussion to options that ignore both the reality of technological progress and the benefits of international trade he has misled the public by asserting that us manufacturing has declined falsely suggesting that the toughness of negotiators primarily drives trade deficits misleading american voters with false statements about trade agreements eroding national income and wealth lowering the seriousness of public discussions of the national debt and deficits by suggesting that eliminating the environmental protection agency or the department of education would significantly reduce the fiscal deficit he claims he will eliminate the fiscal deficit , but has proposed a plan that would decrease tax revenue by 2 6 to 5 9 trillion over the next decade according to the non partisan tax foundation proposing a reduction in public saving that is likely to increase the us trade deficit using immigration as a red herring to mislead voters about issues of economic importance misleading the electorate by declaring that the us is one of the most heavily taxed countries his statements reveal a deep ignorance of economics and an inability to listen to credible experts , the letters signatories conclude he repeats fake and misleading economic statistics , and pushes fallacies about the vat and trade competitiveness he promotes magical thinking and conspiracy theories over sober assessments of feasible economic policy options polls are often conducted over multiple days , so were only just starting to measure the effect of the fbis decision to release new details of its investigation into hillary clintons private email server to lawmakers on friday according to the abc washington post tracking poll published on tuesday \( conducted october 27 30 \) , the democratic candidate has now slipped behind donald trump , on 45 to her republican opponents 46 the polling average calculated by realclearpolitics , a much better indication of national sentiment , shows clinton is now leading by just 2 percentage points , down from 5 percentage points a week ago those numbers are interesting but not necessarily indicative polling wont neatly translate to votes far more important will be the turnout especially since the two leading presidential candidates are so close in terms of unpopularity and the candidates know it a senior adviser to donald trump reportedly revealed last week that we have three major voter suppression operations under way intended to reduce votes for clinton among african americans , white liberals and young women even though election day is still a week away , we already have some clues about whether turnout is lower among those groups because more than 25m ballots have already been cast under the us early voting system approximately 125 million to 145 million americans are predicted to vote in the 2016 election , so those early votes represent a significant share of the expected total higher turnout than at this time in 2012of the 15 states that provide detailed information about those ballots , north carolina , california and nine other states report more early voters than at the same point in the 2012 election ohio , nevada , colorado and iowa showed a decline in early voting , and those declines were small early signs of declining turnout from black voters and young votersthe early results offer mixed news for clinton early votes suggest that young voters who are much more likely than older voters to lean democratic might be staying at home in 12 states , fewer americans aged 18 to 29 have cast a ballot so far in this election compared with this point in 2012 this could be especially problematic for clinton if this group is indicative of a broader bernie or bust sentiment in which supporters of the former democratic candidate bernie sanders choose to stay at home rather than voting for clinton young voters arent the only demographic group that appears put off early votes suggest that black turnout has fallen in eight states especially in north carolina , a state that yields 15 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the election and where polling suggests clinton is in a close contest if trumps strategy is indeed to suppress the black vote , that makes a lot of sense those voters could be crucial for clinton to secure the white house election polls tighten but turnout is the real key to clinton v trump read more speaking in eau claire , wisconsin , donald trump predicted an unprecedented constitutional crisis if hillary clinton were to be elected president the work of government would come to an unbelievably unglorious halt , trump said , and she is likely to be investigated for years , likely to be concluded with a very large scale criminal trial the audience chanted lock her up ! in response this is a message for any democratic voter who have already cast their ballot for hillary clinton and have a severe case of buyers remorse , trump said , referring to a few states wisconsin included where early ballots can be reversed before election day a lot of stuff has come out since youve voted you can change your vote to donald trump well make america great again , okay \? she will never make america great speaking in eau claire , wisconsin , republican presidential nominee donald trump

the pound may indeed fall to 1 15 as bank of america merrill lynch has suggested , but at the moment it is holding fairly steady against the us currency sterling is currently down just 0 07 at 1 2234 , but this is mainly thanks to dollar weakness due to renewed uncertainty surrounding the us election , not to mention wednesdays interest rate decision from the federal reserve neil wilson , market analyst at etx capital , said a poll from abc that gave trump a slender lead over clinton has been the catalyst for some fairly significant risk off moves given how far ahead in the polls clinton was very recently , the fact that were talking about a close race again is clearly rattling investors suffice to say we can expect more volatility in the coming week against the euro the pound is not faring so well , down 0 , 77 at 1 1064 heres some gloom from pro brexit fund manager crispin odey , who has told investors the uk could face recession and the stock market could slump by 80 bloomberg reported crispin odey , whose main hedge fund has lost about 43 percent this year , says u k stocks could slump 80 percent as the economy is roiled by a recession and higher inflation following the vote to leave the european union shares will come under pressure after the ftse 100 share index climbed 30 percent over five years even as earnings fell by 80 percent , the money manager said in a letter to investors last week seen by bloomberg news we are now destined to have a recession in the u k as well as inflation , odey wrote it will be difficult for the stock market to remain above all of this a host of badly received results from standard chartered to bp to shire and pfizer has helped push markets lower , not to mention renewed uncertainty over the us election a poll showing donald trump leading hillary clinton ahead of next weeks votes has unnerved investors while mixed us figures good manufacturing , poor construction just added to the downbeat mood chris beauchamp , chief market analyst at ig , said despite two attempts at a rally today , the ftse 100 remains in the red european markets have had it far worse , with the dax losing over 1 today , with euro strength helping to take the shine off markets on the continent that have enjoyed a recent spate of outperformance compared to london with us markets taking a hit this afternoon as well it doesnt take sherlock holmes to work out that the new polls giving donald trump an edge in the election are spooking investors the parallels with brexit are there for everyone to see , but the key battleground states are still leaning towards the democrats in all probability , the election will still turn out as expected , but the markets nagging doubts are clearly getting the better of it this afternoon the final scores in europe showed the ftse 100 finished down 37 08 points or 0 53 at 6917 14germanys dax dropped 1 3 to 10 , 526 16frances cac closed 0 86 lower at 4470 28italys ftse mib fell 1 32 to 16 , 898

analysts say buy gold whoever wins the us election bloomberg reports although they deem a donald trump victory more supportive for the price of the metal than a win by hillary clinton , the banks chief precious metals analyst james steel says itll enjoy at least a 8 percent jump whoever wins the race both candidates have espoused trade policies that could stimulate demand , with gold offering a potential protection against protectionism , he says even the relatively more internationalist democratic candidate has argued for the renegotiation of longstanding free trade agreements thats positive for gold even if not on the scale of mr trumps agenda if the real estate magnate triumphs , gold could rise to 1 , 500 an ounce , according to hsbc , up from around 1 , 289 at 10 55 a m in new york if clinton wins , the price of the metal could improve to 1 , 400 an ounce by year end , steel writes , adding that a democratic sweep of congress would further stoke demand for the metal owing to a possible boost in fiscal spending on gold , jasper lawler at cmc markets said weakness in the us dollar and rising uncertainty from presidential nominee donald trump rising in the polls saw gold breakout to a three week high the gold price has continued to climb after cftc commodity futures trading commission data showed the first rise in net long positions in four weeks gold appears to be being accumulated as a hedge against equity market declines before the us election in times of uncertainty , gold and silver are seen as havens for investors and so it is proving at the moment ,

he was called jack he wrote about his zest for experience , about the exhilaration of riding box cars , about being an american hobo and a stranger in a strange land he travelled around with kin brothers and painted fantastic word pictures of drinking under the night sky , lying with a newspaper under his head above me the stars were winking and wheeling in squadrons back and forth as the train rounded the curves but he didnt write a book called on the road in 1907 , 50 years before jack kerouacs novel became a bestseller , jack london wrote his own masterpiece , called , wait for it , the road without that vivid and extraordinary memoir , the second half of the 20th century would have looked a whole lot different london was the daddy o of the beats he even looked the part , with his dark good looks and penchant for leather jackets more importantly , he both walked the walk and talked the talk his life story is astonishing as detailed in the road , he tramped the length and breadth of the us in 1894 , aged just 18 before that , hed spent long brutal hours working in cannery factories and sailing on seal ships bound for japan romantically , he got most of his education sitting at a makeshift desk in a saloon the owner took such a shine to him , he paid for him to go to university in true beat style , london dropped out later , he sailed down the mississippi on a raft , then joined the klondike gold rush , got scurvy and discovered leftwing politics oh , and he wrote more than 20 novels , a good handful of nonfiction books , and dozens of short stories before expiring , aged just 40 , in the late stages of alcoholism , hopped up on morphine and with a body wrecked by hard years of use and abuse so its easy to see why kerouac always named london as a foundational influence and why he might have been the only author to get a namecheck in on the road but jack london is more than just a proto beat he was also a profound influence on ernest hemingway , sinclair lewis and norman mailer lenin liked him , too in her book memories of lenin , the revolutionary leaders wife nadezhda krupskaya said that when the revolutionary leader was dying she read him a tale by london love of life it is still lying on the table in his room it was a very fine story in a wilderness of ice , where no human being had set foot , a sick man , dying of hunger , is making for the harbour of a big river his strength is giving out , he cannot walk but keeps slipping , and beside him there slides a wolf also dying of hunger there is a fight between them the man wins half dead , half demented , he reaches his goal that tale greatly pleased ilyich \( lenin \) next day he asked me to read him more jack london it must have helped , of course , that for a long time , london was a fellow traveller he was a sharp critic of the inequalities and injustices of the gilded age in which he lived thats part of the reason george orwell \( whom london inspired to write down and out in paris and london \) also found him so interesting and why london still feels all too relevant , this month , 100 years after his death , as we endure a second gilded age of rampant inequality , overweening press barons , and gold plated political monsters its sad to say that his depictions of dire poverty in people of the abyss , and of the surveillance state in the iron heel , still have plenty to teach us but before i paint jack london as some kind of leftwing saint , i should also point out that he was more complicated \( and more interesting \) than that he eventually left the socialist party of which he was a member he enjoyed both earning and spending huge amounts of money , dressing in fine clothes and enjoying the high life in an essay quoting the passage above from krupskaya , orwell says that krupskaya went on to read her husband a second story from london that turned out to be saturated with bourgeois morals , and ilyich smiled and dismissed it with a wave of his hand less amusingly , london also held plenty of the less appealing social darwinist and racial theories of his age and indulged a cult of the nordic orwell says london could foresee fascism because he had a fascist streak in himself or at any rate a marked strain of brutality and an almost unconquerable preference for the strong man as against the weak man while he took on londons character , orwell also had a few choice words about his mentors prose london is a very uneven writer in his short and restless life he poured forth an immense quantity of work , setting himself to produce 1 , 000 words every day and generally achieving it that shouldnt put us off , however although orwell complained that much of this work was scamped and unconvincing , he also conceded that london produced at least six volumes which deserve to stay in print , and that is not a bad achievement from a life of 40 years annoyingly , orwell doesnt name which six and confusingly he singles out at least seven for praise the road , the jacket , before adam , the valley of the moon , the iron heel , people of the abyss , and a collection of short stories , love of life and other stories that list might give us a good place for us to start as we make a selection for this months reading group although , of course , that would be to ignore londons most famous \( and brilliant \) novels white fang and the call of the wild theres a fine list to choose from as often , well put it to the vote to nominate your favourite , just name it in the comments below if you could give a reason , that would be fantastic but its not compulsory ill come back in a few days to tot up the totals just to add to the fun , since he wrote so much , and since so many of his books are so short , im tempted to try and look at two works this month , so feel free to name more than one topicsbooksreading groupjack kerouacgeorge orwelljack londonshare on facebookshare on twittershare via

whats the problem with hillary clintons emails \? clinton used a private email server , situated in her new york home , while she was secretary of state , from 2009 to 2013 she has admitted that this was a mistake in july , the fbi concluded that clinton and her aides had been extremely careless in their handling of classified information but should not face criminal charges the issue has dogged the democrats campaign for the presidency , with supporters of republican rival donald trump regularly chanting lock her up ! clinton emails fbi gets warrant as comey told he may have broken law read morewhat just happened \? on friday , fbi director james comey alerted members of congress to the existence of a new batch of emails he said could be pertinent to the investigation as many as 650 , 000 messages were reportedly found on a laptop seized during an unrelated investigation of anthony weiner , a former new york congressman who is the estranged husband of longtime clinton aide huma abedin abedin and weiner separated after weiner was caught in 2011 , 2013 and again in 2016 sending women sexually explicit text messages and pictures of himself undressed federal authorities in new york and north carolina are investigating online communications between weiner and a 15 year old girl senior officials at the department of justice expressed concern that comeys decision to inform congress would be inconsistent with protocols designed to avoid the appearance of interference in an election but the fbi director went ahead what is in the emails \? we dont know comey himself admitted the fbi cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant those mails with a connection to clintons server could merely be duplicates of emails already analysed or they could contain a smoking gun that compromises clinton even after the election on sunday , the fbi obtained a warrant to begin reviewing the newly discovered emails the process will not be finished before election day what was the reaction to comeys announcement \? the timing , less than two weeks before a presidential election , drew harsh criticism from democrats and even some republicans at an organising event in daytona beach , clinton called comeys actions unprecedented and deeply troubling her campaign launched an all out war on comey chairman john podesta said by providing selective information , hes allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because comey has not been forthcoming with the facts the wider democratic establishment also weighed in four senators demanded a briefing from comey and nearly 100 former department of justice officials and prosecutors , both republican and democratic and led by the former obama attorney general eric holder , signed a letter criticising comeys decision the trump campaign , meanwhile , was elated we never thought we were going to say thank you to anthony weiner , the republican presidential nominee told a rally in nevada did comey abuse his power \? the nearly 100 former officials criticised his actions in their open letter , which was released by the clinton campaign director comeys letter is inconsistent with prevailing department policy , and it breaks with longstanding practices followed by officials of both parties during past elections , they said in another scathing letter to comey , the democratic senate minority leader , harry reid of nevada , accused him of clear intent to aid one party over another i am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the hatch act , which bars fbi officials from using their official authority to influence an election , reid wrote through your partisan actions , you may have broken the law richard painter , chief white house ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 , said he had filed a complaint against the fbi for a possible violation of the hatch act what is the hatch act \? passed in 1939 , it forbids anyone in the executive branch \( apart from the president or vice president \) from using his or her official position to engage in political activity carolyn lerner , head of the us office of special counsel , wrote in the new york times five years ago at its best , the act prevents people in political power from abusing their positions it prohibits coercion by a government supervisor such as pressuring employees to volunteer for or contribute to a campaign and shields the civil service and the federal workplace from politicking in july , the housing secretary , julian castro , was found to have violated the hatch act when he expressed support for clinton comeys action , however , is less blatantly partisan and a case against him would be tough to prove in court the republican congressman trey gowdy told fox news on monday it is laughable that jim comey committed a violation of the hatch act i actually know what the hatch act is demonstrating a selective reading of the act , he continued if the president of the united states actively campaigning on company time for another candidate to be president of the united states is not a violation of the hatch act , then how is jim comey supplementing the record and telling the truth to congress a violation of the hatch act \? harry reid knows that this is not a violation so why did comey do it \? will hillary clinton lose the us election because of the fbi email investigation \? read morehe told fbi colleagues in a memo on friday he was aware his letter was at risk of being misunderstood , but felt obliged to notify congress about the new emails after having told lawmakers that the matter was closed there have been reports that some members of the fbi were in revolt over comeys earlier decision not to recommend charges against clinton , and that he feared word of the new email investigation would leak to the media , leading to accusations of a cover up , especially if it happened after 8 november he therefore regarded going public now as the least worst option will these events affect the election result \? possible but not probable more than 23 million people have already voted and there is little evidence of movement so far clinton still has a three point lead over trump , according to a politico morning consult poll conducted after comeys intervention and a cbs yougov survey of likely voters across 13 battleground states showed that only 1 of clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her after the announcement her campaign said its own volunteers had been fired up and this would kill any danger of complacency nevertheless , trump believes he has some fresh momentum from a saga he has described as bigger than watergate whichever candidate is dominating the headlines tends to find their poll ratings going down clinton probably has enough of a cushion but the bombshell might yet affect tight races for the house and senate this article was amended on 1 november 2016 an earlier version described harry reid as the house minority leader he is leader of the democrats in the senate topicshillary clintonus elections 2016us politicsfbidemocratsnewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
the clinton campaign has accused fbi director james comey of jaw dropping double standards for releasing news of a fresh investigation into hillary clintons private email server while apparently withholding evidence of russian support for donald trump in case it were to influence next weeks election clintons spokespeople pointed to reports by cnbc and the huffington post claiming that comey privately urged against naming russia for apparently interfering in the election and hacking democratic email accounts , with campaign manager robby mook saying the decision to hold back defied all

and cooperative a five byline new york times story reports that republican presidential nominee donald trump availed himself of a tax avoidance method in the early 1990s so legally hazy that trumps own lawyers warned him that the internal revenue service \( irs \) would deem it improper under audit the maneuver , the new york times reports , helped trump avoid reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in cancelled debt resulting from the failure of one of trumps casino businesses as taxable income the irs views cancelled debt in the same light as taxable income which would normally mean that after the floundering of trumps atlantic city casino business and the subsequent cancellation of hundreds of millions of dollars in debt , trump would have to pay taxes on that cancelled debt as income the strategy known among tax practitioners as a stock for debt swap relies on mathematical sleight of hand say a company can repay only 60 million of a 100 million bank loan if the bank forgives the remaining 40 million , the company faces a large tax bill because it will have to report that canceled 40 million debt as taxable income clever tax lawyers found a way around this inconvenience the company would simply swap stock for the 40 million in debt it could not repay this way , it would look as if the entire 100 million loan had been repaid , and presto there would be no tax bill due for 40 million in canceled debt the trump campaign dismissed the times allegations , which are based on documents uncovered during a search of casino bankruptcy filings from the 1990s your e mail suggests either a fundamental misunderstanding or an intentional misreading of the law , trump campaign press secretary hope hicks told the new york times your thesis is a criticism , not just of mr trump , but of all taxpayers who take the time and spend the money to try to comply with the dizzyingly complex and ambiguous tax laws without paying more tax than they owe mr trump does

the white house on monday highlighted concerns over the fbi directors decision to announce that the bureau is examining whether newly discovered emails may be relevant to its investigation of hillary clintons use of a private email server fbi director james comey may be under investigation for hatch act violation read morepress secretary josh earnest was careful to say fbi director james comey is regarded by barack obama as a man of integrity and principle but he also noted the importance of longstanding tradition and practice and norms and warned of the risk of communicating with congress earnest said one senior republican official already had suggested that his party was considering impeaching a future president clinton comey has faced a fierce backlash for going public with the new fbi investigation just 11 days before a presidential election , reportedly against the advice and guidelines of attorney general loretta lynch and other senior figures at the department of justice on sunday the fbi obtained a search warrant to begin reviewing the emails , reportedly numbering 650 , 000 and found on the laptop of anthony weiner , estranged husband of clinton aide huma abedin on monday , a spokesman for the office of special counsel indicated that the independent federal agency may be investigating comey over an alleged violation of the hatch act , which guards against federal officials seeking to influence an election at a white house press briefing , earnest said much that could be interpreted as critical of comey , though he declined to do so explicitly the president believes that our democracy has been very well served for more than two centuries by officials at the department of justice and the fbi observing longstanding traditions that limit public discussion of investigations , whether an election is around the corner or not , he said it is clear what director comey has done whats not clear is what led to the decision nobody at the white house has insight into the decision that director comey made im not aware of any of the factors that went into director comeys decision to send this letter to congress on friday asked if the incident could affect the election outcome , earnest replied we certainly have already seen some of secretary clintons harshest critics capitalise on this letter , distort its contents to provoke controversy comeys letter to congress , stating that the fbi is examining newly discovered information that might be pertinent to clintons use of a private email server as secretary of state , has placed a widely respected fbi director in extraordinary political jeopardy earnest dismissed any notion that congress could be seen as an impartial oversight body weve already seen just in the last 72 hours the kind of risk thats associated with communicating to them sensitive information , he said theres one senior republican official , who had previously endorsed the republican nominee for president , whos let it slip that his party was considering impeaching president clinton even before shes been elected , if shes elected facebook twitter pinterest trump whod have thought wed be thanking weiner \? that i think is a pretty clear indication that congress is not at all impartial and thats why many of these norms that apply even when were not talking about someone famous and even when were not talking about an election a week and a half away , should apply the president believes these norms are important and worth upholding the press secretary was at pains to defend comey as an individual , if not his actions in this case the presidents assessment of his integrity and character has not changed , he said for example , the president doesnt believe that director comey is intentionally trying to influence the outcome of an election the president doesnt believe that hes secretly strategising to benefit one candidate or one political party huma abedin has hillary clinton 's closest ally become her biggest liability \? read morehes in a tough spot and hes the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts , including individuals who served in senior department of justice positions and administrations that were led by presidents in both parties but im just not going to be in a position to frankly defend or criticise the decisions that hes made with regard to what to communicate in public an emboldened donald trump has described the revelation as bigger than watergate , but there is little initial evidence the news has upended the presidential race a morning consult politico poll carried out after the announcement put clinton three points ahead , while a cbs yougov survey of likely voters in 13 battleground states showed that only 1 of clinton supporters were less likely to vote for her as a consequence trump claimed on monday that the fbi had stumbled across a digital mother lode and predicted they would discover missing work related emails that had been deleted from clintons computers 650 , 000 emails \? i think you are going to find the 33 , 000 that are missing , he told supporters in michigan i think we hit the mother lode , as they say in the mining industry trump urged comey to resist political pressure hes gotta hang tough because a lot of people think he did the wrong thing , but he did the right thing , he told the grand rapids rally i was not his fan but what he did he brought back his reputation it took guts for director comey to do what he did , he added , to chants of lock her up from the crowd trump has seized on signs of momentum to push into once safe democratic territory in the industrial mid west he was also due to speak in warren in michigan on monday before appearing with running mate mike pence in eau claire , wisconsin , on tuesday until his polling gap began to narrow again last week , trump had been forced back to a dwindling number of swing states , while clinton eyed republican territory in utah , arizona and georgia renewed optimism among republicans has created an unusually vast national battleground , particularly as trumps economic populism scrambles traditional demographic dividing lines michigan and wisconsin have both been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing jobs and were the scene of surprise defeats for clinton in the democratic primary , when large numbers of blue collar workers favoured bernie sanders signs of democratic nervousness in wisconsin became apparent last week when the clinton campaign suddenly announced an advertising blitz sanders has been dispatched to help campaign for clinton in the state on wednesday the impact of early voting may also be forcing trump to look further afield states such as a north carolina have seen heavy early turnout among democrats and may be relatively immune from any late swing away from clinton if he cannot win north carolina but picks up florida and ohio , trumps best hope of pulling off a shock victory will rely on either rustbelt states like michigan and wisconsin or , in the north east , new hampshire , pennsylvania and maine clinton is redoubling her efforts two stops on monday in ohio were to be followed by three in florida on tuesday and another swing to north carolina later in the week most people have decided quite a long time ago what they think about all this , she told a rally in ohio on monday now what people are focused upon is choosing the next president and commander in chief there was less direct criticism of the fbi than over the weekend i am sure a lot of you may be asking what this email business is about and why in the world the fbi would decide to jump into an election without any evidence and its a good a question , she said , to boos from a young crowd at kent state university by all mean they should look at the emails and i am sure they will reach the same conclusion as when they looked at my emails there is no case facebook twitter pinterest hillary clinton reacts to new fbi investigation into her emails the office of special counsel \( osc \) declined to confirm to the guardian whether it is investigating comey for violating the hatch act but on saturday , richard painter , a former ethics lawyer in george w bushs white house , filed an official complaint against comey with the office spokesman nick schwellenbach said in general , osc opens a case after receiving a complaint such investigations can take anywhere from days to months should the osc find comey to have violated the hatch act , and should clinton win the presidency , she may find herself in a position to determine appropriate action for an fbi director slated to serve until 2023 the senates top democrat , harry reid , has openly accused comey of breaking the law to help elect trump the likely investigation adds to a swarm of headaches for comey , who awoke on monday to repudiation from former allies hillary clinton 's email controversy explained what we know so far read moreeric holder , the former attorney general who worked beside comey , wrote a public rebuke in the washington post , warning that comey has jeopardized public trust in both the justice department and the fbi it is incumbent upon him or the leadership of the department to dispel the uncertainty he has created before election day , holder wrote holder also joined nearly 100 former federal prosecutors in blasting comey for inviting considerable , uninformed public speculation about the clinton case , before establishing , by the fbi directors admission , investigative relevance the letter , circulated by the clinton campaign , refrained from characterizing comeys motivations but said he had compromised the non partisan traditions of the department and the fbi meanwhile , clinton suffered another blow from a separate source the ongoing wikileaks release of emails from her campaign chairman , john podesta the latest batch appeared to show that donna brazile , the interim head of the democratic national committee and a cnn contributor , gave clinton a heads up about a likely debate question the day before she was due to take on sanders in a primary debate cnn spokeswoman lauren pratapas said cnn never gave brazile access to any questions , prep material , attendee list , background information or meetings in

welcome to this weeks blog , and our roundup of your comments and photos from last week an intriguing and unexpected thread was started by frustratedartist we often read about lost books from the ancient world lost in the sense that every copy of them was destroyed and the text no longer exists or the sole manuscript was destroyed by its author , for example has this ever happened to a printed book \? that is , are there any books published after say 1500 , every single copy , including the manuscript , of which has been lost \? here im thinking of printed and bound books , as opposed to ephemeral publications like leaflets pamphlets magazines etc yosserian supplied an answer whose opening could almost have been the premise of a borges short story perhaps there are lost books , but they are unknown because they lost i know when im rummaging in dusty corners of second hand bookshops , i occasionally unearth books which are so idiosyncratic or personal , i wonder if anyone at all knows of their existence they are often by elderly gentlemen reminiscing about their time at eton , or in the army or something , and must have had small print runs ive often had this notion of creating a museum of forgotten people and lives from stuff i find \( books , letters , photographs \) must be a sentimental resistance denial in my being to our essential ephemerality on this earth one book i did buy was a strange stream of consciousness novel by erica cotterill called it just seemed so wacky and odd , that i wondered if it was a one off , despite having a quote from gb shaw on the cover and while there are maybe a dozen for sale online ranging from 15 quid to 150 , there is almost nothing in the way of discussion or reviews so it might as well be lost i suspect in this sense there are bound to be decent books that if not lost in the sense that they no longer physically exist , are nevertheless thoroughly forgotten , which perhaps amounts to the same thing we also got something close to a definitive \( not to mention beautifully evocative \) answer from interwar when i was working in an antiquarian bookshop in cecil court years ago , a man brought in a box of books hed been lugging up and down charing cross road i said id need time to look at them , but he was so fed up he said hed take 5 right there and then i gave it to him mostly because i felt sorry for him \( one reason i was never the most successful bookseller \) anyway , when i finally did get round to inspecting what was in the box , most of it was worthless , but there was one eighteenth century novel by a woman writer unknown to me , in original boards , virtually in mint condition i looked it up but found nothing the british library did not have a copy , so i sold it to them strangely , i remember what they paid \( 120 \) but not the name of the work or its author the price has stuck in my mind because i felt guilty about only giving the seller 5 elsewhere , daveportivo has been appreciating grayson perrys the descent of man i have to say i think its fabulous look hes not a cutting edge expert on gender studies or much of scientist \( obviously \) , but i found this book very profound in addressing the pressures and psychological stresses of the male gender role now that sounds very theoretical , but what i loved about the book is how personable and how human it is it really struck me when he described behaviours that have either blighted my life in the past or that i continue to struggle with fannery oconnors wise blood also got the thumbs up from sydneyh ive finished by flannery oconnor , which was just adorable the prose is perfect , and the action is consistently amusing i wasnt as sure about the introduction by v s pritchett , which claimed that there is not a trace of satire in her , instead reading oconnor as a realist , a fabulist and moralist i felt that she was definitely satirising a number of start up religions , of which there are many im now interested in finding out if her short stories are similar to me she didnt seem stylistically so much like faulkner and mccarthy as like nathanael west , and i really enjoyed it following on from webberexpats demolition job on valis in a previous tls , bmaclean came to the authors defence , saying his later novels have plenty to recommend them in fact , id rate valis in particular as one of the very best novels ever written by an american dick was indeed striving to come to terms with experiences that he himself feared might have been borderline psychotic episodes , and reinterpreted them obsessively in these last works i found that struggle , as reflected through pkds very real literary talent , intensely fascinating he dealt with it in books like and as standard \( pkd standard , that is \) science fiction novels , in as what might perhaps be described as straight \( again by pkd standards \) fiction , and most compellingly in as experimental , fictionalised autobiography not to mention his personal notes and journals , some of which have now been published , though i havent yet read any of this material maybe this is such a personal reaction that it cant be conveyed to other people , but i would urge potential readers not to take webberexpats views as the final word on \( as im sure webberexpat him or herself would be the first to agree \) i dont deny that its a very strange piece of work , and as such , will not be to everyones taste but for those to whom it speaks , it is an extremely powerful reading experience happily , webberexpat was indeed the first to agree , writing i couldnt agree more , despite having absolutely hated valis anything by dick merits a close read i just found both archer and valis terribly sarcastic and tired of life and dismissive unpleasant , you get the idea that the dick who wrote these books was exceptionally unpleasant completely different than the tone of anything else dick wrote , such as the divine invasion or scanner darkly , which dealt with similar themes but , that was just my gut reaction , dissenting interpretations are always welcome finally , another fine thread started by kemster , who asked have you ever been bowled over a by a single sentence \? this one , from one hundred years of solitude , knocked me out they went ahead like sleepwalkers in a universe of grief first to reply was kmir with whatever remains green is more deeply , richly green than it was before john betjeman things took a slightly different course when judgedamnationagain suggested i remember years ago reading the jester by james patterson , and a couple of baddies are ransacking a church or something , and one of them says lets go search the fucking crypt that kind of knocked me sideways , but probably for different reasons than what youre thinking of then roadwaterlady gave us this from the broken shore by peter temple i suppose i can find a gassed tomato , some rat trap cheese and a couple of slices of tissue paper white she added just about sums up how i think of a cheese sandwich ugh poor roadwaterlady i weep for anyone who hasnt known the joy of a decent cheese sandwich put some quality cheddar , crisps and chutney in your next one interesting links about books and readinguh oh ! if donald trump doesnt succeed in destroying the free world , he may still have a future in

a former top drug enforcement administration \( dea \) official has accused congress of putting pharmaceutical company profits ahead of public health in the battle to combat the uss prescription opioid epidemic joseph rannazzisi , head of the dea office responsible for preventing prescription medicine abuse until last year , said drug companies and their lobbyists have a stranglehold on congress to protect a 9bn a year trade in opioid painkillers claiming the lives of nearly 19 , 000 people a year dea reduces opioid production in us amid painkiller addiction epidemic read morerannazzisi , director of the agencys office of diversion control for a decade , said the drug industry engineered recent legislation limiting the deas powers to act against pharmacies endangering lives by dispensing disproportionately large numbers of opioids he also accused lobbyists , who have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to influence opioid legislation and policy , of whipping up opposition to new guidelines for doctors intended to reduce the prescribing of the painkillers with a close resemblance to heroin congress would rather listen to people who had a profit motive rather than a public health and safety motive , said rannazzisi as long as the industry has this stranglehold through lobbyists , nothings going to change the former dea official , who is a pharmacist , was particularly scathing about politicians he said claim to be at the forefront of fighting the opioid epidemic while doing the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry in congress these congressmen and senators who are using this because they are up for re election , its a sham the congressmen and senators who are championing this fight , the ones who really believe in what theyre doing , their voices are drowned out because the industry has too much influence , he said charges that congress is too beholden to pharmaceutical companies have been levelled for years , particularly over controversial legislation such as the law that barred the government from negotiating lower prices for drugs bought for the medicare and medicaid systems but rannazzisi says the influence on opioid policies is particularly disturbing because so many lives are being lost and he sees members of congress claiming to take the issue seriously during election campaigns but acting differently in washington thats a criticism echoed by democrats in the senate , who issued a report earlier this month criticising republicans for passing sweeping legislation in july to combat addiction , the comprehensive addiction and recovery act \( cara \) , but refusing to fund it the report , dying waiting for treatment , likened the republican response to the opioid crisis to using a piece of chewing gum to patch a cracked dam the bill was comprehensive in name only without funding , its policies are little more than empty promises , the report said senator ron wyden of oregon , who released the report , acknowledged the influence of drug companies and their lobbyists on congress but he has also been critical of their sway over federal institutions there is no question that the powerful opioid manufacturers have a disproportionate voice , a disproportionate amount of influence , in these debates , he said rannazzisi clashed with congress over a law passed in april reducing the deas power to suspend the licenses of distributors and pharmacists accused of dispensing excessive amounts of opioids without abiding by regulations the ensuring patient access and effective drug enforcement act was initiated by an industry funded group , the healthcare distribution management association , which claimed that the dea was misusing its powers to go after pharmacists and drug distributors which made minor mistakes in their paperwork rannazzisi said the agency only targeted those that were sending millions of drugs down the street several states have sued pharmaceutical distributors , including west virginia , which accused a dozen companies of dumping 200m opioid pills on the state knowing many were dispensed to addicts able to get prescriptions from crooked doctors and pharmacists the new law requires the dea to warn pharmacies and distributors if they are in breach of regulations and to give them a chance to comply before licenses are withdrawn rannazzisi said that amounts to a free pass for institutional drug traffickers this doesnt ensure patient access and it doesnt help drug enforcement at all what this bill does has nothing to do with the medical process what this bill does is take away deas ability to go after a pharmacist , a wholesaler , manufacturer or distributor , he said this was a gift a gift to the industry rannazzisi riled some members of congress by telling them they were supporting criminals with the law representative tom marino of pennsylvania said he was immensely offended by the comment and told the dea to seek collaboration with legitimate companies that want to do the right thing corporations have no conscience , rannazzisi told the guardian unfortunately , with my job , i was the guy who had to go out and talk to families that lost kids if one of those ceos went out there and talked to anybody , or if one of those ceos happened to lose a kid to this horrible , horrible domestic tragedy we have , id bet you theyd change their mind when you sit with a parent who cant understand why theres so many pharmaceuticals out in the illicit marketplace , and why isnt the government doing anything , well the dea was doing something unfortunately what were trying to do is thwarted by people who are writing laws asked why he thinks the bill passed over the objections of the dea , rannazzisi gave a short derisive snort the bill passed because big pharma wanted it to pass the dea is both an enforcement agency and a regulatory agency when i was in charge what i tried to do was explain to my investigators and my agents that our job was to regulate the industry and theyre not going to like being regulated , he said industry groups have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in lobbying to stave off measures to reduce prescriptions and therefore sales of opioid painkillers among the most influential drug industry groups is the pain care forum , co founded by a top executive of purdue pharma the manufacturer of the opioid which unleashed the addiction epidemic , oxycontin and largely funded by pharmaceutical companies it spent 740m lobbying congress and state legislatures over the past decade according to the center for public integrity recipients of political donations from the industry included senator orrin hatch , chairman of the finance committee , who took 360 , 000 and representative mike rogers , who received more than 300 , 000 , according to the cpi the two politicians were instrumental in legislation establishing a panel to examine treatment of pain that critics said had close ties to industry funded groups wyden has been critical of what he says is pharmaceutical company influence over policy through other expert panels , including the government run interagency pain research coordinating committee \( iprcc \) the senator said it had been used to weaken guidelines drawn up by the centers for disease control and prevention \( cdc \) that discouraged doctors from prescribing opioids so widely earlier this year , wyden wrote to the secretary of health and human services , sylvia burwell , protesting about the presence on the iprcc of experts and activists he said had close links to pharmaceutical companies , including a scientist who holds a chair funded by a 1 5m endowment from purdue opioid painkiller study 66 of patients keep leftover pills after treatment read moreyouve got a panel thats certainly got a fair number of people that have a vested interest in this problem of overprescribing thats something youve got to root out , said wyden the role of the pharmaceutical companies on these advisory panels troubles me greatly science is getting short shrift compared to the political clout of these influential interests wyden criticised the presence of others on the iprcc including penney cowan , founder of the american chronic pain association , which he said receives corporate support from 11 companies that manufactured opioid based drugs and cindy steinberg , national policy director of the us pain foundation which he said receives substantial funding from opioid manufacturers cowan , who founded her association 36 years ago before prescription opioids were widely available , said the organisation is focused on education and relies on funding from drug companies because it is not available from other sources unfortunately no one cares about pain so they dont fund it , she said pharmaceutical companies dont have any influence over us i dont know that we would have survived the last 36 years if they did steinberg , who has lived with chronic pain for 15 years after she was crushed under a filing cabinet , said the us pain foundation receives unrestricted educational grants from pharmaceutical companies and other foundations but these do not influence policy these companies have no input into the materials the foundation creates , she said steinberg said she was honoured to serve on the iprcc and that its criticisms of the cdc guidelines were legitimate these included the fact that the guidelines were based on weak or very weak scientific evidence , she said as a result of the iprcc comments , the guidelines were subsequently put out for public comment , went to a larger group for review and revised to some extent which was a good thing in december , a congressional committee piled pressure on the cdc by launching an investigation into how it drew up the guidelines other members of congress suggested it was the job of the food and drug administration \( fda \) , which is more sympathetic to the position of the pharmaceutical companies , not the cdc to advise doctors on prescriptions in the end the committee turned up no evidence of wrongdoing but the pressure led to changes to the cdc guidelines and a delay in their release that rannazzisi said weakened their impact the industry got congress to put pressure on the cdc over their prescribing guidelines that was just a farce , he said dr andrew kolodny , director of physicians for responsible opioid prescribing , said resistance to the cdc guidelines is part of a pattern of opposition to measures that reduce sales of opioid pills the opioid lobby has very actively blocked interventions that might result in more cautious prescribing or reduced prescribing theyve very clearly defended their financial

the emails currently roiling the us presidential campaign are part of some unknown digital collection amassed by the troublesome anthony weiner , but if your purpose is to understand the clique of people who dominate washington today , the emails that really matter are the ones being slowly released by wikileaks from the hacked account of hillary clintons campaign chair john podesta they are last weeks scandal in a year running over with scandals , but in truth their significance goes far beyond mere scandal they are a window into the soul of the democratic party and into the dreams and thoughts of the class to whom the party answers the class to which i refer is not rising in angry protest they are by and large pretty satisfied , pretty contented nobody takes road trips to exotic west virginia to see what the members of this class looks like or how they live on the contrary , they are the ones for whom such stories are written this bunch doesnt have to make do with a comb over tv mountebank for a leader for this class , the choices are always pretty good , and this year they happen to be excellent they are the comfortable and well educated mainstay of our modern democratic party they are also the grandees of our national media the architects of our software the designers of our streets the high officials of our banking system the authors of just about every plan to fix social security or fine tune the middle east with precision droning they are , they think , not a class at all but rather the enlightened ones , the people who must be answered to but who need never explain themselves facebook twitter pinterest we learned to fight back dreamers campaign against donald trumplet us turn the magnifying glass on them for a change , by sorting through the hacked personal emails of john podesta , who has been a washington power broker for decades i admit that i feel uncomfortable digging through this hoard stealing someones email is a crime , after all , and it is outrageous that peoples personal information has been exposed , since wikileaks doesnt seem to have redacted the emails in any way there is also the issue of authenticity to contend with we dont know absolutely and for sure that these emails were not tampered with by whoever stole them from john podesta the supposed authors of the messages are refusing to confirm or deny their authenticity , and though they seem to be real , there is a small possibility they arent with all that taken into consideration , i think the wikileaks releases furnish us with an opportunity to observe the upper reaches of the american status hierarchy in all its righteousness and majesty the dramatis personae of the liberal class are all present in this amazing body of work financial innovators high achieving colleagues attempting to get jobs for their high achieving children foundation executives doing fine and noble things prizes , of course , and high academic achievement certain industries loom large and virtuous here hillarys ingratiating speeches to wall street are well known of course , but what is remarkable is that , in the party of jackson and bryan and roosevelt , smiling financiers now seem to stand on every corner , constantly proffering advice about this and that in one now famous email chain , for example , the reader can watch current us trade representative michael froman , writing from a citibank email address in 2008 , appear to name president obamas cabinet even before the great hope and change election was decided \( incidentally , an important clue to understanding why that greatest of zombie banks was never put out of its misery \) the far sighted innovators of silicon valley are also here in force , interacting all the time with the leaders of the party of the people we watch as podesta appears to email sheryl sandberg he makes plans to visit mark zuckerberg \( who , according to one missive , wants to learn more about next steps for his philanthropy and social action \) podesta exchanges emails with an entrepreneur about an ugly race now unfolding for silicon valleys seat in congress this man , in turn , appears to forward to podesta the remarks of yet another silicon valley grandee , who complains that one of the democratic combatants in that fight was criticizing billionaires who give to democrats specifically , the miscreant dem in question was said to be spinning \( and attacking \) donors who have supported democrats john arnold and marc leder have both given to cory booker , joe kennedy , and others he is also attacking every billionaire that donates to congressional candidate ro khanna , many whom support other democrats as well attacking billionaires !

three days ago , james comey was one of donald trumps symbols of washington corruption and a law enforcer of the highest integrity to hillary clintons campaign on sunday , the fbi director was the most controversial figure in the capital , heroic to trump , irresponsible to clinton and puzzling to nearly everyone comey has a long history of trying to walk political tightropes , to varying success , dating to the earliest days of his career clinton and trump camps duel over fbi director 's late email revelation read morecomey , a career prosecutor who grew up in new jersey and studied religion and chemistry , had his first brush with a high profile investigation came in 1996 , after a stint with the us attorney for new york that year , he joined a senate investigation into bill and hillary clintons real estate investments , named whitewater after a failed venture they joined he remained in the background of an investigation that ultimately petered out , but comey soon joined two prestigious prosecutors offices , in eastern virginia and manhattan , where he pursued high profile cases against identity thieves , a top credit suisse banker and martha stewart in 2003 , he was named deputy attorney general in the administration of george w bush , becoming a dissenting voice against surveillance programs of the national security agency revealed in 2005 by the new york times comey later testified to congress that one night in march 2004 , with attorney general john ashcroft hospitalized for an emergency procedure , he raced to the sickbed to prevent the renewal of warrantless wiretapping programs which the justice department had determined were illegal comey arrived just before bushs top lawyer and chief of staff , and ashcroft did not sign the renewal i was angry , comey told the senate in 2007 i thought i just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man , who did not have the powers of the attorney general because they had been transferred to me that night was probably the most difficult night of my professional life the next day , bush modified the wiretapping program in those hearings , about possible misconduct by the white house chief counsel and , ironically , missing emails from the republican national committee , comey told congress he felt it imperative that the justice department stand outside partisan politics the department of justice , in my view , is run by political appointees of the president , he testified but once they take those jobs and run this institution , its very important in my view for that institution to be an other in american life my people had to stand up before juries of all stripes , talk to sheriffs of all stripes , judges of all stripes they had to be seen as the good guys , and not as either this administration or that administration comey left the justice department in 2005 for lockheed martin , the largest military contractor in the us , and eventually an investment firm and columbia law school in 2013 , barack obama nominated the registered republican to lead the fbi , joking that the 6ft 8in prosecutor was a man who stands very tall for justice and the rule of law he was confirmed as the agencys seventh director in a 93 1 vote only kentucky senator rand paul voted against him , over domestic drone surveillance and quickly took on a series of controversial cases will hillary clinton lose the election because of the fbi 's email investigation \? read morethough he opposed the nsas warrantless wiretapping , comey has emerged as a steady advocate of us security agencies since the guardian revealed a host of programs in 2013 , a system that gave the fbi access to a trove of data comey has repeatedly argued that security agencies should be given tools to bypass private encryption , and took the fbi to court against apple over unlocking the phone of one of the san bernardino terrorists were asking apple to take the vicious guard dog away and let us pick the lock , he told congress in march its not their job to watch out for public safety thats our job the logic of encryption will bring us to a place in the not too distant future where all of our conversations and all our papers and effects are entirely private the legal battle ended in anticlimax , as the fbi found another way into the iphone it has since said that the hack it used does not work on newer phone models comey has walked a careful line on race and police killings last year he said it was unacceptable that the guardian and washington post had better data on police shootings than the federal government , but also dipped into controversy by suggesting a ferguson effect named after sometimes violent protests in ferguson , missouri , over the police shooting of an unarmed black teen may cause police officers to step back from their responsibilities comey conceded he lacked evidence for that claim , which led him into an unusually public disagreement with the president , who warned last year what we cant do is cherry pick data or use anecdotal evidence to drive policy or to feed political agendas since then , tentative research by the justice department and a st louis criminologist has suggested the ferguson effect is plausible as an explanation for a single year spike in violent crime the director rose to national prominence in july , when he announced the fbis findings in its investigation into whether clinton and her staff had acted criminally in their use of a private email server he concluded there was no evidence of intentional wrongdoing comey used a press conference itself a break from tradition and his original sin , in one former officials words to lay out the facts at the time , correct several false claims by clinton , and castigate her and her staff for their extremely careless email practices he was then called to congress to defend his decision , which ended months of expensive and inconclusive republican investigations facebook twitter pinterest clinton email investigation five key revelations from the fbiyou know what would be a double standard \? if she were prosecuted for gross negligence , comey told the house no reasonable prosecutor would bring the second case in 100 years based on gross negligence its not fair to prosecute someone on these facts , he insisted , calling the procedure celebrity hunting and adding one of the things i have learned in this case is that the secretary may not have been as sophisticated as people would assume asked about his voter registration , comey said he no longer belonged to any party kellyanne conway trump fan chanting jew s a behaved in deplorable way read morethe short letter comey wrote to congressional leaders on friday admits that he does not know whether new emails found on a computer belonging to the estranged husband of a clinton staffer have any significance that lack of information has turned attention to the director himself , who reportedly broke with not only precedent but advice from top justice department officials by going public an internal memo comey sent to staff , leaked to several news organizations , suggests the director felt he had no choice but to act , given his testimony to congress i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record , he wrote at the same time , however , given that we dont know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails , i dont want to create a misleading impression in trying to strike that balance , in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season , there is significant risk of being misunderstood , but i wanted you to hear directly from me about it topicsjames comeyfbihillary clintonus elections 2016us politicsus justice systemnewsshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
the latest furore over hillary clintons alleged misuse of private emails when she was secretary of state in 2009 2013 has thrown a tumultuous and unedifying us presidential election into even greater confusion , with little more than a week to go before voting day the fbis unexpected and very public revelation that it is recommencing its investigation into clintons conduct may not be politically motivated , but its timing certainly makes it appear that way the row represents yet another hammer blow to a democratic process whose credibility has been repeatedly challenged , principally by the unscrupulous republican candidate , donald trump despite this new firestorm , stoked by republicans and rightwing media , it remains likely that american voters will deliver a clear , possibly resounding , rejection of trump on 8 november although opinion polls show the race tightening nationally and nothing is certain as a febrile campaign climaxes , clinton is ahead almost everywhere that matters and she is the sane and reasonable , if uninspiring , choice a trump defeat will be richly deserved as we have noted previously , he is not a fit and proper person to serve in the white house his behaviour during a long , raucous and often embarrassingly vulgar campaign made that abundantly plain yet consigning the donald to the rubbish bin of electoral history is easier than getting rid of trumpism this is likely to take a lot longer trumps platform was based not on thought through policies and careful analysis but on prejudice , grievance , ignorance and fear , spiced with opportunism his unexpected success in winning the nomination , despite the republican establishments hostility , reflected his close identification with mainly white , working class and lower middle class voters who , like him , feel angry , undervalued and alienated while public figures such as barack obama , trumps failed republican rival jeb bush and clinton appear to this constituency to be remote , out of touch and uncaring , trumpism peddles the delusion that the candidate is on their side again and again , in ohio , florida and elsewhere , disaffected voters claimed that only trump could be trusted to tell the truth , only trump would keep his promises , only trump could make america great again oblivious to paradox , irony , history or facts , trumpism projects a distorted vision of american greatness the trump doctrine decrees that a nation built by immigrants , that became the most powerful on earth is so scared of migrant and refugee hordes that it must build a 2 , 000 mile wall with mexico trumpism holds that a great nation that incorporated religious tolerance into its groundbreaking constitution and bill of rights must now shatter its own principles and deliberately discriminate against muslims to keep itself safe as general concepts , trumpism makes an enemy of the other , equates nationality with homogeneity , calls honest critics liars and seeks to threaten , jail or harm opponents it says individualism outweighs state authority , as in the unfettered right to bear firearms , but not , perversely , in the case of a womans right to choose abortion trumpism distrusts and fears foreigners it believes free trade , international treaties and economic globalisation in general are loaded dice intended to rip off americans paranoid trumpism holds that long term allies such as germany and japan get a free security ride at americas expense trumpism admires the domestic authoritarianism and international bullying of dictatorships in russia and china vladimir putin is a strong leader standing up for his people , national beliefs and way of life any inconvenient truth that contradicts this or other trumpist narratives is inherently mendacious , part of a web of lies and falsehoods spun by the treacherous mass media conspiring with the establishment to dupe honest citizens and dont forget trumpism cannot be fairly defeated if it loses , it was cheated for sure trumpism appeals to the worst in people , cynically exploiting and fanning the anger , grievances and prejudices of the economically disadvantaged , the embittered , uneducated and plain ignorant it appeals to base instincts , to lowest common denominators its is political dumbing down writ large it is underpinned by a pervasive and comprehensible insecurity , engendered across the west by post 2008 economic injustice and social division , the growing gulf between rich and poor and incompetent , unfeeling or corrupt governance fear is the common enemy , but fear is trumpisms friend this phenomenon is not confined to america european countries , including britain , experience variations on the theme in germany and france , concern about rising immigration has boosted hardline nationalists whose appeal and disturbing ideology extend far beyond the cathartic issue of syria in greece , poland , austria and hungary , rightwing extremists evil , dehumanising ideas about refugees , migrants and foreigners in general have become a commonplace of political discussion in britain , ukip , provides a noisy echo chamber for some of trumpisms most divisive , chauvinistic and discriminatory refrains if trumpism is indeed a transnational pestilence , it would be wise to look for a common remedy but first , the symptoms must be accurately diagnosed and its long term effects should not be exaggerated much of the political turbulence and iconoclasm witnessed of late in america and europe is the direct result of continuing , negative economic fallout from the 2008 financial crash hard times , austerity cuts , high unemployment and low wages are the manure in which political aberration takes root but as history shows , they sometimes , yet rarely , lead to disaster when economies improve , generally speaking , so too does the quality of political discourse ensuring all people benefit equally from such an improvement is the one certain antidote to extreme politics while protest movements share characteristics and aims , it is also evident that they are not all the same as each other trumpism is an infection others can catch , yet it is also unique to america before panicking about the advance of the far right and far left in europe , commentators in britain and elsewhere should remember that , when all is said and done , mainstream politicians such as angela merkel , alain jupp , mariano rajoy and yes , hillary clinton do , on the whole , get elected or re elected notwithstanding greeces epic upheavals , the centre does mostly hold more than anything else , trumpism will fade and fail because , ultimately , it is a minority pastime , pandering to bigotry , which runs against the grain and spirit of the times , brexit notwithstanding trumpism decries the impact of globalisation , yet globalisation , for all the dislocation and often unwelcome change it brings , is the inescapable way ahead for a more integrated , more connected and more mutually responsible and caring world for good or bad , this clock cannot be turned back closed borders and closed minds , crude nationalism , trade barriers , xenophobia , religious , racial and sexual discrimination these are old mistakes and old hatreds that , while still in evidence everywhere , belong to times past the world is moving forward , not back in the end , trumpism and all its ghastly incarnations , dwelling in fear and darkness , will , like trump himself , be exorcised topicsdonald trumpopinionus elections 2016hillary clintonus

by declining to put up an official candidate to fight the richmond park byelection , the conservative party has shown itself to be cynical , cowardly and rational it took the decision knowing that it is not a great look for the governing party to absent itself from the contest it calculated that it would be an even more dreadful look to field someone in the colours of mrs may and see them slaughtered which is what would have happened the chances of an official tory candidate winning in this leafy patch of southwest london would have been somewhat lower than a flying saucer piloted by elvis and lord lucan landing on the head of the loch ness monster there is no constituency in the country with a more intense concentration of rage about heathrow expansion and the government has just declared that it wants to multiply the number of planes flying over its rooftops the constituency voted heavily to remain within the european union and the government is embarked on a trajectory towards one of the harder versions of brexit a candidate in the name of the tory party would have split the conservative vote , enhancing the chances of the lib dems taking the seat so cowardice and cynicism combined with logic yet this does not mean that the absence of an official competitor for the tory party is an unalloyed blessing for zac goldsmith , the former conservative mp who is recontesting the seat in the guise of an independent once upon a time , when he had a reputation as someone who was not enslaved to his partys line , he might have been convincing in that role not now only a few months ago , he was the conservative candidate for mayor of london moreover , he made the disastrous decision not to run on his own terms , but to be the frontman for a racially charged campaign designed by the tory machine both nasty and ineffective , even his sister , jemima khan , was moved to publicly deplore that campaign only very occasionally in british politics have we seen genuine independents in parliament one such was martin bell , the former bbc correspondent famed for his white suit , who ran and won as the anti sleaze candidate against neil hamilton in tatton at the 1997 election zac goldsmith is no martin bell to see how truly independent he is , we only have to visit the website of the local tory party when i checked there on saturday , the banner at the top of the home page still featured his mugshot alongside the tory logo the strapline read supporting zac goldsmith in the richmond park constituency the video content is a stream of images of the man who is supposedly no longer a member of their party a statement by the chairman says that the association and its resources will not play a part in this byelection , before declaring that individuals who are members of the association may well wish to support zacs campaign and they are at liberty to do so it then provides an email address for joining his campaign statements from the tory party nationally have conveyed their warmest wishes for his re election should he be returned as an mp , it is widely suspected , and he has not denied it , that he will only sit as an independent for a while before , after an interval he judges to be decent , rejoining the tory party if words in politics retain any meaning , zac goldsmith is no independent if he is re elected , it will be a message to mrs may to carry on as you are it is a big challenge to run as a genuine independent because they cant usually compete with the money , logistical capacity and activist base at the disposal of organised parties i guess the money is no obstacle in this case the trustafarian mr goldsmith has exceedingly deep pockets there is an issue over how much support overt or clandestine he is going to get from the conservative party will the tory machine feed him with voter data \? this is a highly valuable commodity , especially at a byelection when turnout is often pivotal to the outcome it seems to be a legal grey area whether the tory party can gift him resources without it counting against the byelection spending limit or whether he should be expected to pay a commercial rate and count that as a campaign expense he starts with some significant advantages he has a well known name , enjoys the benefits of incumbency and won a chunky majority of more than 20 , 000 in 2015 the first opinion poll for what its worth has him comfortably ahead in an age that expects politicians to betray their pledges when they become inconvenient , he may earn credit with some voters for keeping his promise to resign and recontest the seat if his party went ahead with heathrow expansion here , though , is a paradox this byelection may have been triggered by the runway decision , but it is essentially irrelevant to the contest his lib dem rivals are just as opposed to the expansion of heathrow and , unlike mr goldsmiths party , they have always been united in their conviction that it is a terrible idea the lib dems , who came second in the seat in 2015 and held it until 2010 , ache for the boost in media attention and party morale that they would receive from a victory vince cable suggested that he might be up for attempting a comeback there , but in the end he did not apply to be the candidate it concerns some lib dems that their flagbearer , sarah olney , lacks the name recognition and the experience of her opponent , but that has not prevented them from pulling off byelection sensations before tim farrons party seeks to cast the contest as a referendum on the tory government and particularly its trajectory towards a hard brexit this makes sense if they are to see a national revival from their near death experience at the last general election , a good hunting ground for the lib dems is among remain voters alienated from both a brexiteering tory government and corbyn labour on europe , labour is split and scared about how to deal with the division between its london stronghold , which voted heavily for in , and its midland , northern and welsh heartlands , where there was hefty support for out that prevents labour from being a clear voice for the 48 the lib dems dont have that difficulty they can be unequivocal opponents of hard brexit they believe that helped them to do well at the recent witney byelection where they leapfrogged from fourth place to second , with a swing of 19 the swing to them from the tories would only have to be a smidge higher for the lib dems to take richmond park mr goldsmith is at odds with most of his constituents , who voted by more than two to one to remain within the european union it is probably not to his advantage that he is so to the liking of nigel farage that ukip has stood aside from the contest and endorsed him in such an anti brexit constituency , it is of dubious benefit to be the lightly camouflaged candidate of the tory party and the explicit candidate of ukip some hoped that richmond park might be a testing ground for the idea of a progressive alliance between parties on the other side of the spectrum three relatively senior labour figures , clive lewis , lisa nandy and jonathan reynolds , last week jointly suggested that their party should stand aside to maximise the chances of a lib dem victory , on the grounds that in this parliament progressives will need every vote that they can get this was an interesting intervention and the more so because the trio hail from different wings of the party their initiative might even deserve to be called quite brave , for committing the heresy against tribal gods of suggesting that sometimes people should support a party other than their first choice the idea has got nowhere because it received a predictably icy response from the party leadership jeremy corbyn and his deputy , tom watson , dont agree on much on opposing this idea they are as one caroline lucas , the greens only mp , is one of the more eloquent advocates of deeper co operation between non tory parties she visited the richmond greens to see if they might be persuaded to stand aside and found them unwilling she concluded the old politics dies hard sure does this

take back control , cried the brexit campaigners , from the dark forces of the eu and open britain up to a glorious future in which it can embrace the world it was a seductive cry , but was a lie from top to bottom the eu did not stop britains embrace of the world instead , it was and is a crucial bridge to it while brexit campaigners rhetoric may be of global openness , their actions betoken retreat it is not from the left that we have to fear an orwellian dystopia in which words are manipulated , never to mean what they purport to mean , but from rightwing leavers this is nowhere clearer than in the intense threat now facing british universities , one of the uks great national and international assets universities , dedicated to learning , teaching and research , are indispensable building blocks of any civilisation but they are also increasingly important economic institutions a university in a 21st century british city plays a similar role to a cathedral in a medieval city as a magnet of economic and cultural activity universities are a source of employment , collaborators with companies and public agencies , and , by attracting so many young people , a mainspring of vitality and rich urban life \( full declaration i am principal of hertford college , oxford university \) for brexiters and ukippers , however , universities have a dark side they involve themselves with dread word foreigners universities , in the rights universe , are anti british fifth columnists they will insist on welcoming students and researchers from the eu and the rest of the world , in part because they believe in the intellectual vitality that comes with having diverse student and research communities and in part because they need the cash university tuition fees in 2013 14 totalled 13 7bn because foreign students pay fees two or three times higher than the 9 , 000 maximum set for english students , overseas students contribute more than a third of that total on top , they spend on accommodation , leisure and sustenance in every university town in britain , they are a brilliant economic , social and cultural asset , indispensable to the viability and vitality of the university , while boosting local economies britain has been good at attracting international students because we have two priceless advantages we have great universities and we teach courses and award degrees in our native tongue english which is now the lingua franca tens of thousands of chinese students come to britain every year not to settle here and steal british jobs , but because they want to learn to speak english and obtain the vital credential of a degree won in england and then go home however , the home office insists on counting foreign students as immigrants part of the wide perception that immigration is out of control , from which nigel farage built his anti eu case , is because of this statistical quirk thus , last year net migration totalled 336 , 000 but 169 , 000 of those were students \( netting out incoming students from british students leaving to study abroad \) exclude them and suddenly the net migration total looks back in control 167 , 000 toughen up the permit regime for non eu migrants and david cameron could have hit his target of net migration in the tens of thousands and farage and co would have lost a crucial platform in their anti eu hyperbole home office resistance to this statistical redefinition , led by theresa may as home secretary and continuing now as prime minister , is because some students do stay in britain after winning their degrees on this view , higher education has become a backdoor means of avoiding immigration controls too few incoming students seem to be leaving , although nobody can know for certain whether this is true eu students have the right to stay but they only constitute a quarter of all foreign students because britain invests scant resources in policing its student visa regime , the only evidence on students leaving is the hit and miss system of sampling travellers at british ports and airports of course there has been cheating and some bogus degree courses , but not an industrial scale and now largely closed down i find it hard to believe that there is an army of up to half a million asian ex students in their mid to late 20s whose student visas have expired now working in britains black economy but on that supposition the prime minister and home office refuse to budge students must count as immigrants and vital ammunition is given to xenophobes and eurosceptics the chancellor , philip hammond , is concerned that for these dubious reasons universities are going to be required to cut their international student numbers dramatically with severe consequences for their viability , foreign exchange earnings and britains reputation for openness he observed mildly 10 days ago that it would be good to test public opinion to see if public objections to foreign students were so ferocious as to justify the policy of counting them as immigrants number 10 slapped him down the foreign secretary , boris johnson , who , as london mayor , spoke out strongly in favour of international students , has gone mute as foreign secretary he proclaims openness to the globe rather than europe , but it is a conviction that does not involve risking his career and new reputation as europhobe in chief what he does is to enable closure britain cannot escape its history , its language or the opportunities and challenges afforded by globalisation in our globalising times , china sends approximately 90 , 000 students a year to britain , india 18 , 500 , malaysia 17 , 000 , hong kong 16 , 000 and singapore , thailand and pakistan some 7 , 000 each we should be proud that such numbers of students from these seven countries alone want to study here australia , canada and the us will jump at the chance to host them as we turn them away , terrified they are all wannabe immigrants really \? it is a savage indictment of our new public culture i have lost count of the number of international students worried if they are wanted , whether they should apply for graduate studies and scared of the way the atmosphere around them is becoming more hostile not one single leave minister in the government speaks out for them , their cause or the international role of our universities despite their protestations of embracing the globe that falls to remainers such as hammond or the universities minister , jo johnson the leavers are charlatans i , for one , want my

i had been showing my sons japanese in laws around highgate cemetery , telling them what a doughty collection of fascinating minds and souls had the pleasure of each others company here yet afterwards i was struck with unexpected melancholy , as it hit me what a lonely thing it is to live out eternity far from the human interactions most of us have with family and friends while we are alive , and that lying in a chill grave alongside the commonest of beings or the greatest intellects was no consolation what i would like , i announced to my son and daughter in law , is to have my ashes kept in some container nothing flash , a box will do in the home we share and which my son intends to keep i could be an ethereal presence among the family , listening in to the quotidian chatter and arguments , privy to all that the keepers of the family dna say and do at which my daughter in law gave me a beautiful smile and said that was fine with her in japan , they keep the ashes of their loved ones in a shrine at home so that relatives can hold loving rituals , have a chat or even seek comfort from remembered wisdom of their elders , and she would happily do the same for me my son nodded if its what you want , thats what well do the effect of being told that i can go on being with my family has given me a startling amount of comfort and made me feel infinitely less fearful of being dead than i had when i envisaged being tucked away in some burial ground of course , it is not what everyone would want , but several people i have told about it have said that they , too , would like to be a part of the lives of their nearest and dearest and perhaps that we could design our containersso i was mightily upset at the pope \( and thus far ive had a soft spot for him \) saying that people should not keep the ashes of their dead at home , nor , i suppose , at the sacred stones burial mound in cambridgeshire , which opened last week and is described as a sacred space in a secular world by one person wanting to buy a niche presumably , if we are not buried in a sacred place , we sacrifice gods protection but like an increasing number of people , i do not have a faith led by a god holding out the possibility of eternal caring surveillance , nor belief in a higher force that will whisk me off to elysian delights after my corporeal exit from the world so far as i am concerned , death means death and , with it , nothingness and herein lies the crisis of our time , as a huge swath of us edges ever closer to the inevitability of a death that offers no comforting afterlife we are terrified at the idea of that finality , of losing control over our lives and place in this world in our culture where the defining mantras are self help , self improvement and demonstrating that you can defeat natures pattern of diminishing us as we age , death is the greatest insult and how often you hear of people angry until the end so it is certainly worth raging against ageism and the grim prejudices in our society that mean we torment body and soul in our efforts to deny the ageing process but to be raging against the dying of the light , if it means we are in a state of rage at what we cannot prevent and because what comes afterwards seems so devoid of comfort , is a pitiful way to go yet there are real signs of a healthy shift , if not a groundswell , with people writing interestingly and intensely subjectively about death as fact or fiction tv programmes , still admittedly hooked into reality lifestyle , run programmes on the types of funeral to be had so that we can be involved in designing the way we will be seen off the death cafe movement , developed by jon underwood and sue barsky reid , began in 2011 and has held cafes in england and 37 other countries its objective is to increase awareness of death with a view to helping people make the most of their \( finite \) lives , with no defined objectives or themes , just group directed discussion over tea and cake the most eloquent and compelling argument for making death a subject we can discuss without embarrassment or discomfort with family , friends , children , doctors , carers is made by atul gawande in his book he explores humane , client centred models of residential care , ways of involving our elderly in society in a fulfilling lifestyle until the end the health and spiritual benefits that living as extended family may bring gawande has seen how terminal patients choosing quality of life over quantity choosing not to have more invasive treatments despite this meaning less time to live can be surprisingly happy as a surgeon and public health researcher , he knows that mortality can be a treacherous subject for many , such talk , no matter how carefully framed , raises the spectre of a society readying itself to sacrifice its sick and aged but what if the sick and aged are already being sacrificed victims of our refusal to accept the inexorability of our life cycle \? accept it we will be forced to do , so surely the very best we can do is get talking and make clear how we want our end to be whether it is , as in the netherlands , the possibility of calling in the doctor when life has become unbearable suffering to being cared for , whatever the risks , in our own home to gorge ourselves on hand rolled chocolates and a litre of remy martin if we wish to have the comfort of a pet for someone alone or to choose the famous kindness of hospice care , so that we may cast off this mortal coil in the best way possible if our final wish to end up at home on the mantelpiece is granted , ill thank the pope to keep his disapproval to himself topicsdeath and dyingopinionpope francisreligioncommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content
when the snp finally wakes up and realises that it had better fire the starting gun soon on the second independence referendum , it will be faced immediately with some decisions that will have a significant bearing on the final outcome the first one will be to determine who decides what goes into the new white paper on independence this must be followed quickly by a decision on how significant a role the party itself will play during the campaign the snp , which has already been in power for nine years , is set fair for at least another decade this is why those who have spun their tales for it for a few years are highly prized by the corporate community not only have they gained experience in how decisions are taken but they can lead their new paymasters directly to the front doors of ministers , in the secure knowledge that the person sitting behind the desk will not belong to a different party in the last two years , several of the snps most able advisers and strategists have walked into highly paid jobs with companies keen to maintain some connection with the party if you want to see them in action , secure a small personal loan from the bank to pay the entrance fee to the snps next massive party convention in the hall set aside for the purposes of allowing corporations to sell you their products , you will soon see how busy is the bridge between the snps back office and the private sector its reasonable to conclude that by the time the snp finally leaves office , around 20 years will have elapsed a chap could grow accustomed to snapping his fingers and making things happen during a 20 year administration why would he want to jeopardise it by sailing in the choppy waters of the constitution \? in this place , danger lurks everywhere to lose two referendums in a row would lead to disillusionment among the 100 , 000 new members and a possible return to apathy or apathys little brother the labour party in scotland to actually win the next one is virtually to consign your party to the history books , with a note of thanks for helping us over the line who needs all that uncertainty when you can have a ball for a few more years , getting people to do as you ask and embellishing your cv \? im sure , though , that once it realises that , in an affluent country that isnt actually being physically occupied by a hostile foreign foe , enthusiasm for self determination is a fragile and capricious thing it wont last for ever this concerns those of us who would prefer that they get off their arses and grasp the moment at a time when the rest of the uk is turning in on itself and on the verge of committing the biggest act of economic self immolation in european political history what concerns some of us more is the prospect of the snp once more leading the independence movement from the front and brooking very little opposition over tactics and authorship of the second white paper the snp , you see , is fast becoming the yes movements weakest link its mismanagement of the nhs has been evident for many years , as is its excuse that scotland has an ageing population well , theres one way of solving that get people to drink and smoke more and take bobbies off the street isnt having an ageing population a desired socioeconomic outcome \? but it is its spiteful little illiberal interventions that hint at something distasteful with the snp that , underneath all the lofty rhetoric about fairness and equality that lets it win elections and hang on to power , there is a reactionary core despite saying all the right things about the spread of betting shops in deprived areas , the party curiously backed away from giving local authorities powers to prevent the big betting companies buy up empty shops sure enough , there was a stall at the snp conference the other week where you could get a selfie with the scottish cup courtesy of the association of british bookmakers the partys backing of a third runway at heathrow was another puzzle why would a party with a commitment to making scotland the greenest wee country on the planet want to have anything remotely to do with a project that will pollute everything in its path and very likely be in breach of eu regulations on noise and air pollution \? if the snps fabled 56 \( ish \) at westminster are not too busy collecting rents on their second and third properties they will find that they will be required to ensure that theresa may gets her way on this meanwhile , the fight for justice for miners falsely convicted of wrongdoing by a politically motivated police force during the 1984 85 miners strike goes on many of these men were deliberately targeted on the orders of the tories because of trade union activity and subsequently blacklisted and unable to find work because of the stain of conviction again , curiously , the snp has refused to pardon these men or mount a public inquiry into the conduct of the police in the wake of the snps plans to pardon men convicted of same sex sexual offences under outdated legislation , the labour msp neil findlay has written to the justice secretary , michael matheson , requesting that wrongly convicted miners receive a similar act of compassion i wouldnt hold my breath , though if the labour party in scotland wasnt still starring in its own grim pantomime , it would be exposing the reactionary nature of the snp much more effectively than it does my fear is that the snps essential conservatism will be laid bare during a second referendum id like to see the snp take a back seat next time and then disappear when independence is gained and a government with an authentic commitment to social justice is installed topicsscottish national party \( snp \) opinionnicola sturgeonscottish independencesnp conference 2016scottish politicsscotlandcommentshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare on google share on whatsappshare on messengerreuse this content

hillary clinton called on the fbi to immediately explain its review of a new batch of emails the agency said appeared to be pertinent to the previous investigation into her use of a private server world series trumps presidential election in two title starved midwest cities read moreaddressing reporters on friday , the democratic presidential nominee said it was imperative for american voters to have all of the information with just 11 days remaining before the presidential election the american people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately , clinton said during a press conference in des moines , iowa its imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question , whatever it is , without further delay we are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes the fbi director , james comey , announced the discovery of the new emails in a letter to congress , which did not offer any specifics other than to disclose that federal investigators would review whether they contained classified information in connection with an unrelated case , the fbi has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation , comey wrote i agreed that the fbi should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information , as well as to assess their importance to our investigation in july , comey announced that the bureau had closed its investigation into clintons emails and recommended prosecutors not seek charges in the case but comey rebuked clinton and her aides for the extremely careless manner in which the emails were handled clinton told reporters that she and her team had been given no advance warning and learned of the email investigation through news reports when comeys letter was made public but seeking to mitigate the political ramifications of the announcement , which was immediately seized upon by her republican opponent , clinton urged the fbi to provide a clearer picture of its findings even director comey noted that this new information may not be significant , so lets get it out , clinton said , adding she had not been contacted by the fbi in relation to the matter even director comey noted that this new information may not be significant , so lets get it outhillary clintonfederal law enforcement officials said the emails were discovered on a laptop shared by anthony weiner and his estranged wife , huma abedin , a top aide to clinton weiner , a former congressman from new york , has been the subject of an unrelated investigation after it was revealed he sent illicit messages and photos to an underage girl clinton would not confirm the link to weiner and abedin , who remains with her on the campaign trail , stating weve heard these rumors we dont know what to believe thats why it is incumbent upon the fbi to tell us what theyre talking about right now your guess is as good as mine , and i dont think thats good enough weve made it very clear that if theyre going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to republican members of the house , that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the american people , she added , and thats what i expect to happen the letter was sent to both republican and democratic leaders of relevant committees in congress facebook twitter pinterest trump gleefully responds to new fbi probe into clinton emailsa letter sent by comey to his employees on friday , and reported by the washington post , provided a glimpse into his thinking the fbi director said he felt an obligation to inform congress of the new review , based on his prior testimony before federal lawmakers that the investigation into clintons emails was complete at the same time , however , given that we dont know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails , i dont want to create a misleading impression , comey wrote clinton has been dogged by questions over the use of her private email server since it was discovered weeks before she formally launched her presidential bid , and polling suggests the controversy has damaged her image among voters just 34 of americans find clinton honest and trustworthy , according to a recent washington post abc poll sensing an opportunity to revive the email controversy despite the fbis vaguely worded statement , the republican presidential nominee , donald trump said during a rally in new hampshire on friday hillary clintons corruption is on a scale we have never seen before we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office at a later rally in lisbon , maine , he called her use of private emails the biggest political scandal since watergate at a later rally in cedar rapids , iowa , he abandoned his weeks of accusing the fbi of collusion with the clinton campaign i give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong , he said justice will prevail i think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails and now they are choosing a presidenthillary clintonclinton , whose lead over trump has widened in recent weeks as the real estate moguls campaign unraveled in the wake of a tape in which he bragged about being able to grope women , said she believed the email issue was already factored into how the american public thinks i think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails , clinton said and now they are choosing a president the clinton campaign expressed its frustration with the fbis handling of the latest development , criticizing the way in which the news was disseminated after maintaining silence in order to allow for clinton to first address the matter , democrats quickly went on the offensive following her press conference with a series of statements calling on comey to come forward with more details the deliberately ambiguous nature of the directors most recent disclosure the emails could be significant or insignificant , relevant or irrelevant contributes nothing to the publics understanding , adam schiff , the top democrat on the house intelligence committee , said in a statement ca n't vote wo n't vote how turnout will decide the 2016 presidential election read morewhen coupled with the acknowledgment that more information will take an indeterminate period of time , it is difficult to see how this latest departure from department policy has served the public interest

im mid 40s and have stalled but how do i compete for jobs with younger people \? i am in my 40s and have worked all my life in several sectors but ive come to a standstill in my career where im working for the nhs as a doctors receptionist dragons , wannabe doctors , as everyone calls us this , of course , is not true , but why bother to explain , it will make no difference i want a change , but feel like im an old person in a new , just out of school and willing to learn make a difference world how do i prove that i can be the right person for the job with my expansive work history over all these teens \? jeremy saysdoctors receptionists form a human buffer zone between two groups of distracted people the doctors , doing their best to diagnose and treat multiple patients every day , usually in 10 minute segments , and trying and often failing to keep to an impossible timetable and their patients , often anxious parents , with health concerns that make them more than normally self centred i can sense from your letter that the daily experience of being held responsible for circumstances wholly outside of your control has taken its toll that is all too understandable , but you must try very hard not to let your sense of grievance show one of the most unattractive characteristics you can reveal in an interview is world weariness , bordering on bitterness and cynicism no one wants to import such an attitude into their workplace and it will count heavily against you sometimes its not a prejudice againstolder people , as such , that works against them in stark contrast with the bright eyed optimism of the young , its the way they can exude a sense of cynicism and hopelessness you want a change , but the chances are that your best bet of finding something satisfying to do will have some connection , even if slight , with some part of your previous expansive work history think systematically of all the jobs youve done , and all the different situations youve encountered , and pick a couple youd like to return to and then , just as systematically , list not what youd want from such positions but what you with all your experience could contribute to them thats what any application you make must positively project enthusiasm , real understanding of the specific task concerned , and with an emphasis on what you believe you could bring to it you cant prove that you would be the right person for a job , nobody can but you can , entirely legitimately , present yourself as a very attractive prospect readers say if being an administrator has been your primary experience over the past 20 years then there are a great many senior administrator positions that you could apply for , highlighting your extensive experience including customer facing work and the associated managing of unexpected events under pressure etc but you sound frustrated , so take some time to work on your mind set fatherlarryduff consider a larger employer , as you will have access to internal vacancies , secondment opportunities and staff development be proactive about your skills gaps and focus on redirecting your career with energy , determination and positivity therunninggirl i am 40 , and my closest colleague at work , on the same management level as i am , is 25 and has many skills i dont have and recognises that i have some skills he doesnt yet have either we learn from each other id say treat your colleagues with respect , do the job to the best of your ability , and show rather than tell those around you your abilities if you have talent and are assertive you should be able to shine , but dont belittle those who are different from you tacitanontacit wait until you reach your 50s stevenhope1964i want to help people and work in recruitment , but am always told that im too nicei have worked in the relentless business of employment advice so long that i have become disillusioned about what transferable skills i have ive dealt with customers who have been unemployed for decades , and helped those with severe disabilities or that are suicidal and in need of mental health assessments i first thought that i could go into recruitment , but after about six interviews i got told by every company that i am either not hungry enough or am too nice for recruitment my current job is not giving me the hours i would like and i am looking over my shoulder every day waiting for the boss to say , well this is your last day , they pulled the plug i have all the experience in the world but not one qualification to my name i have been promised qualifications left right and centre but when i have asked about them the answer is usually something about them trying to get the funding where else do i fit , what else can i do \? i love helping people but recruitment thinks im not evil enough jeremy saysa bit like the reader before , you show signs of allowing your disillusionment to colour your entire approach to finding agreeable work again , thats completely understandable but if it becomes apparent in your manner it can only harm your prospects i doubt if your lack of qualifications is holding you back in feedback , recruiters often cite an absence of qualifications as an objective reason for rejecting an applicant , when in truth the reason was more subjective where the right job is concerned , your extensive experience should more than compensate for the absence of more formal training i would strongly encourage you not to abandon recruitment as a prime goal the fact youve been called for interview six times is encouraging not all companies share the same hard edged attitude to recruitment and staff management that youve so far encountered you have long experience of working with the long term unemployed , the severely disabled and those with mental health problems and still you love helping people please hang on to that central truth whatever you do , dont even think of pretending to be less nice or more evil you wouldnt convince anyone and youd feel a fraud with optimistic perseverance , and employing some of the tips ive suggested to the reader above , you have every chance of finding what youre looking for readers say it sounds like youve been applying to recruitment agencies where the role is essentially a sales role one option is to look at in house recruiters where the roles are much more about assessment and selection , which sound like they would use your skills much better you could also look at applying for entry level recruitment and or hr roles often these come with the ability to do day release to gain a professional qualification with the cipd elizaben you work at the pointy end of human problems , which few people can do this makes you a relatively rare commodity would it help to approach yourself as if you were one of your own clients , and make the case for yourself that you would for them \?

were going close our rolling coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign , with a few hours and 10 days before election day you can read a summary of the days events here , about hillary clintons subsequent remarks on the new fbi review here , and about a falsehood strewn speech by donald trump in iowa here hillary clinton reacts to new fbi investigation into her emailshillary clinton demands fbi explain review of new batch of emails read more were a divided nation but we are fighting to bring us all together , like here tonight theres love here theres love , trump says we will make america wealthy again we will make america strong again we will make america safe again and we will make america great again god bless you with that trump closes out his rally we have the highest murder in this country in 45 years , trump says , very falsely trump is distorting an fbi statistic into a false claim in september the agency reported that murders and non negligent manslaughter rose in the us by 10 8 in 2015 , the largest single year increase since 1971 that is not the same as saying there are more murders in the us than at any point since 1971 15 , 696 murders were reported in 2015 , down from 1991 and 1993 highs of 24 , 703 and 24 , 526 there were more murders in 1971 \( 17 , 780 \) than in 2015 the murder rate declined 42 from 1993 to 2014 , even though the population increased by a quarter during this weeks debate trump almost cited the statistic accurately , saying we have an increase in murder within our cities , the biggest in 45 years the fbi figure is a national one , not restricted to cities you dont hear that from these people , he adds , gesturing toward the press they dont want to talk about it you can read our report on it , from the day of the release and before trump remarked on it , through the link below murders up 10 8 in biggest percentage increase since 1971 , fbi data shows read more when i am elected president i am going to keep radical islamic terrorists out of this country , trump says , without details and yes , we will build the wall and yes , mexico will pay for the wall 100 100 the cost of the wall is peanuts compared to what were talking about , trump says nonpartisan analysts estimate the wall would cost at least 25bn the us goods trade deficit with mexico is about 58bn , which is offset by the us surplus in services of 9 2bn if not for the open border policies of this administration , trump says , countless americans would be alive today the us does not have open borders , and barack obama has deported more than 2 5 million people , a record as trump himself noted at hte final presidential debate hillary has pledged open borders , trump says , and supports sanctuary cities clinton does not support open borders but does support sanctuary cities and reform to let people pass background checks and pay back taxes in order to stay in the us , and she supports obamas executive actions to shield some migrants , such as people who were brought to the us as children like obama , she supports deportation for people with criminal records we are going to have the biggest tax cut since ronald reagan this is only true if youre in the wealthiest bracket of american earners half of trumps tax cuts would go to the top 1 of earners , according to the tax policy center , and most families below the top 20 of earners would have income gains of less than 1 trump doesnt linger long on the affordable care act though he leads the crowd in a chant of drain the swamp , his new catchphrase for taking on corruption in washington forty five percent of african american children under the age of six are in poverty , trump says inaccurately , citing outdated data per politifact the poverty rates in question were as high as trump says they were at the depths of the great recession , but they have since eased , to somewhere between 20 percent and 37 percent , depending on which income threshold you use still , the rates for african american children are disproportionately high , so trump has a point even if his statistics are too old and exaggerate the scale of poverty in that age group on balance , we rate the statement half true another two million hispanic americans have fallen into poverty under the obama administration , he says , also falsely per the guardians own fact check trumps use of two million is misleading on two points he starts counting from 2008 , when george w bush was still in office and from right before the financial crisis peak and he ignores that the hispanic population has grown dramatically in the eight years since then almost 1 4 million hispanic people fell below the poverty line between 2008 and 2009 , census poverty numbers show , but the number of hispanic people in poverty has decreased during the recovery in 2015 it fell to 21 4 , down from 25 2 in 2009 it will be very hard to leave your farm to your children and your heirs , he says , alluding to the so called death tax on inheritance , though the estate tax actually only affects wealthy families and not the majority of americans trump then moves on to saying that hes really moving in the polls , and that hes leading in many of them this is not true , as election models and poll averages show i dont know whats going to happen now , trump continues so much is at stake in this election when we win in november we are going to have honest government once again hillary clinton destroyed 33 , 000 emails destroyed 13 iphones he then says , without evidence , that clinton put her office up for sale to corporations and foreign donors hacked emails show concerns within the campaign that clintons husband , bill , was too close with various donors , but no one has found evidence of a favor returned in exchange for donations to the clintons charitable foundation trump moves on to reminiscing about how , last june , he came down an elevator with his wife to announce his presidential campaign he abruptly segues into saying how were going to be the smart country once again , and saying we never win anymore abroad he correctly says that the white house has admitted healthcare premiums will increase by as much as 25 next year , but then misleadingly says that the true number is twice that premiums will increase by varying amounts according to each state some will be quite high , as trump warns , others will be far lower trump then correctly notes that obama misled americans about whether they could keep their doctor under the affordable care act repealing and replacing obamacare is one of the single most important reasons we must win on november 8 , trump says donald trump appears on stage in cedar rapids , iowa he thanks everybody as youve heard , earlier today , the fbi after discovering new emails the crowd cheers is reopening their investigation into hillary clinton this is not technically correct comey said the emails are part of a new review pertaining to the prior investigation lock her up , the crowd chants the investigation is the biggest political scandal since watergate , and its everybodys hope that justice at last can be delivered in the very brief remarks tonight hillary clinton tonight tried to politicize this investigation , trump continues , by attacking and falsely accusing the fbi director of only sending the letter to republicans another clinton lie as it turns out it was sent to both republican and democratic leaders trump says that the fbi would never have reopened this case at this time unless it were a most egregious criminal offense i give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong justice will prevail trump has suggested for months that the fbi has acted politically to hide alleged corruption someone is back at the podium after more than 45 minutes of waiting its not donald trump , but he praises the candidate , who is reportedly en route hes put his finger on a deeply underappreciated body of people , the man at the podium says he is going to be the next president of the united states of america then the man leaves the stage lets get the next president up here as of 6 45pm pt , trump has an 18 5 chance of winning the election and hillary clinton has a 81 5 chance , according to fivethirtyeights election model far from the podium in cedar rapids , vice president joe biden was asked by cnn about the new fbi review and the role that disgraced congressman anthony weiner plays in it kevin liptak \( kevinliptakcnn \) biden to cnn on new emails biden oh god anthony weiner i should not comment on anthony weiner im not a big fan october 29 , 2016meanwhile , the republican candidate has at last landed in the correct state donald j trump \( realdonaldtrump \) just landed in iowa speaking soon ! october 29 , 2016 trump is now an hour and 15 minutes late to his own rally , but reporting continues to trickle out from washington on fbi director james comeys decision to announce a review into emails of unknown significance officials speaking on condition of anonymity have told the washington post that he sent a cryptic letter today because of politics within the agency and with congress fbi director james b comey decided to inform congress that he would look again into hillary clintons handling of emails during her time as secretary of state for two main reasons a sense of obligation to lawmakers and a concern that word of the new email discovery would leak to the media and raise questions of a coverup the rationale , described by officials close to comeys decision making on the condition of anonymity , prompted the fbi director to release his brief letter to congress on friday and upset a presidential race less than two weeks before election day it placed comey again at the center of a highly partisan argument over whether the nations top law enforcement agency was unfairly influencing the campaign in a memo explaining his decision to fbi employees soon after he sent his letter to congress , comey said he felt an obligation to do so given that i testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed of course , we dont ordinarily tell congress about ongoing investigations , but here i feel i also think it would be misleading to the american people were we not to supplement the record , comey wrote to his employees greg sargent \( theplumlinegs \) important new reporting from sarihorwitz suggests comey sent letter because he felt pressure from inside https t co wwjrqgcqjh

belly of the beast for two years we are staring into the abyss i need your help will you help me \? he says he needs the audience to tell them about blum he begins talking about how his father fought in the second world war with a 10th grade education trump is nearly an hour late a mustachioed man named jeff addresses the crowd before trump , who is approximately 40 minutes late to the cedar rapids rally the man is shouting , and praising various republican candidates he says that voters are going to terrify democrats make them shiver and shake , cause theres a change a coming , and i can feel it in the air ! what hillary clinton did with those emails , i know its politically advantageous , but you know what folks , we had a secretary of state put our national security , thats your children , thats your grandchildren at stake folks , im a history professor , im going to tell you right now the history of our country , the history of our country , we dont have a precedent for whats going on jeff doesnt actually say anything about fbi agents july conclusions that clinton was extremely careless , or that they found no evidence that her server had been hacked , though they thought it at risk goetz returns im glad jeff got that out of his system a congressman , rod blum , appears on stage hello o o o , deplorables ! he says he represents iowans in washington dc , which he then says is infested and a swamp we are fed up with the lying , we are fed up with the corruption , we are fed up with people who go there to serve themselves , he says still waiting for donald trump , tana goetz , a former apprentice contestant , comes out onto the stage to pep up the crowd by dismissing hillary clinton just across the river then someone holds a moment of prayer for donald trump and mike pence then goetz introduces a man to lead the crowd in the pledge of allegiance a cedar rapids music teacher takes the lead for the national anthem goetz says that trump took a chance on me , a woman , an iowan , and an entrepreneur what he showed me was enough to put my successful careers on hold , she says , to campaign for trump hes got a huge heart , she says i know this mans heart and it is good and he genuinely loves people you cant live in new york city and not love people this last statement is not true but goetz goes on to say that she knows how much this man loves this country he doesnt need this job donald trumps gonna win this thing in a landslide and its gonna happen i predicted it and its gonna happen she then says the fbi is re opening the case , alluding to the new review into a new batch of emails related to hillary clinton , and the crowd chants lock her up as we wait for trump to speak in iowa , the state has reported its third suspected case of attempted voter fraud in a donald trump supporter , according to the des moines register terri lynn rote , 55 , was booked into the polk county jail about 3 40pm thursday on a first degree election misconduct charge , which is a class d felony rote , a registered republican , reportedly cast an early voting ballot at the polk county election office , 120 second ave , and another ballot at a county satellite voting location in des moines , according to a des moines police report its the first time in 12 years that polk county auditor jamie fitzgerald can remember ever having to report potential voter fraud , he said thursday morning the other two suspects are accused of casting mail in ballots and also voting in person , according to police reports as of friday morning , neither of those suspects had been arrested the case is under investigation by des moines police i think it shows that our voting system works in iowa , that were able to catch it , fitzgerald said tensions are running high on both sides as election day approaches , the county auditor said , but the cases of double voting could also have been simple mistakes thats not for me to decide , he said rote was held in jail on a 5 , 000 bond , but she had been released as of friday afternoon her next court appearance was scheduled for nov 7 , court records show trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that voter fraud is rampant throughout the electorate , and especially in largely black precincts of philadelphia and chicago it is not the businessman has also suggested that he would not mind voter fraud perpetrated in his favor , saying at a rally last week , well , if theyre gonna vote for me , well think about it , right \? voter intimidation fears follow trump 's call for 'volunteer election

defense clinton had dodged giving a clear answer about her opinion of the ongoing case during a presidential primary debate in early 2008 , though she suggested that the supreme court would probably find a full ban on handguns unconstitutional but in 2015 , the washington free beacon reported , clinton told an audience at a private event that the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment and i am going to make that case every chance i get thats an opinion that is shared by many people including some of the liberal justices on the supreme court , who argued in their dissent that the second amendment was intended to protect the right of people in each state to form militias , not to limit lawmakers ability to regulate civilian gun ownership but that particular view is not one that is

russell , the scottish governments brexit minister , has been updating holyrood this afternoon on his work , including further detail from mondays meeting of the devolved leaders at downing street it would be fair to say that the mood remains bullish , with russell telling msps that the talks had made it clearer than ever that there is at present no coherent uk plan he went on but there has to be a scottish plan , and ideally that should be one that is good for the uk too alongside our efforts to influence the united kingdom to adopt a soft brexit with continued membership of the single market the scottish government will bring forward our own detailed proposals to protect scotlands interests by the end of this year russell said that a key part of these proposals would be setting out ways in which scotland can remain in the single market , even if the rest of the uk leaves he also reported that , on a visit to brussels last week , he had met guy verhofstadt , part of the european parliaments brexit negotiating team , who much to the scottish governments delight is previously on record saying if scotland decides to leave the uk , to be an independent state , and they decide to be part of the eu , i think there is no big obstacle to do that the difficulties in concluding an eu canada trade deal show the importance of britain reaching an agreement over its future relationship with the eu before it leaves the bloc , international trade secretary liam fox has said reuters reports that fox told the commons european scrutiny committee that the seven years it has taken to reach the ceta deal and the delays in signing it after it was rejected by a belgian regional authority showed the difficulty of doing a deal with such a large number of partners article 50 of the eus lisbon treaty allows for an initial two year period of divorce talks before britain leaves the bloc any agreement reached in that time would not be subject to the same level of vetos as a free trade agreement \( fta \) , he said that sort of procedure would only be undertaken were we to leave the european union after our article 50 period without any agreement whatsoever and were looking to seek a new fta from outside its in the interests quite clearly following this \( ceta \) experience for all concerned to minimise any sort of economic trade and political disruption to ensure thats done with the minimum of fuss staying with the richmond park byelection , the lib dem leader , tim farron , has said it represents an an opportunity to send a message to theresa may over her hard brexit strategy and change the direction of the country , the press association reports speaking on richmond green , directly below the heathrow flight path , farron pitched his party as the only clear , electable alternative to goldsmith on the face of it the lib dems have a mountain to climb goldsmith held the south west london constituency with an increased majority of more than 23 , 000 in last years general election and his stand on heathrow is likely to be highly popular locally but , heartened by a strong performance in david camerons former constituency of witney last week , farron said his party were determined to take the fight to goldsmith he said we start here as second favourites , theres no two ways about it , theres a big mountain to climb , but its one were determined to have a good crack at the ability for people of richmond park to really change the way our country heads is over brexit are we going to leave the eu or are we going to leave the single market , risking jobs and livelihoods in this part of london \? if you want to stop theresa may taking us down this extreme path that no one voted for , then a vote for the liberal democrats will send a powerful message and could literally change the direction of our country farron suggested he would not be moving to parachute a big name in to contest the seat , saying it was a matter for the local party liberal democrats leader tim farron speaks to the media on richmond green , directly below the heathrow flight path photograph jack hardy pahe said the reason why the announcement was made this week is because we now have a conservative government without the liberal democrats stopping them , so the liberal democrats are the only people who have stopped the third runway so far its a confusing choice in some sense , because \( goldsmith \) , who says hes opposed to heathrow , is being supported by a party which is making the heathrow expansion happen to vote for zac goldsmith is basically to give succour to a tory government that is expanding heathrow activists are set to pour the richmond park constituency in a bid to capitalise on their success in last weeks by election the conservative majority in former prime minister mr camerons old seat was slashed from 25 , 000 to 5 , 700 with a 19 swing , while the lib dems came second despite having finished a distant fourth in 2015 the lib dems held richmond park until 2010 it is one of their biggest local parties with 800 members , and it enjoys support in neighbouring seats as well the constituency voted 69 for remain in the referendum while goldsmith was among the leading conservatives campaigning for leave compass has joined labour mps clive lewis , lisa nandy and jonathan reynolds in calling for the party not to put forward a candidate to run against zac goldsmith in the forthcoming richmond park byelection the soft left pressure group said in a statement the richmond park by election is a huge progressive opportunity zac goldsmith ran a racially divisive campaign for the london mayoralty , and was staunchly in favour of the leave side in this years referendum now , his decision to trigger this latest contest in which he is the de facto tory candidate offers a chance to reject the politics of division , reduce the tories already slender majority , oppose hard brexit in a seat that was overwhelming remain and show what can happen when progressive parties work together , not against each other this is why we are calling on the progressive parties to get round the table and agree which has the maximum chance of defeating the tories the lib dems held the seat until 2010 when they got 43 of the vote and the result of the witney by election suggests they could win in richmond park if other progressive parties agree not to run competing candidates that simply wastes votes and let the tories in it calls on the lib dems to select a pro european anti third runway candidate and says there should be reciprocal alliances in future to prevent tory candidates getting in the statement concludes there is a precedent such an alliance worked in tatton in 1997 when the progressive parties put the national interest before party interest and stood down to defeat the tories it is such a moment once more zac goldsmith triggered the richmond park byelection after resigning over heathrow expansion photograph dan kitwood getty images much to the annoyance of many commentators watching pmqs , jeremy corbyn did not bring up theresas secret speech to goldman sachs warning of the dangers of brexit here , the guardians home affairs editor , alan travis , explains why what she said is important it clearly shows that in private she was prepared to articulate a much stronger attachment to staying in the european union than the lukewarm public support she gave to the remain campaign in the one major public speech she made during the campaign there is also a reason to believe that the goldman sachs speech was much closer to her own personal views because they reflect the fact that mays entire career before going into politics was at the bank of england and as a european lobbyist for the financial service industry carefully calculated shifts in language have led some to conclude she is now set on the path to hard brexit but her private goldman sachs speech just five months ago makes clear that she personally believes a future out of the single market means a business exodus from britain perhaps she should spell out her views about hard brexit to the british people rather than giving american bankers the inside track amnesty international uk has backed jeremy corbyns stance on saudi arabia during pmqs the labour leader urged theresa may to stop selling arms to the kingdom because of its attacks in yemen amnesty international uks arms control director oliver sprague said week in week out weve documented the saudi arabia led coalitions appalling attacks on homes , hospitals and funeral halls in yemen , and week in week out the government has ducked the need to stop selling weapons to saudi arabia its simply not good enough instead of retreating into vague remarks about issues being investigated , theresa may should order an immediate halt to all further arms sales to saudi arabia , as well as a full inquiry into what part british weaponry may have played in fuelling the terrible conflict in yemen jeremy corbyn has accused theresa may of not having a brexit plan he raised laughs at pmqs as he quoted baldrick from blackadder saying our cunning plan is to have no plan he continued brexit was apparently about taking back control but the devolved governments dont know the plan , businesses dont know the plan , parliament doesnt know the plan

signalled controls on immigration are the most important thing to secure from a brexit deal corbyn faced criticism from some commentators for not raising the recording at pmqs labour frontbenchers clive lewis , lisa nandy and jonathan reynolds have urged the party not to stand a candidate against zac goldsmith in the byelection in his richmond seat , triggered by his resignation over heathrow

election it is understood labour will stand but the green party hinted they may not contest the seat the president of the european parliament , martin schulz , has referred the altercation earlier

how is everyone doing \? ready for november 8 yet \? tonight , i was asked to speak about a vision for the next hundred years of reproductive choice and justice its such a wonderful frame to think about what a feminist future might look like but i bet like a lot of you , its hard to imagine what the next hundred years will look like when so much of that , for women especially , will depend on what happens in just 18 days there is no overstating how important this election is its not just about the next four or eight years this decision is about sending a message about who we are as a country , and setting a very particular course for the women who live here well look back on this time as a watershed moment a moment that could , in fact , shape the next hundred years of womens rights but first i want to share a personal story a little over six years ago , i was pregnant with my daughter , layla and when i was 28 weeks pregnant , i got incredibly ill i developed pre eclampsia , which some of you might know is dangerously high blood pressure during pregnancy i was admitted to the hospital and within just a few days , i developed another complication called hellp syndrome , the short version being my liver was in danger of failing , and i was in danger of dying if my daughter was not born i had an emergency c section and layla was born weighing 2lb 2oz she stayed in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first two months of her life , undergoing medical interventions to save and protect her that to this day i try to avoid thinking about but i was lucky , and she was lucky , and today shes a wonderful healthy six year old and i feel grateful for that every day i share this story often , because this was something in my life that changed me forever , that shaped who i am today and when i think about this moment , what i think about most often is how fortunate i was that i got sick far enough along in my pregnancy that i wasnt faced with the reality of needing an abortion to save my life and when i think about those days in the hospital the fear , the urgency , the confusion , the stress the idea that the government could ever become involved in my lifes most pivotal moment \? it horrifies me so one thing i want for the next hundred years \? i want for no person , ever , to fear that their most personal life choices will be made by someone else i want for no woman , ever , to be afraid that her scariest life moment will be made even more difficult and traumatic by government interference in the next hundred years , i want to see every woman be free from the fear that her body is not really her own and thats why i want to talk about this election tonight because thats whats at stake never before in american politics have womens bodies been so front and center in the national conversation and so at risk we are choosing between a candidate who has spent her political career fighting for reproductive rights , and a candidate who says that women who have abortions need to be punished a candidate who said this week in the final debate unequivocally that she will defend planned parenthood , and a candidate who promised to defund it a choice between a person who has spent her life in public service , and a braggadocious businessman who rips off his workers and , perhaps most tellingly were making a decision between a woman who has said that womens rights are human rights and a man who says if you want to , you can just grab women by the pussy theres a feminist rallying cry online right now that i like a lot , and it says november 8 , pussy grabs back now , i know that so much has been made of that comment , and the ensuing allegations against trump by multiple women that he did just what he bragged about doing on that tape and while some people may not see the link between sexual assault and reproductive rights , those of us here in this room know better we know that there is a direct connection between those who think they can touch womens bodies without permission and those who think they can legislate our bodies reproductive rights and justice has always been about a fundamental respect or in this case , disrespect of womens bodily integrity and autonomy either our bodies are our own , or theyre not and make no mistake , the conversation that were having right now about groping is not just salacious media fodder the way we come out of this moment the direction our culture shifts because of it will absolutely determine womens rights in the future we are witnessing a moment where our country could move backwards back to a place where boys will be boys and men will make decisions for women or towards a future where our culture and politics understand and respect women as autonomous full human beings those are the two paths right now , im optimistic that were on the right one the one that brings us to the feminist future all of us in this room have been waiting for when trump said he wanted to punish women for having abortions , there was outrage and he had to walk back those comments but more importantly , pro choice activists and organizations like planned parenthood were there to point out that while other politicians may not say they want women to be punished , thats exactly what would happen if abortion were made illegal and in fact , what has already happened to women like purvi patel , who was put in prison for inducing her own abortion in indiana our feminist future has no place for criminalizing women who decide if and when to parent when donald trump claimed that what he said on that access hollywood tape was just locker room talk , and later when former new york city mayor rudy giuliani said that all men talk like this , men across the country came out to say no this is not normal this is not acceptable men are better than this the feminist future that were fighting for has men fighting alongside of us , men who refuse to be insulted by antiquated and sexist ideals about what it means to be a real man when trump claimed that the women who have accused him of sexual assault were not attractive enough to warrant his unwanted attention , when he called women disgusting , when he called women pigs , the media who can so often get things wrong took him to task because our feminist future is not one where misogyny will go unchecked women have been disparaged and harassed for too many years , and were not going to take one more minute of it were done of course this feminist future the future that were so close to getting its not just being hinted at by the reaction and opposition to donald trump we are getting a sense of what that future could look like when we see the incredible way feminists and women themselves have changed the conversation this week , for the first time ever , a presidential candidate offered a nuanced and empathetic defense of late term abortions on a national debate stage this is a third rail issue that most politicians wont touch , but clinton talked about womens lives and experiences in a way that reminded us that this issue isnt just about policy its about us were living in a moment when feminism is wielding more cultural power than it has in decades , maybe ever people dont shy away from the word feminism any more , they embrace it when i started speaking on college campuses 10 years ago , i would ask how many people in the room considered themselves feminists back then , just a few people would raise their hands when i speak at colleges today , nearly everyone does feminism has become so popular that the conservative right has tried to appropriate it sarah palin calls herself a feminist , anti choice organizations call themselves the real feminists they recognize the power that the word and the movement have , and they want to use it toward their own , very anti feminist , ends but our feminist future is a smart one , and it knows that anyone who would legislate womens bodies , who would interfere in womens and families private medical decisions have no place calling themselves feminists of course , being in this incredible feminist moment when the first female president is about to win by taking down a man who is as close to a caricature of misogyny as you can get being in this moment doesnt mean that our feminist future is guaranteed its not those of us who have been doing this work for years know that every time women make political and cultural strides , there is an intense backlash were in the midst of it now , and it will only intensify if hillary clinton becomes president making sure that this backlash doesnt define us that we are not put on the defensive by it that is what will truly determine our feminist future will we get pushed back on our heels or will we look straight ahead and move forward \? will we rest on our laurels because we have the first woman president or will we take our moment to celebrate and then move on to the hard work that still needs to be done \? if the people in this room , and the people at planned parenthood are any indication we know the answer to those questions this is just the beginningmy daughter tells me that she wants children one day \( though she says she doesnt want to be pregnant her wife will have the kids \) but when she talks about having children , when i think about being a grandmother or a even great grandmother one day thats when i think about those hundred years that weve been talking about i think about what the world will be like for them and i have faith , i really do , that it will be a world that this will be a country where people determine their own destiny a world where we understand that reproductive rights are not just an issue of womens bodies but an economic issue , a family issue , and a human rights issue and the reason i have faith that future generations will see this vision of feminism and justice unfold is because of activists like you all here because of planned parenthood every day they are ensuring that the next hundred years will be years where womens words , lives , bodies and experiences matter years where were not defending ourselves from attack , but building something progressive and something real all of you in this room are doing what is necessary to ensure that feminist future i could not be more grateful to you , and i could not be more honored to join that fight with you topicsfeminismwomenabortionhillary clintonfeaturesshare on facebookshare on twittershare via emailshare on linkedinshare on pinterestshare

think that is exactly the bias that people are upset by ! i think that your defensiveness on this may speak volumes , sir , kelly deadpanned what i said is , if donald trump is a sexual predator ,

showed trump bragging about being able to sexually assault women with impunity because of his fame then we saw ten women come forward after he actually denied doing it at a debate , to say that was untrue , he did it to me he did it to me he did it to me we saw it with reporters , people who had worked with him , people from apprentice , and so on and so forth he denies it it all , which is his right we dont know what the truth is my point to you is , as a media story , we dont get to say the ten women are lying , kelly continued we have to cover that story , sir gingrich dismissed kellys assertion , and decried the amount of focus paid on trumps sexual assault accusations you are fascinated with sex , and you dont care about public policy ! gingrich responded and thats what i get out of watching you tonight im not fascinated by sex , but i am fascinated by protection of women and understanding what were getting in the oval office , kelly retorted its not about me its about the women and men of america , and the poll numbers show us that the women of america , in particular , are very concerned about these allegations the former speaker of the house of representatives
