Anti-Trump street protests linked to the Soros funded organization MoveOn.org have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the 2016 presidential election result. Mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC have given the protests around-the-clock media coverage, drowning out all other news stories, including a successful transition meeting between the President Elect and President Barack Obama. OUTSIDER VS. INSIDER Manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of Trump presidency. (Photo Illustration 21WIREs Shawn Helton) The Free Thought Project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated anti-Trump protests organized in part by by the George Soros NGO MoveOn: Washington, D.C.  Billionaire globalist financier George Soros MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation  and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. Wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle , and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today. In light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous. Soros affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: Americans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results Hundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. Tonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesdays presidential election. The gatherings  organized by MoveOn.org and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trumps bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible. Within two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon. Soros Agit-Prop Empire Last year during the ongoing European migrant crisis, startling claims were levied by Hungarian PM Victor Orban (left photo), concerning the role played by Soros. PM Orban contended that the founder and chair of Open Society Foundations (Open Society Institute), was entrenched in a  circle of activists, that inadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network. The stunning declaration by Orban recalled the misguided machinations of The Occupy Movement ( aka OWS) in 2011, as well as the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, along with other Black Lives Matter protests this past year  all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants (along with paid provocateurs) into violent action and social unrest. Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. Its worth mentioning, that MoveOn also supported the Obama campaign in 2008 and according to the website, Sanders was the only other candidate to reach the threshold for an endorsement. As we said back in March, professional political agitator flash mobs, had been mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign  as activists attempted to take away Trumps strength in numbers at his rallies. This was confirmed at events in both Ohio, and at a Trump primary campaign event the University of Illinois Chicago earlier this year, where hundreds of BLM activists and Sanders supporters, triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage , shortly after Trump started speaking, then again at Reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort Trump away. In a Politico article in early 2016 entitled  Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter , we gained deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: Major donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression, said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement. It worth noting how Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to boost Clintons campaign . Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trumps rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond. Look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country  as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances. SOCIAL ENGINEERING Political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media, NGOs and social media. (Image Source: abc news ) During the last month, it was revealed how investigative non-profit Project Veritas found evidence that the DNC paid participants to incite violence at Trump rallies during the course of the 2016 election. If those reports are accurate  reports which have gone unchallenged so far  this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also US criminal law. PAID PROTEST? Social justice warriors incite anti-Trump violence across the US. (Image Source: youtube ) USA Color Revolutions Both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption, and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare. These political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions. Ultimately, a radical globalist and cultural marxist progressive agenda is at play  eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial color upheavals, and where possible  weakening a countrys national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the publics political perspective. This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization color revolution campaigns overseas , and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US. Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org , as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this weeks protests. It still remains to be seen if Trumps stated dynamic political vision for America can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world, in addition to helping economic woes at home, or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism. This remains to be seen. Certainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clintons total silence over their own partys role in fomenting this weeks unrest  one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable  to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency. But one thing is for sure  theres no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the 45th president and the public should question why. Legal Action Against Soros Groups In a recent report featured at RT news we learn that George Soros and BLM activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge: The father of the Dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a Black Lives Matter protest is suing the organizations activists and George Soros for $550 million . In a separate suit a Baton Rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a BLM protest. The father of Patrick Zamarripa filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and other groups for allegedly inciting a war on police that led to the death of his son. The lawsuit filed in US District Court in Dallas on Monday seeks $550 million in damages. While Defendant Black Lives Matter claims to combat anti-black racism, the lawsuit said, according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram, the movement has in fact incited and committed further violence, severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities, Jews, and Caucasians. Defendant Black Lives Matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang. The misguided machinations behind the anti-Trump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the president-elect. Will these protest groups be a reboot of the OWS movement, occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into 2017 and beyond? More from the Duran below  NEO BLACK BLOC?

 page: 1 link Its ok to call us white Trump supporters all that but when You mess with our black friends then that's another issue. Democrats need to realize that some black folks and white folks all grew up with different opportunities and school zones, that is SO RACIST to call them uneducated, its fine to call us whites that but not our black brothers and sisters, the Hispanics and all other non whites. How dare the Clintons offend our black and other minority members , Im sure some liberal will come along and say something totally ignorant like trump doesn't have and black supporters, well he does, over 20% of them. True, the democrats didn't single out the blacks and minorities, they referred to all of us as lots of things, all of us AMERICANS that weren't equal in our financial upbringings. You see, I see all of us Trump supporters as 3 colors, red white and blue. I see us all as Ameicans and not trying to DIVIDE people like the democrats.
 page: 1 Statement by Gov. Bill Weld This is basically a backwards endorsement of Hillary. Against that backdrop, I would like to address myself to all those in the electorate who remain torn between two so-called major party candidates whom they cannot enthusiastically support. Im speaking particularly to those Republicans who feel that our President should exhibit commonly accepted standards of decency and discipline. *snip After careful observation and reflection, I have come to believe that Donald Trump, if elected President of the United States, would not be able to stand up to this pressure and this criticism without becoming unhinged and unable to perform competently the duties of his office. I wonder what effect this will have on Libertarian Party members if any. I think it's unfortunate that people are feeling forced to support Hillary in order to stop Trump. Trump supporters need to take a long hard look in the mirror and realize that such a repulsive person, a man some voted for just for the lulz has ensured a Clinton presidency. You didn't stand up to the establishment you sent people fleeing to it. a reply to:  Check out the pretend libertarian! If I were libertarian, I'd be ticked off. Here's part of my supposed ticket endorsing one of the least libertarian candidates ever by making a fear play. what a bunch of doo doo feces this thread is. so voting for trump isnt standing up to the establisment? have you not watched veritas? have you not read anything from wikileaks? at this point im completely convinced if hillary wins this election, every women in america will be wearing a hijab within her presidency. the draft will make a return because we will be at war with russia and china. ok trump isnt a politician. and at this point, i dont think thats what we need. being president doesnt mean you have to be involved in politics your whole life. president of the us should be someone who has the values of america instilled in their heart. they should have america first mentality. hillary wants a 550% increase in muslim refugees. the same ones murdering and raping women throughout europe. the same ones who think because a woman isnt islamic, they can do whatever they want to them. hillary wants amnesty and open borders... great, so lots more columbian drug lords sending people over our border i want to feel safe in my own country. thats all i want. not fancy tax plans, free college, more jobs. trump makes me feel safe.
Homeless TRUMP Supporter Guards Donald Trumps Star on Hollywood Blvd page: 1 On Wednesday a violent leftist smashed Donald Trumps star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The culprits used a sledgehammer to destroy Donalds star. The person who was watching Trumps star had an anti-immigration sign and is pro-trump. Later another homeless man took up the watch to keep Trumps star on Hollywood BLVD safe. From the video it looks like the star had already been replaced. Could this be a plant? And has Trump secured the homeless vote? Everybody's looking for a gimmick, and their 15 minutes of fame. Sad, really. Really sad. Maybe he wants a home. Another stinkin' deplorable. link Ill bet Hillary laughs at him because he is homeless and like Trump. I would give him money if I lived there. The violent destructive liberals just cant stop stealing signs, spray painting buildings and now vandalizing a sidewalk, wow but not surprised, the liberals have been so dirty not only Hillary and her supporters but her whole entourage that it makes this years election a new low in lows and sets a really bad example for the next election.
Is google and YouTube in the Hillarys purse? page: 1 link After I posted my opening post (OP) on Hillary Clinton Wants a Strong Russia. Wait, what did she say? , mysteriously, my YouTube account gets wiped out. The next thing I notice, is that the youtube video that I used in my OP, www.... suddenly wont work. Has anyone else experienced this bizarre behavior before? Is this what we are to expect if Hillary becomes POTUS? I went to the Youtube site and the video is available. www.youtube.com... I frankly, don't know what to think about this. link a reply to:  yes, so is almost all the major media, magazines (that are left), most of hollywood, GOP kinda, most of the bush's. Who else? Google is pro clinton like drudge is pro trump without a doubt Just about every news story under google news is pro hillary and negative towards trump.

Here's the transcript: Benton: We're doing pretty well ahhh but we don't have anywhere near the funds that Hillary's groups do so we really have to be surgical Benton: So we have a voter suppression campaign  quite frankly  targeting African Americans , and uh, and sort of, suburban moms , just bad stuff about Hillary, just trying to take their taste for her away. Female Reporter: I see, so that they don't turn out. Benton: Yeah just keep them  just try to drop her turn out two or three points Basically if they put out enough negative adds about how she hasn't supported blacks and there causes they will make it less likely they will vote for her. Realistically speaking they aren't going to votell republican and they know that. So the best they can hope for is make them mad enough at her not to vote. But looking at early voting they may have switched more than they thought and instead of bit voting they are voting trump wI'll see as election. Gets cloaer.
11 Shares10 0 0 1I grew up in a working class family and have experienced the deep racism of a society that views Vietnamese Americans as the targets of war. I've lived through successive Democratic Party administrations with little to celebrate. The Bill Clinton era brought NAFTA, which outsourced my Aunt's union job and forced her into the low-wage service sector. My mother never found a living wage job and relied on my father's public sector union position to meet our family's needs. In the 21st century, Obama expanded Bushs War on Terror, which merged my fathers job with into the Department of Homeland Security.Downward pressure on wages and working conditions forced my father to refinance our home multiple times to pay college expenses for my sister and I. Even then, my sister and I graduated with large sums of student debt. I have worked four jobs in three years and only one has paid a truly living wage. Another four years of a Democratic Party President was not going to make anything better for my family. That is not to say that Donald Trump was the answer to the structural problems of exploitation. But Trump's victory is not the end of the world, either.Trump's victory is the product of global capitalisms decay. Millions of people voted for Trump for a variety of reasons, namely because he clearly labeled problems and outlined solutions to them. I dont agree with all of his solutions. White nationalism stains his domestic and international agenda. Trumps call to further militarize the US-Mexico border yet make peace with Russia is a contradiction in and of itself. A white nationalist billionaire who speaks the language of racism on the one hand and the interests of peace on the other is not exactly a model of consistency.However, Trumps consistency is not the most important aspect of this election. Millions of people have shown their disgust with the two-party system of the capitalist class. A number of mostly white workers and whites from the petty business class voted for Trump. Trump also received more votes than expected from the Black and Latino electorate. Meanwhile, the elections produced a low turnout for Clinton from the historic Democratic Party bases of Black voters, Latino voters, and women voters. Clinton may have won the electoral vote, but the balance of forces ensured the ruling class would gamble on Trump. Trump's base of white workers and petty business elites angered by thirty years of monopoly capitalist assault are more of a threat at the moment than the millions of Democratic party voters who are now without a home. The round table of elites called the Electoral College could not afford any more damage to the Democratic Party than what transpired during the election.So the Democratic Party is now on its deathbed and there is only one class of people willing to resurrect it: white liberals. A large section of the Democratic Party base wanted Bernie Sanders to be their next President. They did not hold their nose for Clinton. The legitimate concerns that immigrants and oppressed people possess with Trump's racism should not be led into the bowels of the Democratic Party. Yet for white liberals, this is the ultimate mission.MORE... Brian Cloughley: The Greatest Achievement of Mr. Trump would be Engage in Positive Discussions with Russia and China Arise President Trump (or Why it's not the End of the World as We Know it) Trump's sexual predator characteristics - His Grandfather was a pimp, but at least he paid the women he hired The significance of the GOP's attempted purge of Donald Trump Trump's victory has energized the white liberal section of the United States to fight back. White liberals began the process in a deep state of mourning over Clinton's loss. They then placed blame for Trumps victory on Russia, low-voter turnout, and the white working class. White liberals have blamed everyone except Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Now, white liberals in the US hope to wage a crusade against Trump in hopes of a Democratic Party recovery. It is all too clear that their primary intention is to get ahead of the genuine forces that rejected both Trump and Clinton and lead them into the Democratic Party graveyard.White liberals love to hide their own racism and ruling class sensibilities through a process of appeal and betrayal. They speak with the authority of moral righteousness on the one hand and the knife of oppression on the other. They talk down to the struggle of peoples oppressed by white supremacy and attempt to steer it in a way that benefits their class interests. White liberals despise the working class because they understand that there will come a day when it destroys the system that they profit so handsomely from.White liberals usually originate from the ruling class, the managerial class, and various stripes of the professionalized sector. Their class has ordained themselves the true leaders of "human rights" based on race, gender, and sexual equality. However, White liberals speak of human rights on the basis of a complete abandonment of the material struggle for liberation. In other words, the white liberal is the ultimate counterrevolutionary force in US society. It has wielded the so-called struggle for human rights as a weapon to prevent the emergence of class-consciousness among the oppressed and its genuine leaders.The 2016 elections have shown that the broad class arrangement of white liberals is indeed in crisis and only has itself to blame. White liberals cannot acknowledge that it was their brand of politics that led to the Trump moment. Their dominance over the left in the US ensured that no organized force existed strong enough to challenge the ills of capitalist decline. Millions of people voted for Sanders based on his demands for material relief. Millions of people voted for Trump for the similar reasons, his racism and sexism notwithstanding. Whatever racism and sexism existed in his rhetoric could not "trump" the fact that the trade deals and wars he spoke out against in part drove ordinary people to vote for him. If the Trump base wanted racism and sexism primarily, they would of voted for Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush in the primaries.So White liberal anger about Trump's victory is not directed at sexism, racism, or any other aspect of Trump's politics. White liberals are afraid of the sharpening contradictions of US society that threaten to squeeze them out of their privileged position under the racist and capitalist order. Millions of people are now asking where white liberalism was during the massive loss in working class income and wealth that occurred over the last forty years? Where were the White liberals during the endless wars that have been waged even more fervently by Democratic Party Administrations? Where were the White liberals during the erection of the largest police and prison state in the world, the institutions that murder and incarcerate Black Americans in record numbers and deport undocumented peoples at historic rates?The answer is that white liberals were supporting the US capitalist system's assault on the oppressed every step of the way. This is what they are trying to hide with their anger over Trump. We cannot defeat Trump's white nationalism if the white liberal is not defeated with just as much vigor. White liberal ideology has a history of infecting social movements. As it spreads, it breeds the germs of Democratic Party control over these movements. But the Democratic Party made its own bed by acting as the more effective evil of the ruling class. If a powerful movement of the working class is to emerge in the age of Trump, then we must fight hard against the white liberal forces working hard to resuscitate the Democratic Party and build an independent party of our own.
9 Shares[ Note: Here "Liberalism" (capitalized) refers to an approach to just governance based on equality and liberty. Within that broader, philosophical ideology there are narrower, political ideologies ranging from libertarianism, to conservatism, to liberalism (lower case), to democratic socialism. Mutual respect beats all of them, separately or together. ]We humans are by nature social beings. We live together in organized groups. (Let's call our groups, regardless of size, from hamlets to nation-states, "communities.")Ants and bees are social insects. They, too, live in organized groups.Ants and bees do not have the capacity to decide what the organization of their groups will be. We do.In fact, we humans have no choice but to decide how a community will be organized, which largely determines how it will function. So, governance is an unavoidable issue for us.Not to be a spoiler, but the case for using mutual respect for governing governance ends with maximum practical liberty, reinforced political democracy, and a market-based economy. For the citizens of communities with those forms of social organization already in place, the only noticeable changes in their lives would be the elimination of unemployment, poverty, taxation, and public debtwell, those things plus passively helping with environmental sustainability.[Curious readers uninterested in slogging through a philosophical tract can go directly to www.ajustsolution.com (Page: real justice /economics).]Two ubiquitous processes of human communitiesEvery human community will always have an economy and a political process. The economy is the process of producing and exchanging goods and services. The political process is the process of effecting choices for the community as a whole. [By "effecting choices" I mean choosing among perceived alternatives and taking action to bring that choice to fruition.]Choosing how the community's economy will be organized is one of the tasks for the political process. (To go with economic laissez faire is to effect a choice.) Choosing how the community's political process will be organized is itself a choice to be effected for the community as a whole.Organizing principleThe structure and overall functioning of the political process is determined by an organizing principle. That principle can be implicit or explicit, secular or religious, consciously derived or a matter of happenstance. For every human community, though, there is always an organizing principle at work.History teaches us that there is a 'default value' for the organizing principle of communities. That is to say, there is one organizing principle that will be used if no other one is chosen in its stead. In the absence of any other, the organizing principle of human communities will be 'rule by the most ruthless'.Understandably, people have sought other organizing principles. The Modern era is defined, socially, by the attempt to use some secular conception of justice as an organizing principle for society. In doing that ideology was invented.[Karl Marx, whose work has been hugely influential in this era, denied that a principle of justice was at work in his "scientific" account of the 'inevitable' development of human society ("dialectical materialism"), but his work definitely had a moral content. Otherwise, there can be nothing wrong with "exploitation," even to the point of slavery. To apply any conception of morality to governance can be said to be an attempt at justice.]Enter Locke... John LockeThe most influential account of justice in the Modern era is that of John Locke. In Two Treatises of Government , published in 1689 in England, he made equality and liberty the basis of justice. Every Western philosopher since him has been required to endorse or refute equality and liberty.Equality was the topic of the first of Locke's treatises. Though the thrust of his philosophy was to make governance more secular and less dependent on religion (ideological as opposed to theological), for him equality came from the Bible. In that treatise of his a fundamental moral equality among men is an underlying condition that must be upheld for there to be justice in the governance of a community.[A claim of moral equality can be purely secular, but in the England of Locke's time that was no more likely than claiming equality for women was. Also, in that time and place, as among so many others, the topic of governance left women out or treated them as property.]In Locke's second treatise he made a case for liberty as the predicate of justice. He used two accounts of liberty to make that case.First, Locke asserted that liberty is a 'Natural Right'. He did not invent the idea of Natural Rights. Like so many ideas in Western culture, it can be traced back to the ancient Greeks. It was also discussed by scholars of the medieval Catholic Churchas grants of a kind ordained by God within the 'Natural Law', i.e. the law 'written on the hearts of men' by the Lord.The idea of 'rights' was already deeply ingrained in the people populating the British Iles in Locke's time. Natural Rights is one formulation of the idea that there are certain Rights to which all people are entitled merely by virtue of being human (dropping the genderism). Locke said that the Natural Rights are life, liberty, and property. For people who believe in Natural Rightsor any other form of a priori Rightsfor any of those Rights to be arbitrarily violated is on the face of it an injustice.In Locke's other account of liberty as the predicate of justice he started by defining injustice as being "subject to the arbitrary will" of another person. Thus, freedom from the arbitrary will of any other person is justice. To be free of the arbitrary will of any other person is obviously at the same time to enjoy liberty. Locke therefore concluded with perfect logic that justice is liberty.The problem Locke left usThere are all kinds of problems with liberty as the predicate of justice. On the face of it, can people running around doing whatever they want really be relied upon to result in just outcomes?If justice is liberty, the answer has to be that whatever results from people doing whatever they want is just. Outcomes are beside the point. To see what that would look like, as my good friend who is a doctor is fond of saying, watch any episode of the T.V. show Deadwood . For my money, that show portrays a rather benign version of a community with unconstrained liberty as its organizing principle.For Locke, the Natural Rights of life and property trump liberty of that kind. Everyone's liberty is constrained by those Rights. Yet, liberty itself is also a Right. Bertrand Russell said that Locke was a "successful" philosopher because every time he saw a contradiction looming he simply changed the subject.When constraints are put on liberty to achieve justice, then those constraints become the real determiners of justice. In that case, outcomes do enter into the evaluation of justice. Liberty becomes one possible "social good" (from John Rawls) among others.Setting aside more philosophical complaints and the chances for violent mayhem ending in rule by the most ruthless, focusing on rights, especially Rights, begets a self-centered approach to life. It's all about ' my right' to do this, have that, etc.Rights are the basis of governance in the U.S. I blame that approach to governance for the incivility and the loathing to take other people into account that in my observation pervade this nation these days.Turning to mutual respectDon't get me wrong. I love liberty. I very much doubt anyone could love it more than I do.There is a better way, however, to achieve liberty. That way is mutual respect. As a practical matter, mutual respect would maximize the liberty that co-existing people can enjoy simultaneously. "Practical" liberty is (as opposed to some idealized, hypothetical concept) 'real liberty', the liberty we experience in our day-to-day lives.At bottom, "respect" in this context simply means taking other people into account. As an ethic it can operate on the personal level, in business, for the structure and overall functioning of the economy, and for the political process itself.[Readers should note that having the economy be passively governed by mutual respect would relieve it of being actively governed, as it is at present, by government and a quasi-governmental central bank.]Mutual respect has a history in Western philosophy, too. It is present in the moral philosophies of both Immanuel Kant and G.W.F. Hegel (ranked one and two, in one order or the other, on most people's lists of 'greatest Modern philosophers'). It is also present in utilitarianism.For that matter, any philosophy that includes, explicitly or implicitly, a belief in human equality includes a presumption of mutual respect. Adopting mutual respect for governing governance does not depend on that or any other belief, but a belief in equality does bring a requirement of mutual respect with it.Back to Locke for mutual respectThe mutual respect implicit in a belief in equality is manifested in Locke's thought as equal respect for people's Natural Rights. When Locke used a dialectical argument to make liberty the predicate of justice he was standing right in front of mutual respect, but was facing the wrong way, as it were.Recall that he defined injustice as being subject to the arbitrary of any other person. The opposite of being in that condition is justice. Since the opposite of being subject to the arbitrary will of anyone else is at the same time being at liberty, Locke surmised that justice is liberty.On the other hand, there is a conclusion to be reached from Locke's starting point that is every bit as logical as the one Locke made. Philosophically, this conclusion beats his because it is more immediate, it raises no contradictions, and it does not result in a predicate of justice that itself must be constrained to prevent rule by the most ruthless. Practically, unlike equality per se and unconstrained liberty, taking this route to justice can efficaciously achieve just governance of both the economy and the political process while maximizing liberty.[The most focused readers will have noticed that Locke's definition of injustice must itself be substantiated, but we can leave that for another day. Besides, I've never seen it disputed except, indirectly, by Frederick Nietzsche and Ayn Rand in their hyper-romantic mode.]Here it is: if injustice is being subject to the arbitrary will of any other person, then justice requires that everyone refrain from subjecting any other person to one's own arbitrary will.When people are doing that, justice is the result. No constraints on such behavior are needed.To refrain from arbitrarily subjecting other people to one's will is to take other people into account. To take other people into account is to respect them. So, most simply the predicate of justice is mutual respect.ClosingAs I said at the beginning of this little essay, using mutual respect to govern governance would maximize practical liberty, reinforce political democracy, and retain the definitive institutions of the market-based economy. Applying it to the economy would allow us to eliminate unemployment, poverty, taxes, and public debt while passively enhancing our chances for environmental sustainability. It would also provide a universal ethic to govern personal interactions and the conduct of business.How all of that follows from recognizing mutual respect as the predicate of justice is not all that difficult or complicated, but it is more than can be addressed in one essay.

 11/09/2016 E! ONLINE Lady Gaga took to Trump Tower early Wednesday morning to protest the results of the U.S. election. The Bad Romance singer, a well-known Hillary Clinton supporter, stood outside Donald Trump s building and held a sign that read Love trumps hate. As the hours passed Tuesday night and it became clearer that Trump would win the presidency, Gaga tweeted, In a room full of hope, we will be heard. Stand up for kindness, equality, and love. Nothing will stop us. Say a prayer America. Gaga campaigned for Clinton earlier this week, attending a rally where she spoke of Clintons strengths. She has a career in politics that spans decades of experience, education, leadership, and wisdom. Shes ready to be president, she said. She kept going and she kept fighting for womens rights. She kept fighting for the care of our children. She kept fighting for those that are in need.Trumps victory was declared around 2:30 a.m. ET, and during his speech he praised Clintons efforts throughout the election. He said she was owed a deep debt of gratitude for all her hard work. We will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will deal fairly with everyone. We will seek common ground, partnership not conflict, he added in his speech. America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our destiny.
 11/06/2016 TRACY TWYMAN I put some of this information in an article I published yesterday morning about a larger subject. Today I have decided to isolate these segments and add more for a comprehensive piece on the subject because other relevant information has emerged. People in the FBI think Hillary Clinton is the Anti-Christ . They are close. She is the Whore of Babylon. Hillary was born in 1948, supposedly. I looked for this information on a hunch, after noticing several clues. And sure enough, back in 2008, someone on David Ickes forum speculated that Hillary may have been the Moonchild that, according to artist Marjorie Cameron , was implanted into her own womb by rocket scientist, occultist, and Crowley associate Jack Parsons during a ritual called the  Babalon Working . The purpose was to birth a child to be an incarnation of what Crowley called  Babalon , the Scarlet Whore with the cup of blood foretold in St. Johns Revelation that rides the Beast. Cameron actually claimed that this fetus, after being taken from her womb, was delivered to people involved in the militarys nuclear weapons progranm, who were apparently in cahoots with Parsons, and placed inside of a nuclear bomb that was tested. But the fetus survived, she said, because it had been placed inside of a special canister made exactly for this purpose. For the 1945 Trinity bomb test they made a special canister called Jumbo that was supposed to to preserve the plutonium if the bomb did failed to go off. They reportedly didnt end up using it for that, but it has been suggested that this is what preserved the fetus of the Moonchild. Presumably, it grew up to be somebody. Crowley named one of his female consorts (who he always called his Scarlet Women) Hilarion. Her name was Jeanne Foster. Crowleys attempt to conceive an heir as a magical child with Hilarion resulted, supposedly, in the childs spirit being attached to his protege Charles Stanfield Jones back in 1909. The attachment allegedly occurred when Jones went through the ritual for Crossing the Abyss in the 11th degree of the O.T.O., which involves being ritually sodomized by everyone in the group. Jack Parsons, another person who had willingly subjected himself to this ritual, channeled The Book of the Antichrist in 1949, where he foretold: And within seven years of this time, BABALON, THE SCARLET WOMAN HILARION will manifest among ye, and bring this my work to its fruition. I also believe that Hillary, with her notorious cracking voice, and possibly her rival Trump, were foretold in another document channeled by Parsons, the Book of Babalon : Her voice is sure as the judgement trump to crack the house of wrong, Though walls are high and stone is hard and the rule of hell was long The gates shall fall and the irons break in the Birth of BABALON. In Rome the Hilaria was a festival to the goddess Cybele (worshipped in the form of a black meteorite stone) to celebrate the resurrection of her son, who, as the legend states, she had been having sex with. She then became jealous of his love of others, castrated him, and let him die of bleeding (the reason why all of her priests, the Galli, were castrated, and actually considered women). She later regretted this and caused him to be brought back to life, then forced everyone under her rule to celebrate by laughing and partying joyously, as commemorated in this festival. Consider this next time you notice Hillary Clinton laughing inappropriately. Also note that Hillary Clinton has made several self-depricating jokes about herself being  not even human  and short-circuiting when she gets herself twisted up in her own lies. Specifically, in October 2015, when her interviewer at Buzzfeed noted that she seemed to not be sweating, even though it was a hot day (odd, because Hillary has notoriously bad B.O.), she asked Hillary what kind of deodorant she used. Clintons reply was astounding. You guys are the first to realize that Im really not even a human being. I was constructed in a garage in Palo Alto a very long time ago  I mean, a man whose name shall remain nameless created me in his garage. Palo Alto is the location of Stanford University, Jack Parsons Alma Mater.

 Crazy conspiracy theories dominate the final days before Nov. 8 Share This FBI Director James Comeys decision to reopen the investigation into Hillary Clintons mishandling of classified information has the Clintonites falling back on their tried-and-true response to all the revelations coming from WikiLeaks and other sources  its all a Russian plot. Except, this time, the hysteria has reached such a fever pitch, and the conspiracy theories are so unhinged, that the political discourse in this country will be poisoned for years to come. It started with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who told CNNs Wolf Blitzer: So the question is: Where did these [emails] come from? How did they get to the FBI? Is Russia involved in this? We dont have a clue where this stuff is coming from. We dont know if Ryan was drunk ( again ) when he said this, but his nickname of  Congressman Moonbeam  seems well-earned, and the implication of his remarks  that the FBI is in league with the Russians  underscores his marginality. However, it wasnt long before the marginal started merging with the mainstream. In tandem with Rya, Howard Dean, former presidential candidate and once head of the Democratic party, tweeted : Ironically, Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. Now Dean may be a bit more credible than Ryan, but who can forget the  Dean scream  that dramatized his loonier side, and effectively knocked him out of contention for the Democratic presidential nomination? And then there were those payments from the Mujahideen-e-Khalq , a nutty Marxist-Islamist cult, in return for serving as their front man. And so while Dean may be better known, what hes know for isnt exactly adding to his credibility, and so we can safely relegate this kind of conspiracy theorizing to the fringes of the Democratic party spectrum. Right? Wrong. Here is longtime Clintonite strategist James Carville opining that Its unprecedented   the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy. Well, okay, who listens to Carville, anyway? Hes so yester day! Well, then, get a load of Harry Reid, who leads the Senates Democrats, repeating a different version of the same nonsense in a letter to Comey : "In my communications with you and other top officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government  a foreign interest hostile to the united states, which Trump praises at every opportunity. The public has a right to know this information. I wrote to you months ago calling for this information to be released to the public. There is no danger to American interests from releasing it. And yet, you continue to resist calls to inform the public of this critical information." Its so explosive that it exploded into utter nothingness, according to the New York Times this [Tuesday] morning: For much of the summer, the F.B.I. pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign. Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead  which they ultimately came to doubt  about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank. Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, FBI and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump. As Gertrude Stein once put it, Theres no there there. She was talking about Oakland, California, but might just as well have been describing the inside of Harrys brain. And, yes, you read the above cited Times story right: instead of going after terrorists, or ordinary criminals, for months the FBI has been chasing down rabbit holes looking for Trumps alleged links to the nonexistent International Kremlin/Alt-Right/Putinist Conspiracy. We have returned to the halcyon days of J. Edgar Hoover, when people were investigated and harassed for their political views at the instigation of their ideological opponents. Oh, but the FBI was too  overburdened and undermanned  to keep Omar Mateen on their radar. In this election, the tragic and the comic mix and merge, but surely the former is dominant in the latest of Franklin Foers Russophobic effusions. Formerly the editor of The New Republic , who was unceremoniously dumped by its new owner, Foer has teamed up with the Clinton campaign as its unofficial conspiracy theorist, spinning tales of Trumps links to the Russians. Hes the Alex Jones of the Clinton crowd, except that not even Jones would be caught dead promoting the kind of incoherent nonsense in Foers latest screed . According to Foer, Trump has a secret server set up specifically to communicate with his Kremlin Masters. We know this because a computer scientist who wants to be known only as Tea Leaves, and other experts  who also dont want to tell us their names  have supposedly discovered this Secret Link. The server connects to the Alfa Bank, which is located in  cue in scary music  Russia! And guess what!? This closed communication link was especially active during politically sensitive times! This, according to Foer and his anonymous band of experts, is conclusive proof that The Donald is a secret agent of the KGB, intent on polluting our precious bodily fluids with icky Russian cooties. The only problem with this wacky conspiracy theory is that theres a prosaic explanation for the existence of this suspicious online traffic: the Trump Organization had hired a company to send out ads for their hotels. The online traffic to Alfa Bank meant only that several employees of that bank had stayed in Trumps hotels and were being solicited to do so again. And in spite of the scientific-looking chart displayed in the Foer piece, in fact the online traffic to and from Alfa didnt peak when the US political scene got hot: Thats wrong, writes Timothy B. Lee in the anti-Trump pro-Hillary Vox.com. If anything, the chart shows the opposite of that. As Lee puts it:  Foer claims that the pattern of traffic between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank servers is highly unusual  so unusual that it can best be explained as a secretive communication link between Donald Trump and the Kremlin. But in this case, there seems to be a plausible and perfectly innocent explanation for the traffic pattern suggested by an IT consultant named Naadir Jeewa and endorsed by security expert Robert Graham : The Trump organization is sending out promotional emails about Trump hotels, and one or more Alfa Bank employees is on the recipient list. This is actually the explanation thats suggested by Occams razor because  as Foer himself acknowledges in his story  the server was originally registered by an email marketing firm called Cendyn. The Trump organization seems to have hired Cendyn to send out emails promoting Trumps hotels, a service Cendyn has been providing since the Trump server was registered in 2009. So the most obvious explanation for the traffic is that Cendyn is using its server for its intended purpose. When Hillary Clintons Twitter account tweeted Foers farrago and declared Its time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia, cyber-security expert Robert Graham replied on his blog : This is nonsense. The evidence available on the Internet is that Trump neither (directly) controls the domain "trump-email.com," nor has access to the server. Instead, the domain was setup and controlled by Cendyn, a company that does marketing/promotions for hotels, including many of Trumps hotels. Cendyn outsources the email portions of its campaigns to a company called Listrak, which actually owns/operates the physical server in a data center in Philadelphia. So the server wasnt even owned by the Trump Organization . And yet it took the FBI months, and journalists, including even The Intercept , weeks to conclude that this story is completely bogus. The US taxpayers should demand their money back  not to mention Pierre Omidyar . Even after this sloppy McCarthyite smear was debunked, the Clinton campaign breathlessly repeated the charges: This secret hotline may be the key to unlocking the mystery of Trumps ties to Russia! What this perfervid fantasy is the actually key to is the hysterical desperation of the Clinton campaign as it is engulfed in daily scandals that threaten to sink it beneath the electoral waves. Are you laughing  or crying  yet? Oh, but Im not done! If you think this grade-B conspiracy theory is the lowest form of electoral entertainment, then you obviously havent read David Corns latest entry into the Smear Trump Sweepstakes. Glenn Greenwald  no friend of Trumps  describes it as an unnamed person, from an unknown country, who used to work in an unnamed agency, claims Trump is a Russian agent. How did the real estate mogul become a tool of the Kremlin? Well, you see, Trump once traveled to Russia, where he was suborned by one of those slinky-looking Russian ladies and Russian intelligence had compromised Trump during his visits to Moscow and could blackmail him. Yes, theyre blackmailing Trump over a sexual indiscretion  because that would destroy him for sure ! And its all in a secret memo that only Corn, the editors of Mother Jones , and their Mysterious Veteran Spook have seen. On one level, this is hysterically funny; its grade-C thriller material that is likely to be found at the bottom of some publishers slush pile. On another level  the political level  it is immensely depressingly significant  because these people are liberals, even leftists. They arent stupid: they know the ignominious history of witch-hunting in this country. Id call this McCarthyism  but even Joe McCarthy had some actual evidence to back up his claims of foreign agents lurking in the corridors of power. Corn, Foer, and the Clinton campaign are simply retailing lies. Whats depressing about this is the fact that, if Hillary wins, it isnt going to stop. Far from it: the new red scare will accelerate, as her political enemies are tarred with the KGB agent brush. And when the notoriously vindictive Democratic candidate takes revenge not only on her domestic political enemies, but on the Russians, an ugly  and dangerous  confrontation is in the cards. Shell sic the FBI on Trumps supporters, and Trump himself, and shell unleash the US military and our allies on Putin  and then, watch out. That American liberalism has degenerated into a Russophobic, warmongering, witch-hunting ideology so quickly is one of the most astonishing ideological transformations in our political history. And all in the name of garnering partisan political advantage. As Donald Trump would put it: Sad! You can buy An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard (Prometheus Books, 2000), my biography of the great libertarian thinker, here . Read more by 
Email The excitement over the US election is culminating as the due date is getting closer. Each candidate is trying to use any device at hand to denigrate the other and morality is the last thing to strike the minds of the candidates. The fact of the matter is that morality is a dead circle in the American politics. Hillary Clinton, the democratic candidate, uses f-word in a debate ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/did-hillary-clinton-mutter-donald-trump-debate.html ) watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world and finds no shame in it. Even American religious leaders believe that Clinton is not competent to be the president of a religious country like United States ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/christian-right-leader-hillary-clinton-hostile-biblical-christianity.html ). On the other hand, the GOP candidate, Donald trump , has no better condition. His sexual harassments and violent ideas towards women were shocking not only for female victims, but also for the dominant male group in America. The violent use of words to address different groups of people, mainly in social media ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/as-first-lady-melania-trump-wants-to-save-you-from-her-husband.html ) , made it hard for the parents to allow their kids to follow him. Besides, the number of women that accused Trump of groping and rape ( http://en.institutomanquehue.org/publications/news/list-women-accused-donald-trump-of-sexual-assault.html ) is increasing day by day and the list is running on. The so-called locker-room video of Trump talking dirty about women and his attitude towards them leaked to the public to be the final shot on the republican candidate, but it did not have that much affect. It seems that even grabbing the women by the p y could not change their idea about Trump. All these information, some released by the opponent candidate and some by other sources mainly WikiLeaks, seems to have had little significance in the public orientation in choosing a candidate. This has less to do with the people than with the administration system and media empire in the United States. The fact that Trump does not talk about a rigged-election for respecting democracy and exercising the law is clear as a truth. His words that I will accept the result of the election if I were chosen is more like a joke than the words of a would-be president. What Assange is trying to say in his tweet is that the rig is being done on a higher level than the polls or the voting system. The whole administration and political system is rigged in America and the people will not choose a candidate; they are chosen to choose. This is the truth behind the weird public orientation towards election in spite of all the information released about the corruptions of the two candidates in mass media. The fact that the media and the political system are rigging the election in a latent mode is the key to the question raised about the mysteries of the American election.
(Before It's News)By Michael Synder Is the 2016 election in the process of being stolen? Just a few weeks ago I issued a major alert warning that this exact sort of thing might happen. Early voting has already begun in many states, and a number of voters in Texas are reporting that the voting machines switched their votes from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. The odd thing is that none of the other choices were affected when these individuals attempted to vote for a straight Republican ticket. If Hillary Clinton is declared the winner of the state of Texas on election night, a full investigation of these voting machines should be conducted, because there is no way that Donald Trump should lose that state. I have said that it will be the greatest miracle in U.S. political history if Donald Trump wins this election, but without the state of Texas Donald Trump has exactly zero chance of winning. So those living down in Texas need to keep reporting anything unusual that they see or hear when they go to vote.Most Americans dont realize this, but the exact same thing was happening during the last presidential election. The state of Ohio was considered to be the key to Mitt Romneys chances of winning in 2012, and right up to election day the Romney campaign actually believed that they were going to win the state.Unfortunately for Romney, something funny was going on with the voting machines. In a previous article , I included a Quote: from an Ohio voter that had her vote switched from Mitt Romney to Barack Obama three times  I dont know if it happened to anybody else or not, but this is the first time in all the years that we voted that this has ever happened to me, said Marion, Ohio, voter Joan Stevens.Stevens said that when she voted, it took her three tries before the machine accepted her choice to vote for Romney .I went to vote and I got right in the middle of Romneys name, Stevens told Fox News, saying that she was certain to put her finger directly on her choice for the White House.She said that the first time she pushed Romney, the machine marked Obama.So she pushed Romney again. Obama came up again. Then it happened a third time.Maybe you make a mistake once, but not three times, she told Fox News.And we did see some very, very strange numbers come out of certain areas of Ohio four years ago.For example, there were more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County in which Barack Obama got at least 99 percent of the vote in 2012.If that happened in just one precinct that would be odd enough. But the odds of it happening in more than 100 precincts in just one county by random chance are so low that they arent even worth mentioning.And of course this didnt just happen in Ohio. Similar things were happening all over the country .The reason why I bring all of this up is to show that there is a pattern. If a fair vote had been conducted, Romney may have indeed won in 2012, and now it appears that voting machines are being rigged again.In Wichita County, Texas so many people were reporting that their votes were being switched from Trump to Clinton that it made the local newspaper  Shortly after early voting booths opened Monday in Wichita County, rumors swirled online about possible errors in the process. Several online posts claimed a friend or family member had attempted to vote straight party Republican ticket, but their presidential nomination was switched to the Democratic nominee, Hilary Clinton. None of the local reports were from people who experienced the situation first hand. A Bowie woman posted that a relative who lives in Arlington saw her votes switched. The post was shared more than 100,000 times Monday.And Paul Joseph Watson has written about some specific individuals that are making allegations that their votes for president were switched by the machines. One of the examples that he cited was a Facebook post by Lisa Houlette of Amarillo, Texas  Gary and I went to early vote today I voted a straight Republican ticket and as I scrolled to submit my ballot I noticed that the Republican Straight ticket was highlighted, however, the clinton/kaine box was also highlighted! I tried to go back and change and could not get it to work. I asked for help from one of the workers and she couldnt get it to go back either. It took a second election person to get the machine to where I could correct the vote to a straight ticket. Be careful and double check your selections before you cast your vote! Dont hesitate to ask for help. I had to have help to get mine changed.I dont know about you, but major alarm bells went off in my head when I read that.A similar incident was reported on Facebook by Shandy Clark of Arlington, Texas  Hey everyone, just a heads up! I had a family member that voted this morning and she voted straight Republican. She checked before she submitted and the vote had changed to Clinton! She reported it and made sure her vote was changed back. They commented that It had been happening. She is trying to get the word out and asked that we post and share. Just want everyones vote to be accurate and count. Check your vote before you submit!And of course they werent the only ones reporting vote switching. It turns out that lots of other Texans have also experienced this phenomenon  So is there a serious problem with the voting machines?According to Breitbart , one county in Texas has already removed all electronic voting machines and has made an emergency switch to paper ballots Chambers County election officials have executed an emergency protocol to remove all electronic voting machines available during early voting until a software update can be completed to correct problems experienced by straight-ticket voters .Chambers County Clerk Heather Hawthorne told Breitbart Texas Tuesday morning that all electronic voting was temporarily halted until her office completes a software update on ES&S machines that otherwise omit one race when a straight ticket option is selected for either major party. The Texas 14 th Court of Appeals race was reported to be the contest in which voters commonly experienced the glitch.Lets keep a very close eye on this. If the state of Texas ends up in Trumps column on election night, perhaps no harm has been done.But if Trump loses Texas there is no possible way that he will be able to make up those 38 electoral votes somewhere else.Despite what the mainstream media is saying, the truth is that election fraud is very real. Just the other day, WND published an article that contained a list of documented cases of election fraud in 23 different states . And Devvy Kidd just authored a piece that pointed out that there are 24 million voter registrations in this country that are  no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate  In 2012 the highly respected Pew Research Center exposed the sickening state of voter rolls in this country:Nearly 2 million deceased registered to voteClose to 3 million registered in multiples statesApproximately 24 millionone of every eightvoter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurateMore than 1.8 million deceased individuals are listed as votersApproximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one stateBut despite everything you just read, the mainstream media is trying very hard to prop up faith in the integrity of the process. In fact, just today CNN came out with an article entitled  Poll: Most see a Hillary Clinton victory and a fair count ahead  Almost 7 in 10 voters nationwide say they think Hillary Clinton will win the presidency next month, but most say that if that happens, Donald Trump will not accept the results and concede, according to a new CNN/ORC poll.Americans overall are more confident that the nations votes for president will be cast and counted accurately this year than they were in 2008. Whatever the outcome, however, nearly 8 in 10 say that once all the states have certified their vote counts, the losing candidate has an obligation to accept the results and concede to the winner.Unfortunately, CNN does not have much credibility left at this point, and it is getting harder and harder to believe the polls that are being put out by the mainstream media.And the mainstream media would also have us believe that if evidence of election fraud does emerge that it will be because the Russians have made it up  U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials are warning that hackers with ties to Russias intelligence services could try to undermine the credibility of the presidential election by posting documents online purporting to show evidence of voter fraud.The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said however, that the U.S. election system is so large, diffuse and antiquated that hackers would not be able to change the outcome of the Nov. 8 election.But hackers could post documents, some of which might be falsified, that are designed to create public perceptions of widespread voter fraud, the officials said.Now that is a real conspiracy theory, and it would be incredibly funny if all of this wasnt so serious.During this election season, if you see or hear anything unusual about voting in your area, please report it.The American people should be allowed to make a free and fair choice, and anyone that attempts to alter an election is committing a crime against all of us.And lets watch the state of Texas very carefully. If it goes blue, you will know that something has gone terribly, terribly wrong.http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/it-is-happening-again-voting-machines-are-switching-votes-from-donald-trump-to-hillary-clinton
News, information and analysis from the black left.  Submitted by Nellie Bailey a... on Mon, 10/31/2016 - 20:45 Venezuela The Missing Black Movement Ingredient: Self-Determination The Black Is Back Coalition for Social Justice, Peace and Reparations will hold a National Black Political Convention on Self-Determination, November 5 and 6, in Washington, DC. If you go through history, the fundamental thing that weve confronted is the loss of our self-determination as a people, said Black Is Back chairman Omali Yeshitela . The Coalition has put forward a 19-point position on the need to put self-determination at the center of Black struggles. The 19 points give us the beginning of some kind of a plan, said Yeshitela. It says, specifically, here is our view on self-determination and the subject of reparations, Black women, the question of police invasion and brutality in our community, and many other issues. The Moment of Truth for the Empire We are entering a new moment in American history, said Dr. Anthony Monteiro , the Duboisian scholar and Black Radical Organizing Committee activist. It is a moment of truth for the ruling class, for the ruling elite. What do they do when they are trumped at home -- forgive the pun -- and trumped internationally? he asked. Do they back off of empire, do they readjust, do they become peaceful, or do they up the stakes and attempt to resolve all problems with war abroad and oppression at home? Dr. Monteiro is one of the planners of a Revolutionary Science for Radical Times conference, in Philadelphia, December 9 and 10. Hard Times in Venezuela Despite what the corporate media are telling you, Venezuelans are not starving and the Socialist Party government will not be toppled any time soon. However, the rightwing opposition is smelling blood due to an economic crisis that has made it very difficult for people to get access to imported goods, and many goods are very expensive, said political science professor George Caccariello-Maher , of Drexel University, author of We Created Chavez: A Peoples History of the Venezuelan Revolution . Corruption, smuggling and money speculation are serious problems, said Caccariello-Maher. However, the strength of the Left lies in the nations grassroots organizations and communes. It would be very difficult for an opposition government to come in and attempt to throw them off their land or return property to the private sector, he said. Happy Birthday, Rev. Pinkney! Benton Harbor, Michigan, human rights leader Rev. Edward Pinkney, currently serving a 2   to 10 year sentence on election tampering charges, turned 68 years old this month. Marcina Cole , a courtroom observer at Pinkneys trial, teamed up with David Sole , of the Michigan Emergency Committee Against War and Injustice, to throw a birthday party for Pinkney, in absentia, in Detroit. Hes definitely in support of other inmates, doing ministry work, and looking forward to being out very soon, said Cole. She reported that Green Party vice presidential candidate Ajamu Baraka visited the political prisoner on October 19. This was historical, said Cole. They know how powerful Rev. Pinkney is -- and that he has allies on the outside. Black Agenda Radio on the Progressive Radio Network is hosted by Glen Ford and Nellie Bailey.

   Robert Parry, Consortium News The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the worlds gold standard that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The wise men of the system simply insist otherwise. We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nations leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized.Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldnt vote). That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners. Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century. Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks. Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedys vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the Souths heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners. However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixons Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. Nixons Treason So, by 1968, the Democrats once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didnt want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that  with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided  President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam. The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixons campaign went behind Johnsons back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnsons Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixons emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam. Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixons treason from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election  he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford  three pillars of the Establishment  expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking: Some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that Im wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected, Clifford said. It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our countrys interests. Cliffords words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of Americas electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process. To this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixons treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the librarys archivists call the file on Nixons sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their X-file. [For details, see Consortiumnews.coms  LBJs X-File on Nixons Treason. ] The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixons paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his treason top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJs presidency  led to Nixons creation of the plumbers, a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the plumbers became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committees headquarters at the Watergate in Washington. Although the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixons far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnsons Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixons sabotage  and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome  the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.coms  The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .] In effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixons strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting presidents foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign. Reagans October Surprise Caper In that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reagans campaign feared that Carter might pull off an October Surprise by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reagans team take action to block Carters October Surprise? The testimonial and documentary evidence that Reagans team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carters October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixons Paris peace talk maneuver. That evidence indicates that Reagans campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reagans vice presidential running mate. By early November 1980, the publics obsession with Irans humiliation of the United States and Carters inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reagans inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan. Bolstered by his image as a tough guy, Reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle Class. Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Irans cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration. In summer 1981, when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a PBS interview: It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment.   [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time. Those early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reagans beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaraguas leftist government. While many facts of the Iran-Contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the Reagan-Iran relationship was always kept hazy. The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go there. A half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-President George H.W. Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. In other words, Bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt. Tired of the Story By the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 October Surprise question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991. However, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israels exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 October Surprise case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Caseys attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages. Although the bogus Newsweek/New Republic London alibi would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the Presidents flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation. Meanwhile, Bushs State Department and White House counsels office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena. Years later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassys confirmation of Caseys trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape. Williamson said that among the State Department material potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was] a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown, Beach noted in a  memorandum for record  dated Nov. 4, 1991. Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beachs boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bushs reelection hopes in 1992. At the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bushs reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to kill/spike this story. Gray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. Whatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate October Surprise investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President , Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.] Among touchstones cited by Gray were No Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan. White House talking points on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings. Timid Democrats But Bushs White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received  and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993  there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagans election victory. That would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process  and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be good for the country. In 2014 when I sent a copy of Beachs memo regarding Caseys trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task forces dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue. The [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the trip to Madrid, Hamilton told me. Should they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that. Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task forces dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task forces investigation. If the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us, Hamilton said, adding that you have to rely on people in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquirys failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was nave in the extreme. Arguably, Hamiltons timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bushs team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamiltons investigative conclusion reinforced the group think dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a conspiracy theory when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasnt done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent. Still, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didnt make any sense . But the dismissive group think remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned. [For details, see Robert Parrys Americas Stolen Narrative or Trick or Treason: The 1980 October Surprise Mystery or Consortiumnews.coms  Second Thoughts on October Surprise. ] Past as Prologue Lee Hamiltons decision to clear Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bushs rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000. President George W. Bush is introduced by his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before delivering remarks at Sun City Center, Florida, on May 9, 2006. (White House photo by Eric Draper), if the full truth had been told about the fathers role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, its hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush stolen election in 2000. Regarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Floridas electoral votes and thus the presidency. The reality of Gores rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Floridas disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted. However, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be good for the country. So, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery  that the so-called over-votes in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the under-votes that hadnt registered on antiquated voting machines. Over-votes would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on clear intent of the voter. However, instead of leading with Gores rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred. On Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Gores victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for the good of the country, much as Johnsons team had done in 1968 regarding Nixons sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamiltons inquiry had done regarding the 1980 October Surprise case. Within a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didnt accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom. However, this violation of objective and professional journalism  bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle  was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future. By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000  even if the medias motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks  the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.coms  Gores Victory , So Bush Did Steal the White House , and  Bush v. Gores Dark American Decade. ] A Phalanx of Misguided Consensus Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the stolen elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful losers are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters will had been ignored or twisted. Al Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Courts majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bushs legitimacy. Similarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern wise man, in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didnt ruffle too many feathers. But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies  uttered for the good of the country is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest. So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isnt pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. Trumps complaints about rigged elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they dont succeed at stealing the election from white people. There is a racist undertone to Trumps version of a rigged democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. Hes just not honest about what those flaws are. The hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracys gold standard; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.

   Source: Truth Out The US corporate media never fail to report on Russian opportunism and its atrocities in various world conflicts. Objectively speaking, Putin's actions are not that different from Obama's, but Americans tend to see their presidents as benevolent. President Obama during a bilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the opening day of the United Nations General Assembly, on September 28, 2015. (Photo: Doug Mills / The New York Times) There is a dangerous leader heading an irrational state who is deploying forces to Syria he insists are fighting terrorists. His decisions have led to numerous civilian casualties and the threatening of nuclear confrontation with his nation's ideological foe. Domestically, his administration has jailed journalists and silenced critics in government , and since WWII, his country's intelligence services have meddled in the elections of dozens of countries and are now contemplating a cyberattack on its hegemonic rival. His administration maintains alliances with corrupt juntas and religious fundamentalists while championing domestic and foreign policies that have done little to rein in the country's violent nationalism, intolerant nativism, police brutality and enriching of the few at the expense of the many. His name is Barack Obama. One could certainly be forgiven in thinking it was Vladimir Putin, since his justifications for Russian policy are strikingly similar. While the US corporate media frantically reports on Russia's actions in Ukraine and Syria, it appears content with the havoc wreaked by its Nobel Peace Prize president in sundry countries across three continents. For well-established reasons rooted in exceptionalism and indoctrination, the US mainstream media cannot refer to Obama and his administration in the same terms used to describe Putin. Whereas The New Yorker can run a headline that states, " Putin, Syria, and Why Moscow Has Gone War Crazy ," it is unfathomable to think of the US press referring to the Obama administration's policies in similar language. In fact, the article's author, Joshua Jaffe, appears bewildered with Russia's policies in the Middle East and Europe, especially the Russian Defence Ministry's announcement on October 8 that it had deployed nuclear warheads to Kaliningrad. The fact that Kaliningrad is part of Russia aside, Jaffe writes that, "Projecting a half-lunatic readiness to blow up the world is, in essence, a cover operation: a way to make a lot of noise while the Kremlin goes about creating a lot of new facts on the ground, whether in Syria or the Baltics." If this Russian move is irrational, wouldn't Obama's actions -- supporting ill-defined rebel groups in Syria, signature strikes in Pakistan and indiscriminate Saudi bombing in Yemen -- be irrational as well? And in any state where the press was doing its job, wouldn't a look at US nuclear policy -- by sheer quantity of warheads, one that could be categorized as "readiness to blow up the world" -- and its citizens' attitudes toward weapons of mass destruction be prudent? It is unlikely that such a critical look will come anytime soon from the submissive US mainstream media, however. Though much has been written about Putin's clampdown and control of the Russian press, corporate US media outlets are hamstrung by the monopoly that six corporations have on the American "marketplace of ideas." This is not to exonerate or extoll Putin. On the contrary, Putin is an opportunist bent on increasing his power and influence. But so is Obama and any other (future) US president, be it Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. One can only dream that the same measures that the US press takes in detailing Russian atrocities in Syria could be applied to US atrocities there, and also in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Yemen and Somalia. But the US corporate media and populace seem to believe that Russia's intentions are malicious, while the United States' intentions are benevolent. This why US bombings of civilians in Syria are described as "mistakes," whereas the aim of Russian bombing can only be "terror." For example, the bombing of a UN convoy in September that Russia says was accompanied by terrorist elements was reported in the US press as a targeted strike against civilians. Russia may very well target civilians. The tragedy of Aleppo is well-documented. The point here is not to justify Russian actions. It is to question why the US mainstream media accept the Obama administration's assertions that Russia's bombs are aimed at civilians, while US bombs are not. One could argue that both Russia and the US are guilty of civilian bombings, since distinctions between rebel, terrorist and civilian are blurred in civil war. But this would challenge the notion of benevolent intentions that are at the core of American exceptionalism. Interestingly, those who have bothered to look into Obama's abovementioned signature strikes will find that tolerance of civilian casualties is at the heart of that policy. And if a Martian -- bereft of any understanding of nationalism or exceptionalism, but well-versed in international Human Rights Law -- were to take a cursory look at the last 50 years of US foreign policy, he might conclude that the US does, in fact, target civilians . A cynic would claim that the truth here does not matter. It is what people believe to be the truth that reigns supreme. To this end, both the American and Russian mainstream media and governments are presenting a one-sided version of atrocities that aims to vilify the other. To address this dangerous trend, I presented a paper at Penza University in southern Russia on October 12, examining the language the Western media use to castigate and dehumanize Putin. The paper, " Language as a Weapon: How Western Journalists Portray Russian Policy ,"was given at a conference titled, "Language. Law. Society." After completing my talk, I fielded a question from a Russian academic regarding the role of the US as a world police force. This is a common question in the former Soviet Union and is trumpeted in the Russian press. My answer was that the US would never be a world police force, as it intervenes only in those areas where its vital economic interests are at stake. The main point being that the US corporate media do not accurately describe these interventions as power moves that waste large amounts of civilian life. Instead, the corporate media too often act as a public relations firm for the US government, repeating hollow rhetoric about freedom, liberty, democracy and the open market. The man responded that I should move to Russia, since the Russian press also make similar hollow claims in support of Putin. Nobody would argue that Putin does not control the Russian media, and that his distorted version of the truth prevails. But one should question why, in a "free" society like the US, Obama's distorted version does, too. Share This Article...
Hemp has been making a lot of noise lately, especially with the growing awareness surrounding the use of hemp oil for treating cancer. Although the word hemp still often gets confused and lumped into the same definition as Cannabis, a similar but psychoactive plant, its important to realize hemp can be a major game changer for our world if used to its potential. As we go through this post, you will be wondering why dont we use this stuff all the time.. for everything?! Simple answer, farming hemp was banned in the US and other countries in the 1937 because of the threat it caused to certain companies and their businesses. More about that here.   Although hemp has many practical uses , lets focus on one that would affect us every day; clothing. For this, we will compare hemp to cotton, as cotton is a very popular resource used in clothing production. Well need to focus on various areas that have to be taken into consideration when comparing the two so we can determine not only what is better for us, but also what is best for our environment as its important to view things holistically. Lets do it. Water Cotton : To grow cotton you require about 1400 gallons of water for every pound you intend to produce. Thats a lot of water! Some areas of the world that produce cotton are running out of fresh water due to the production of cotton as well as clothing. Some areas of the world have even experienced desertification as a result of producing cotton. Hemp : You require about half the amount of water to produce hemp as you would if producing cotton. Hemp is a strong and reliable plant that grows very quickly. Not only that, hemp produces about 200%  250% more fibre in the same amount of land compared to cotton. The victor: Hemp Pesticides Cotton : One of the biggest downsides to cotton is how much pesticides are used to grow the plant. Although organic cotton farming is beginning to catch on a bit more, the production of cotton worldwide takes up about 25% of the worlds pesticide use. The other unfortunate factor is that these chemicals can end up being absorbed into our skin as we wear clothing.   Hemp : The beauty of hemp is that it requires no pesticides to grow. In fact, it doesnt require any chemicals at all to grow. The growing nature of the plant competes with weeds and over-powers their ability to sustain themselves. This allows the hemp plant to grow freely and quickly. The victor: Hemp Comfort & Longevity Cotton : Generally very comfortable to begin with, as you continue to wear cotton it breaks in to become even more comfortable. There is no denying how soft cotton can be, but it is also true that cotton fibres break down over time and the more it is washed the faster it breaks down. Hemp : The hemp fibre used in clothing is a strong natural fibre that, like cotton, gets progressively softer with each passing day you wear it and each time you wash it. Although it may not start off quite as soft, it is still soft and certainly would not be considered uncomfortable. The plus is that the fibre is much stronger and durable. Repeated washed will not break the fibre down anywhere near as quickly as cotton. Creating more hemp clothing would mean we would need to produce much less clothing. The victor: Hemp B reathability & Wicking Cotton : Breathability is certainly a strong suit for cotton. It also does not hold odours for very much. This is quite possibly one of the biggest downsides to synthetic fibres, they dont dispel odour well and dont often deal with moisture well either. While cotton has a natural wicking system, it also holds moisture a little longer than what might be considered most desirable. Hemp : Performs very well when it comes to breathability and wicks moisture away from the body effectively. Hemp also carries anti-bacterial properties that trump any other natural fibre. This means hemp will not mold or grow mildew very easily. Since it also does not hold odours, hemp clothing edges out cotton slightly on this one The victor: Almost a tie, but hemp is our pal on this one again Aesthetics Cotton : Without the use of dyes, cotton comes naturally in white, cream and off-white. Cotton can be dyed naturally or synthetically to achieve a desired color. The growing knowledge that cotton is very taxing on the environment and not healthy for our skin is creating quite the demand for organic cotton. In terms of the fashion market, organic cotton is showing up more and more. Hemp : Given the various processes available to remove fibres from the stem of a hemp plant, hemp can be naturally creamy white, black, green, grey or brown. Without even requiring the use of dye, hemp comes in a variety of colors. Of course, you are still able to dye hemp both naturally and synthetically. Hemp is quickly becoming more and more popular in the fashion market as designers see the potential in the material while being a very environmentally sound option. Since it is durable and lasts a long time, it can be attractive to certain designers. The voctor: Hemp Final Decision Winner by knockout and growing undisputed champion of natural harmony, HEMP! This isnt to say that cotton, especially grown organically, is not a good material, it simply isnt better all around than hemp. In some cases, cotton could be a must use if something specific is being produced. The biggest differences are in the facts that hemp requires much less water and no pesticides to produce. Not only that, it boasts a lot more fibre per acre. Concerned about excess CO2 in the atmosphere? Hemp is spectacular at sequestering CO2! Take the time to check out some hemp clothing around the internet or see if there are some local stores who sell it. Although options can sometimes be limited right now, look out for more hemp clothing as awareness continues to spread!
BREAKING: Smoking Gun! Shock Clean Up Order White House Gave When Hillary Emails Broke Sept. 26, St. Peter, Minnesota As the first presidential debate was about to begin, a woman wearing Trump campaign apparel was assaulted on her way to a debate viewing event. Aug. 19, Minneapolis, Minnesota Trump supporters had to face an angry leftist mob when they were leaving a Trump fundraiser at the Minneapolis Convention Center. They were hit, pushed and spat on. Aug. 13, Oak Ridge, Tennessee Vester Bullock, a 68-year-old cancer survivor, was beaten at a garage sale because he wore a Trump pin on his hat. He was assaulted and punched so hard that he lost a tooth. Aug. 12, West Hollywood, California Two women assaulted pro-Trump activist Tim Treadstone after a Trump rally. They broke his phone, punched him and clawed at his face. They were formally charged with assault and battery. Around Aug. 12, West Hollywood, California On the night of a rally, Tim Treadstone and other Trump supporters were denied access at a popular Mexican restaurant. Other customers began throwing food and screaming at the group. During the rally, a can of Monster energy drink, eggs and dog feces were also thrown at pro-Trump demonstrators. Aug. 3, Bloomfield, New Jersey An assailant attacked a 62-year-old man wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt. The motorist inquired why (the man) was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him, a police spokesman stated. The (victim) continued to walk away as (the) motorist followed him. The motorist hit the man several times with a crowbar, causing injuries to his arms, hands, and thighs. June 18, Las Vegas, Nevada British national Michael Sandford , 19, tried to take a gun from a local police officer during a Trump rally. He was arrested and reportedly said he intended to use the gun to kill Trump. (The media had no choice but to report this one.) June 2, San Jose, California Rioters assaulted Trump rally attendees as they left the event while local policed just watched. Since then, 14 of those attacked have filed a class-action lawsuit against the city and Mayor Sam Liccardo. April 28, Costa Mesa, California Anti-Trump demonstrators threw rocks at moving cars. One bloodied the face of a Trump supporter who was driving away after the rally. March 12, Dayton, Ohio At the airport, Black Lives Matter supporter Thomas Dimassimo rushed the small stage when Trump was speaking. He was tackled by Secret Service agents before he could reach the GOP candidate and was later charged with disorderly conduct and inducing panic. Before the attack, he had tweeted: Ive had about all I can take from the violent trump ralliers. Saturday im (sic) going to check my people and spit on their false king. After his release from jail hours later, he tweeted: F*** you b**** @realDonaldTrump[.] The attack did receive widespread media attention. March 11, Chicago, Illinois Violent left-wing demonstrators forced a cancellation of Trumps rally then celebrated shutting it down, which led to the arrest of four people. This is by no means a complete list. Other stories continually show that Trump supporters  not Clinton supporters  have been repeatedly denied service, targeted and beaten, chased out of events, and insulted by being cornered and spit on. This is nobodys idea of tolerant.

 October 28, 2016 Many downwardly mobile Americans are confused about what happened to them, which explains the attraction of Donald Trump, who offers few coherent solutions but may have a lasting impact on U.S. relations with the world, says Michael Brenner. By Michael Brenner Donald Trump most likely will not be elected President. Still, his historic campaign has sent shock waves through the American body politic. All are asking what it means and what it portends. The focus is on America at home rather than abroad. Foreign policy issues have been overshadowed by anxious domestic concerns. Moreover, Trump never formulated a coherent view of international issues. Like the average guy, he simply spat out whatever thoughts passed through his head as he had caught snippets of Fox News. Any attempt to discern logic and strategy from Trumps disjointed exclamations proves frustrating. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Trumps entire campaign conveyed emotions rather than considered thoughts. It played to the publics feelings  amplifying them and channeling them into a turbid or opaque brew of primitive slogans. Energy was imparted through unbridled vehemence and the showmanship of the born despot. So it is those emotions that we should look at to see what is simmering behind the formal faade of our democracy in action. For they will outlast the election. Therein lies their significance for possible effects on the United States relations with the rest of the world. American Nativism If there is an appropriate label to stick on this fermenting vat, it is nativism. By that we mean a rather inchoate mix of atavistic nationalism, xenophobia, aggressiveness, righteous religiosity and racism dressed up as patriotism. Deep-seated sense of grievance and pervasive feelings that the true American has been sold out provide the fuel. Each of these elements has precedents in American history and roots in American society. They periodically have surfaced in political movements from the Know-Nothings who in the 1850s were empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by German and Irish Catholic immigrants, to the paranoia that accompanied the Red Scare in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution and then reappeared with greater intensity in the form of McCarthyism. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads Vote Trump on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) Todays manifestations have a larger economic component. The optimistic creed that has been the lifeblood of America has been sapped by the plight of salaried workers after decades of wealth redistribution upwards, the hollowing out of the countrys industrial core, the financializing of business, and the emergence of a gig economy that promises only more dislocation, insecurity, skimpy or no benefits, and declining living standards. Rugged individualism dictates that individual persons should assume responsibility for their failings; stoic fatalism in the face of external forces that drain all hope is quite another matter. Blame, like discontent, is free-floating. Its locus shifts among Wall Street, government leaders, and foreigners. The last most interests us here. Factors originating beyond the nations borders are prominent targets. They range from globalization as an abstract new reality, to Benedict Arnold companies that off-shore jobs and tax liabilities, to U.S. leaders who sign away American interests in one-sided trade deals to hostile governments who are cheaters. Sold Out There is more than a grain of truth in the complaints directed at all of those mentioned. The common man, as we quaintly used to call workers, indeed has been sold out by the bosses  economic and political. In truth, most of that selling out has been by elites favoring other elites here at home at the expense of the general populace. Foreigners are politically more convenient targets, though. Hillary Clinton speaking at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona,   by Gage Skidmore) The primary question is whether the disposition to blame external parties will manifest itself in antagonistic action. That has been the pattern elsewhere at other times. It is by no means obvious, though, that this logic holds in the case of the United States today. This is certainly true as regards any large-scale use of military force. Fifteen years of relentless, failed wars in the greater Middle East have drained the country of the passion for violence with which Americans retaliated for 9/11. Whether a President Hillary Clinton would expand operations in Syria is unaffected by the American publics anger over illegal immigration or biased trade agreements. A vague distaste for ungrateful, grasping foreigners does not eclipse aversion to expensive new adventures abroad or skepticism that they will work. As to Russia, the current high-decibel condemnation of Moscows alleged machinations is more an elite phenomenon, led by the security establishment, than it is an expression of popular outrage. Few Americans identify with the Syrian rebels whom Vladimir Putin is fighting or Ukrainian paramilitaries burning people alive in Odessa. The negative view of Russia, and Putin personally, so assiduously cultivated by politicos and the mainstream media does not translate into a broad fear or hatred among the American people. The pervasive obsession with the Red Menace that marked the Cold War remains dormant. That is even true in Europe  except for the Poles and the Baltics. Washington chooses to be rhetorically aggressive and to take the much publicized steps of building up NATO forces around Russias periphery. But there is little stomach for actually raising a risk of direct conflict. In conclusion, American policy toward Russia and the Middle East will follow the tracks laid down by the Obama administration with little deviation  and no greater success. The Dark Side Every society has its dark and dangerous undercurrents. Americas is laced with racism and fed by a deep pool of personal insecurities. The recrudescence of coarse racism, the deep psychic anxieties of the white males of Middle America, the embrace of jingoism, the frustrations of trailer park super-patriots, and the desperation of tormented Evangelicals torn over the question of whether a prospective nuclear Iran is a sign that the End Days are approaching or a serious speed-bump on the road to Rapture  together, these elements are creating an emotional maelstrom that has found an odd idol in the buffoonish persona of Donald Trump. Afghan children await school supplies from Allied forces at Sozo School in Kabul. (French navy photo by Master Petty Officer Valverde) The longer it lasts, the more attached Trump himself becomes to the pipedream of writing his name on the wind forever  and the more his followers see themselves affirmed and exalted. Finally, we have to come to terms with the dismaying truth that public opinion, in individuals and in aggregate, is only exceptionally the outcome of an informed and thoughtful process of deliberation. It is the rationalist myth that we are by nature thinking creatures inclined to viewing the world around us in an emotionally detached, mature manner. Very, very few persons approximate that model. Inherited loyalties, deep-seated prejudices and preferences, private emotions, the attraction or repulsion of personality  all of these elements come into play to considerable degree. In todays society where attachments of all sorts are weak and evanescent, where political parties have little cohesion, where associational life has faded, where we are exposed to the barrage of media imagery and messaging, the rationalist model has become less and less valid. Most of us are shaped by influences that we only dimly perceive  whether calculated intent lies behind them or not. Immigration Hot Button Thus, it is immigration that has become the hot button issue involving other countries. Passions are aroused by two things: the presence of millions of illegals from Mexico and Central America; and the prospect of Islamic terrorists entering the United States masquerading as refugees. Syrian women and children refugees at Budapest railway station. (Photo from Wikipedia) The two merge at the most primitive level of emotions. Together, they deepen worries that the world is spinning out of control in ways that call into question the country the many American people know (or imagine they know). Projections of rapidly increasing Latino populations, which threaten to overwhelm school districts and voter rolls, ruffle the feathers of many Middle Americans. Alarm that welfare and other social problems are siphoning off much needed public moneys in the age of austerity add a tangible economic element to these anxieties. Could this lead to implementation of the sorts of draconian ethnic cleansing programs advocated by Donald Trump? Unlikely  despite his ability to insert them into so-called mainstream discourse about the problem. It is easy to exaggerate the extent and the intensity of anti-immigrant feelings. Most Americans encounter little of it in their daily lives. Those who do in places like Texas or California pretty much take it as a given: something that should be dealt with but not a matter requiring urgent action. Arizona is different. Thats where the extreme Rightists (and the Republican politicos whom they have intimidated into obedience) make most of the noise. Foreign observers should note that the situation in the U.S. is very different from that in Western Europe. Not only is the United States a very big country where relatively large populations can get lost but, equally important, social space is not as tightly configured. Outside of small towns, there is little sense of traditional community to be protected. Americanism trumps all as the successful integration of waves of immigrants throughout the countrys history has demonstrated. While Latinos do present some unusual complications (unlike South or East Asian immigrants), visceral concerns about a denaturing of culture and society are relatively weak. (After all, 25 percent of baseball players in the professional leagues are Latinos  most from abroad.) So, the politics of immigration policy reform has not changed. The policies and unresolved dispute over what to do next will remain in their present indeterminate state. The Terrorism Scare The immigration-terrorism link is a far more passionate matter. It taps the terrorism psychosis that has gripped the country since 9/11. The graphic outbreak of mass shootings over the past year has rekindled feverish emotions. The fact that the Orlando/San Bernadino/New York/New Jersey perpetrators had some vague connection with jihadi groups in the Middle East has given these events a transnational dimension. It doesnt seem to matter that perps were American-born citizens or had grown up in the U.S. Islamic terrorists prepare to execute a wounded policeman after their attack on the offices of French magazine Charlie Hebdo on Jan. 7, 2015. Logically speaking, a detached observer could infer that restrictive immigration from the Mideast or of Muslims generally would have no bearing on the level of terrorist threat. But facts in the age of Trump have lost much of their purchase on the American mind. One fact that is incontrovertible is that politicians run scared on all matters that are related to terrorism  however oblique. The foot-dragging of President Obama on accepting any significant number of Syrian refugees is exhibit number one. Hostility toward Muslims generally is on the rise as witness the spike in abusive incidents in recent months. They now are occurring at a higher rate than they did in the wake of 9/11. By contrast, public authorities at all levels are less inclined to pursue surveillance and detention policies that skirt the law compared to that earlier period. The net effect will be a deepening perception around the world that the United States is hostile toward Islam. That is grist for the mill of the jihadis and opportunistic politicians. While it seems unlikely that signs of Islamo-phobia in American society will affect the thinking and actions of government leaders, they very well could register in the communities from which suicide bombers and terrorists are drawn  in Europe especially and among certain unbalanced individuals in the United States itself. That cycle thereby gains velocity. What about the economic sphere? It is there that one might reasonably expect the preoccupations of the presidential campaign to affect the policy of a new administration. Economic nationalism follows naturally from aroused popular discontents that finger the forces of globalization as a prime cause of the economic plight in which tens of millions of American find themselves. That is to say, one might anticipate that American officials will take a more searching look at the bottom-line impact of the accelerating integration of the world economy whose promotion has been a centerpiece of American foreign policy since the early 1990s  as actively and optimistically promoted by Hillary Clintons husband. The process has tremendous momentum  institutional (via such entities as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank), political and intellectual. Economic thinking, academic and governmental, has been totally dominated by the twin market fundamentalist concepts of General Market Equilibrium Theory and benign globalization. A Bow to Inequality While it has become trendy for all and sundry to make a ceremonial bow to the inequality phenomenon, it is hard to see the momentum of this juggernaut being blocked by disorganized displays of populism. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who served under President Bill Clinton, personifies this state of affairs. One of the architects and master builders of the financialized, unregulated transnational economy who fought ruthlessly to bail out Wall Street at the expense of Main Street after the 2008 crash, he now punctuates his innumerable public appearances with warnings that we should pay attention to the inequality dilemma. This homily is not a prelude to any action. Rather, it is akin to the Mafia don who devoutly crosses himself every time that his limousine crosses the path of a religious procession on a Saints Day. That is the outlook in the United States under Hillary Clinton. The one exception might by the TPP and TIIP trade treaties with Asia. Both were crafted by elites imbued by the optimistic globalization creed, both were kept secret except for the financial and commercial interests who were participants in their drafting, and both go far beyond traditional trade matters. The former, in particular, represents a radical transference of power from national governments to private parties institutionalized in expert panels heavily biased toward the latter. Indeed, many of its provisions may be unconstitutional  as a fair-minded Supreme Court could rule. That recondite aspect of TPP did not get an airing during the campaign. However, the tying of the treaty to the damaging effects of trade treaties forced even its supporters to equivocate. Hillary Clinton had been an enthusiastic backer until Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump began to reap political hay by condemning it. She now declares that is acceptable only if significant new conditions are met. What will be her ultimate position? She may be spared that agonizing decision were Obama able to push a lame-duck session of the Senate to ratify it. Otherwise, it may just be the one and only piece of American foreign relations that changes as a result of the election campaign. Continuity is likely to prevail elsewhere. Americans overall will remain the insular, parochial, moralizing and largely ignorant citizens they have been. That leaves plenty of space for a foreign-policy establishment driven by a powerful inertia to add to its long string of mishaps.

 November 12, 2016 The narrow split in the U.S. electorate revealed by Donald Trumps election as President ended with a victory of white America over diverse America with long-lasting consequences, says moral theologist Daniel C. Maguire. By Daniel C. Maguire My reaction four days out from the moral tragedy of Donald Trumps election as President is this: we are two nations, not one nation. On Nov. 8, 2016, one nation, a very white, very gerrymandered nation, braced by feeble voter turnout, conquered the other. The conquest will continue for at least a generation since it includes control of the U.S. Supreme Court. Mid-term elections may bring minor relief (or possibly not because Senate Democrats have far more seats to defend than Republicans) but the conquering nation knows that the Supreme Court and other judges pipe the tune to which all must dance. President-elect Donald Trump and his running mate Mike Pence thank their supporters for the upset victory on Nov. 8, 2016. (Photo from donaldjtrump.com) In this new regimen, the environment loses, true democracy loses, unions lose, education loses, women lose, especially those with problem pregnancies, a free press loses, peace-makers lose, people of color lose, illegal immigrants lose, international alliances lose, the goal of basic health care for all loses, the regulations of corporate greed lose, occupied people like the Palestinians lose, sexual minorities lose, real religious freedom loses, the splintered Democratic party loses, and voter turnout continues to lose. And in all losses, the poor are the greatest losers. There is nothing new in this. The Exodus story in the Bible (when not misunderstood as history) is a metaphor for human societies. Properly interpreted, Exodus was saying that human social organization teeters between the Egyptian pyramidal model of one percent rule and the alternative Sinai model based on appropriate sharing where there will be no poor among you (Deut. 15:4) and where swords will gradually be beaten into plowshares. In the brief period after the Second World War, ending in the early 1970s, the United States getting closer to the Sinai sharing model. Even under Republican Dwight Eisenhower, the top marginal income tax rate was 90 percent. Justice consists in sharing, said Thomas Aquinas. During that brief moral interlude, there was sharing and a healthy middle class, along with the best-educated young in the world. We receded from that in subsequent decades, and on Nov. 8, 2016, we solemnly broke faith with humanitys best hopes. The tragedy is terminal only if hope, the most revolutionary of emotions, also dies. The Deuteronomist said that we can choose life or we can choose death and then begged us, choose life for your childrens sake. That salient challenge remains in the wake of this debacle. Daniel C.

 November 19, 2016 An ugly side of Donald Trumps victory has been the unleashing of bigotry against minorities and women with the President-elect only mildly reining in these belligerent followers, writes Michael Winship. A friend of mine who has dual Israeli-American citizenship tells the story of entering an elevator in Jerusalem shortly after a bullying right-wing government had taken over the country. The other passenger was ostentatiously puffing on a big cigar. My friend pointed to the no smoking sign and politely, in Hebrew, asked the man to douse his smoke. Eff you, the man replied. Were in charge now. Only he didnt say, Eff. The Confederate battle flag, seen by many around the world as a symbol of white supremacy, has had a resurgence in public displays following Donald Trumps victory. Sound familiar? Well, its a tiptoe through the tulips compared to whats going on in the United States right now. Incidents of hate-related violence and other abuses have proliferated throughout this lovely land of ours. The presidential campaign and now the election results have further allowed the pinheads of society to let their racist, misogynistic, anti-Semitic and Islamophobic freak flags fly. Despite denials from many on the Right and the Trump transition team, this is really happening  unlike that avalanche of fake news stories that have been overwhelming social media. (And yes, I know have been scattered incidents in which Trump followers have been vilified on the streets, but far fewer.) Journalists who investigated Trump, his businesses, family and associates have been mailed anti-Semitic screeds or threatened with violence and even death. Women who have reported on Trump have been sent the vilest sexist epithets. Kshama Sawant, the socialist city council member from Seattle who recently urged protests at Trumps inauguration in January, has been targeted for email and phone attacks, some of which have suggested that she kill herself. Just about everyone I know has a story or two or three from the last week and a half. My friend Deana tells of a part-Asian co-worker swung at by a white male who mistook him as being from the Middle East, of a friends boyfriend who was told to Go back to Africa on his Facebook page, of another friends middle-school-aged daughter and other girls who were pushed around by boys in her class, some wearing Trump T-shirts and shouting hateful things about women. An Upsurge in Ugliness From the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) : Between Wednesday, Nov. 9, the day after the presidential election, and the morning of Monday, Nov. 14, [SPLC] collected 437 reports of hateful intimidation and harassment  Venues of harassment included K-12 schools (99), businesses (76) and universities (67). Common also was vandalism and leafleting on private property (40) and epithets and slurs hurled from moving vehicles (38).   Trump and his running mate Mike Pence thank their supporters for the upset victory on Nov. 8, 2016. (Photo from donaldjtrump.com) A new report from the FBI states that last year, hate crimes were up 6 percent, with a two-thirds increase in attacks against Muslims. According to their statistics, There were 5,818 single-bias incidents involving 7,121 victims. Of those victims, 59.2 percent were targeted because of a race/ethnicity/ancestry bias; 19.7 percent because of a religious bias; 17.7 percent because of a sexual-orientation bias; 1.7 percent because of a gender-identity bias; 1.2 percent because of a disability bias; and 0.4 percent because of a gender bias. Camila Domonosket at NPR notes, The FBI report is based on local law enforcement data. It almost certainly understates the scale of the problem: In 2014, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimated, based on victim surveys, that 60 percent of hate crimes are never reported to police. Here in New York City, the police department reports that so far in 2016 , hate crimes have jumped 30 percent from the same period last year, including a spike during last weeks hotly contested presidential election, according to DNAInfo New York . NYPD statistics show that anti-Muslim and anti-sexual orientation motivations were responsible for much of the rise. But what was Donald Trumps response to the reports of the upswing in hate crimes after his election? I am very surprised to hear that, he told 60 Minutes Lesley Stahl . I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that. Lesley Stahl: But you do hear it? Donald Trump: I dont hear it  I saw, I saw one or two instances  Lesley Stahl: On social media? Donald Trump: But I think its a very small amount. Again, I think its  Lesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people? Donald Trump: I would say dont do it, thats terrible, cause Im gonna bring this country together. Lesley Stahl: Theyre harassing Latinos, Muslims  Donald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, Stop it. If it  if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it. Stop it. Really? Thats all? You sounded like a parent telling the kids in the back seat to quit fidgeting. Make your condemnation swift, adamant and loud. We know you know how to do loud. Demand that it cease. The Bannon Factor And while were at it, Mr. President-elect, the appointment of your campaign CEO Steve Bannon as counselor and chief White House strategist makes a hideous situation even worse. Cancel it. Steve Bannon, political adviser to   Trump. (Photo from YouTube) This is, after all, the person who  more than a year ago!  Joshua Green at Bloomberg BusinessWeek succinctly described as the most dangerous political operative in America. Julia Zorthian at TIME magazine writes that as head of the alt-right news website Breitbart , Bannon has given voice to some of the unsavory forces floating around the conservative movements fringe, including a resurgence of white nationalism. His appointment has fueled anger , with critics decrying Bannons connections to racist and anti-Semitic views. In recent days, many of you have seen some of Breibart s headlines: Bill Kristol: Republican spoiler, renegade Jew, Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy, Would you rather your child had feminism or cancer? and Gay rights have made us dumber, its time to get back in the closet. Even The Washington Post s Kathleen Parker, who cut Bannon some slack in a recent column , concluded that he has been willing to strategically encourage peoples hate as a way of inciting them to action. How these methods will manifest themselves in the White House remains to be seen. But we can uncomfortably imagine that Trump under Bannons direction will do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Swell. So hate speech and Steve Bannon: a perfect pair. Donald Trump, youve let this evil genie out of the bottle. Set an example for a country so viciously torn asunder. Use one of your two remaining wishes and end this madness.

 November 21, 2016 Rust Belt voters turned to Donald Trump in hopes he could reindustrialize the U.S., but the President-elects plans could encounter major financial and geopolitical obstacles, says ex-British diplomat Alastair Crooke. By Alastair Crooke We are plainly at a pivotal moment. President-Elect Trump wants to make dramatic changes in his nations course. His battle cry of wanting to make America Great Again evokes  and almost certainly is intended to evoke  the epic American economic expansions of the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries. Trump wants to reverse the off-shoring of American jobs; he wants to revive Americas manufacturing base; he wants to recast the terms of international trade; he wants growth; and he wants jobs in the U.S.  and he wants to turn Americas foreign policy around 180 degrees. The run-down PIX Theatre sign reads Vote Trump on Main Street in Sleepy Eye, Minnesota. July 15, 2016. (Photo by Tony Webster Flickr) It is an agenda that is, as it were, quite laudable. Many Americans want just this, and the transition in which we are presently in  dictated by the global elusiveness and search for growth (whatever is meant now by this term growth), clearly requires a different economic approach from that followed in recent decades. As Ral Ilargi Meijer has perceptively posited , greater self-reliance is the future of the world, post-growth, and post-globalization. Every country, and every society, needs to focus on self-reliance, not as some idealistic luxury choice, but as a necessity. And that is not as bad or terrible as people would have you believe, and its not the end of the world   It is not an idealistic transition towards self-sufficiency, its simply and inevitably whats left, once unfettered growth hits the skids.Our entire world views and philosophies are based on ever more and ever bigger and then some, and our entire economies are built upon it. That has already made us ignore the decline of our real markets for many years now . We focus on data about stock markets and the like, and ignore the demise of our respective heartlands, and flyover countriesDonald Trump looks very much like the ideal fit for this transition   What matters [here] is that he promises to bring back jobs to America, and thats what the country needs   Not so they can then export their products, but to consume them at home, and sell them in the domestic market  Theres nothing wrong or negative with an American buying products made in America instead of in China. Theres nothing economically  let alone morally  wrong with people producing what they and their families and close neighbours themselves want, and need, without hauling it halfway around the world for a meagre profit. At least not for the man in the street. Its not a threat to our open societies, as many claim. That openness does not depend on having things shipped to your stores over 1000s of miles, that you could have made yourselves, at a potentially huge benefit to your local economy. An open society is a state of mind, be it collective or personal. Its not something thats for sale. A Great Wish Thats Trumps ostensible great wish, (it seems). It is not an unworthy one, but things have changed: America is no longer what it was in the Nineteenth or Twentieth centuries, neither in terms of untapped natural resources, nor societally. And nor is the rest of the world the same either. Mr. Trump rather unfortunately may find that his chief task will not be the management of this Great Re-orientation, but more prosaically, fending off the headwinds which he will face as he hauls on the tiller of the economy. In short, there is a real prospect that his ambitious economic remake may well be prematurely punctured by financial crisis. These headwinds will not be of his making, and for the main part, they lie beyond human agency per se . They are structural, and they are multiple. They represent the accumulation of an earlier monetary doctrine which will fetter the President-elect into a small corner from which any chosen exit will carry adverse implications. Ditto for anyone else trying to steer any ship of state in this contemporary global economy. Paradoxically  in an era moving toward greater self-sufficiency  what success Trump may have, however, will likely depend not on self-reliance so much as he would like. For his foreign policy about turn, he will depend on finding common interest with Russian President Vladimir Putin (that should not be too hard)  and for the economic about turn  on Trumps ability not to confront China, but to come to some modus vivendi with President Xi (less easy). Things are not what they were. Complexity theory tells us that trying to repeat what worked earlier  in very different conditions  will likely not work if repeated later. In the Clinton era, for example, 85 percent of the U.S. population growth derived from the working-age population. The headwind that Trump will face is that, over the next eight years, 80 percent of the population growth will comprise 65+ year olds . And 65+ year olds are not a good engine of economic growth. This is not an uniquely American problem; it is a global trend too. The peak growth (according to Econimica blog), in the annual combined working age population (15-64 year/olds) among all the 35 wealthy OECD nations, China, Brazil, and Russia has collapsed since its 1981 peak. The annual growth in the working age population among these nations has fallen from +29 million a year to just +1 million in 2016   but from here on, the working age population will be declining every year   These nations make up almost three quarters of all global demand for oil and exports in general. But their combined working age populations will shrink every year, from here on (surely for decades and perhaps far longer). Global demand for nearly everything is set to suffer.  (FFR stands for Federal Funds Rate: i.e. the US key interest rate) Source: http://econimica.blogspot.it/2016/11/trump-lies-no-different-than-obama-or.html And then there is China : It too is passing through a difficult transition from the old economy to an innovative one. It too, has an aging population and a debt problem (with a debt-to-gross domestic ratio reaching 247 percent). Trump argues that China deliberately holds down the value of its currency to gain unfair trade advantage, and he further suggests that he intends to confront the Chinese government on this key issue. Again, Trump does have a point (many nations are managing their exchange rates precisely in order to try to steal a little bit extra growth from the diminished global pot). But as noted at Zerohedge, citing the analysis of One River Asset Management executive Eric Peters: Whats good for the US in this case [the rising dollar and interest rates in anticipation of Trumponomics], is not good for emerging markets (EMs). Emerging markets benefit from a weaker dollar, and youre not going to get that. Emerging markets benefit from global capital flows moving in their direction and thats not happening either. Back in February, emerging markets were in sharp decline, driven by (1) a strong dollar, (2) rising US interest rates, and (3) slowing Chinese growth. Then China spurred a massive credit stimulus, the Fed became wildly dovish, and the dollar declined sharply. Interest rates collapsed throughout the year. As the growing pool of dollar, euro and yen liquidity searched for a decent return, it headed to emerging markets. Trump has reignited the dollar rally, and his fiscal stimulus will force interest rates higher. This reversed everything. [the dollars are heading home] And to be sure, the Beijing boys dont want to see material weakness ahead of next autumns Party Congress. But were currently near peak impulse from Chinas Q1 stimulus. In short, Peters is saying that, with the appreciating dollar and rising interest rate environment, growth from emerging markets as a whole will falter, since emerging markets have effectively leveraged their economies to Chinese growth. It used to be the case that they were closely tied to U.S. growth, but it is now China which dominates the EMs trade flows [i.e. without China growth, the EMs languish]. The question is, can America reboot its growth whilst China and the EMs languish? It is another structural shift, whereas heretofore, it was vice versa: without U.S. growth, the EMs and China languished. Now it is the converse. Hollowed-Out Economies There are other structural changes of course which will make it harder for the industrially hollowed-out economies of the West to recuperate jobs off-shored earlier. Firstly, there has been a systemic shift of innovation and technology eastwards (often to a more skilled and better-educated workforce). This represents not only an economic event, but a redistribution of power too. In any case, technology in this new era is being more job destructive than creative. In one sense, Trumps economic plan to get America working again through massive debt-financed, infrastructure projects, harks back to the Reagan era, which was also a period in which the dollar was strong. But yet again, things today are not what they were then. Inflation then was at 13 percent, Interest rates were around 20 percent, and crucially, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio was a mere 35 percent (compared to todays estimate of 71.8 percent or 104.5 percent with external debt included). Then, as Jack Rickards has suggested , the strong dollar was deflationary (deliberately so), and interest rates had nowhere to go, but down. It was the beginning of the three decades bond boom, which finally seems to have come to an end, coincident with Trumps election. Today, inflation has nowhere to go but up  as have interest rates  and the bond market, nowhere to go, but (perilously) down. Growth and Jobs? Can Trump then achieve growth and jobs through infrastructure expenditure? Well, growth is an ambiguous, shape-shifting term. The first chart shows both sides of the equation   the annual GDP growth and the annual federal debt incurred, spent, and (thus counted as part of the growth) to achieve the purported growth. Source: http://econimica.blogspot.it/2016/11/trump-lies-no-different-than-obama-or.html The second chart shows the annual GDP minus the annual growth in federal debt to achieve that GDP growth. In other words, unlike in the earlier Reagan times, more recently, the debt is producing no growth  but   well   just more debt, mostly. In fact, what the second chart is reflecting is the dilution  through money printing  of purchasing power: away from one entity (the American consumer), through the intermediation of the financial sector, to other entities (mostly financial entities, and to corporations buying back their own shares). This is debt deflation: the American consumer ends having less and less purchasing power (in the sense of residual discretionary income). The point here is that growth is becoming rarer everywhere. Russia and China, like everyone else, are in search for new sources for growth. As Rickards has said, debt is the devil that can undo Trumps whole schema: a $1 trillion infrastructure refurbishment plan, along with his proposal to rebuild the military, will  at least in the short-term  significantly increase annual deficits. In fact, deficits are already soaring; the fiscal 2016 budget hole jumped to $587 billion, up from $438 in the prior year, for a huge 34% increase in addition to this, Trumps protectionist trade policies would implement either a 35% tariff on certain imports or would require these goods to be produced inside the United States, at much higher prices. For example, the increase in labor costs from goods made in China would be 190% when compared to the federally mandated minimum wage earner in the United States. Hence, inflation is on the way. In sum, self-sufficiency implies higher domestic costs and price rises for consumers. Source: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-16/saudis-china-dump-treasuries-foreign-central-banks-liquidate-record-375-billion-us-p Debt will rise. And there is seemingly already a buyers strike against U.S. government debt underway: well over a third of a $1 trillion worth of Treasuries were disposed of, and sold in the year to Aug. 31 by foreign Central Banks. And who is buying it? (Below, the chart shows what this purchasing looks like, as a percentage of total debt issued by the Treasury). Well, foreign central banks have disappeared. (The Chinese have not bought a U.S. Treasury bond since 2011.) (Above: who purchased the marketable debt as a percentage, by period)Source: http://econimica.blogspot.it/2016/11/trump-lies-no-different-than-obama-or.html It is the American public who are buying. Will they be willing to take on Trumps $1 trillion infrastructure spree? Or, will it be printed in yet another dilution of the American consumers purchasing power? The question of whether the infrastructure splurge does give growth hangs very much in the balance to such answers. (Equity shares in construction firms will do okay, of course). The bottom line: (Michael Pento, Pento Report ): If interest rates continue to rise it wont just be bond prices that will collapse. It will be every asset that has been priced off that so called risk free rate of return offered by sovereign debt. The painful lesson will then be learned that having a virtual zero interest rate policy for the past 90 months wasnt at all risk free. All of the asset prices negative interest rates have so massively distorted including; corporate debt, municipal bonds, REITs, CLOs, equities, commodities, luxury cars, art, all fixed income assets and their proxies, and everything in between, will fall concurrently along with the global economy. For the record, a normalization of bond yields would be very healthy for the economy in the long-run, as it is necessary to reconcile the massive economic imbalances now in existence. However, President Trump will want no part of the depression that would run concurrently with collapsing real estate, equity and bond prices. A Pending Financial Crisis Trump, to be fair, has said consistently throughout the election campaign that whoever won the Presidential campaign to take office in January would face a financial crisis. Perhaps he will not face the violent unwind of the QE and bond bubble as some experts have predicted , but many more  according to Bank of Americas survey of 177 fund managers over the last six days, and controlling just under half a trillion of assets  expect a stagflationary bond crash. This has major political implications. Trump is setting out to do no less than transform the economy and foreign policy of the U.S. He is doing this against a backdrop of many of the followers of the liberal lite, so angered at the election outcome, that they reject completely his electoral legitimacy (and, with the lites themselves staying mum at this rejection of the U.S. democratic process). Movements are being organized to wreck his Presidency (see here for example). If Trump does indeed experience a severe financial unwind at a time of such domestic anger and agitation, matters could turn quite ugly.

 October 27, 2016 Special Report: Donald Trump claims the U.S. presidential election is rigged, drawing condemnation from the political/media establishment which accuses him of undermining faith in American democracy. But neither side understands the real problem, says Robert Parry. By Robert Parry We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan photographed together in the Oval Office in 1991. (Cropped from a White House photo that also included Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.) Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated. The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nations leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized. So, by 1968, the Democrats once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didnt want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that  with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided  President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam. President Richard Nixon with his then-National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in 1972. Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixons treason  from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election  he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford  three pillars of the Establishment  expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking: The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixons paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his treason  top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJs presidency  led to Nixons creation of the plumbers, a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the plumbers became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committees headquarters at the Watergate in Washington. National Security Adviser Walt Rostow shows President Lyndon Johnson a model of a battle near Khe Sanh in Vietnam. (U.S. Archive Photo) In that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reagans campaign feared that Carter might pull off an October Surprise by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reagans team take action to block Carters October Surprise? President Ronald Reagan, delivering his Inaugural Address on Jan. 20, 1981, as the 52 U.S. hostages in Iran are simultaneously released. Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Irans cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush with CIA Director William Casey at the White House on Feb. 11, 1981. (Photo credit: Reagan Library) By the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 October Surprise question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991. PBS Frontlines: The Election Held Hostage, co-written by Robert Parry and Robert Ross. Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beachs boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bushs reelection hopes in 1992. C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel under President George H.W. Bush. But Bushs White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received  and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993  there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagans election victory. Former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana. Lee Hamiltons decision to clear Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bushs rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000. President George W. Bush is introduced by his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before delivering remarks at Sun City Center, Florida, on May 9, 2006. (White House photo by Eric Draper) Indeed, if the full truth had been told about the fathers role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, its hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush stolen election in 2000. However, instead of leading with Gores rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred. Former Vice President Al Gore. (Photo credit: algore.com) By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000  even if the medias motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks  the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see s  Gores Victory ,  So Bush Did Steal the White House , and  Bush v. Gores Dark American Decade. ] Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the stolen elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful losers are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters will had been ignored or twisted. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies  uttered for the good of the country  is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest. So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isnt pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

 November 14, 2016 Republicans are claiming a mandate to speak for the silent majority, but the actual numbers show that not only did Donald Trump fail to win a plurality, his vote total largely matched other recent GOP candidates, notes Nicolas J S Davies. By Nicolas J S Davies Within days of the U.S. general election, central elements of the result have already entered into American mythology: the revenge of the white working class voter; the unprecedented anti-establishment character of the President-elect; the populist revolution that led to Trumps victory; and the years in the wilderness now facing Democrats and progressives in America. But the endless repetition of these themes by the corporate media deserves a great deal more skepticism and scrutiny before they worm their way into all our heads to form the established and accepted narrative of this election. Lets first review some basic facts about what happened on Nov. 8: Donald Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention. (Photo credit: Grant Miller/RNC) Who Voted Republican? Though Donald Trump prevailed in the Electoral College, he failed to secure a plurality of the total ballots cast, getting a bit over 60 million votes to Hillary Clintons 61 million votes, according to The Associated Press tally . Meanwhile, only 55.6 percent of 219 million eligible voters, or 50.4 percent of the voting-age population , actually voted, placing the U.S. 33rd out of 35 advanced (OECD) countries in national voter turnout , above only Chile and Switzerland. Only 27 percent of eligible voters or 24 percent of the voting-age population voted for Trump. Roughly the same number, about 60 million, voted for both John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. The result was different because Barack Obama received 69 million votes in 2008 and 66 million in 2012, while Hillary Clinton could only muster only a shade more than Trump, Romney and McCain. As Sen. Bernie Sanders repeated in every stump speech during the Democratic primaries, Let us never forget, Democrats and progressives win when voter turnout is high. Republicans win when people are demoralized and voter turnout is low. So, Trump deserves credit for finding a few new Republican voters to replace those who have died in the past fou4 years, and for a successful strategy to gain votes in the right states to win the Electoral College. But the more decisive difference with 2008 and 2012 was the dramatic failure of the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, to turn out the vote. This was despite, or maybe even because of, unprecedented SuperPAC money and overwhelming support from political, business and media elites. Democratic Hopes If the Democrats hope to do better in future elections, they must confront this reality. Grassroots Democrats should insist that party leaders finally abandon the long obsolete Reagan/Thatcher-lite Democratic Leadership Council model of politics based on fund-raising, propaganda, corporate welfare and militarism, and welcome the kind of new, progressive leadership that inspired 47 percent of Democratic primary voters to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders. Sen. Bernie Sanders speaking to one of his large crowds of supporters. (Photo credit: Sanders campaign) This was all the more significant and impressive in the context of party leaders monolithic support for Clinton and their shameful campaign to stage a coronation instead of organizing a free and fair primary election. We will find out more about who actually voted for Trump, but the pollster Nate Silver already exposed The Myth of Trumps Working Class Support in a fivethirtyeight .com article on May 3. Silvers article analyzed a survey of the average household income of people who voted in the 23 primaries up to that point. The average Clinton or Sanders primary voter had a household income of $61,000, while the average Trump voter earned $72,000, about the same as Cruzs supporters but less than Kasichs. The 70 percent of eligible voters who did not vote in either primary had an average household income of $52,000. In broad terms, this tracks the traditional pattern of U.S. politics, with wealthier Americans leaning Republican, the middle-class favoring Democrats and few of the poor African-Americans and immigrants who make up much of the real U.S. working-class voting at all. These figures were for primary voters, but they suggest that Trumps supporters were, well, Republicans, like Romneys, McCains, Bushs and so on. The Republican Party has continually rebranded itself over the past 50 years, generating great fanfares from deferential or captive corporate media for the Silent Majority, the Reagan Revolution, the Moral Majority, the Christian Right, the Contract With America, the Tea Party and now Trumps Deplorables, but behind these well-funded P.R. campaigns, Republican voters remain roughly the same people or class of people. Edward Bernays, the father of modern propaganda and advertising, would approve their ever-changing public message! What is Trumps agenda? Despite contradictory pronouncements on many issues, Donald Trumps published plan for his first 100 days in office contained more policy details than Hillary Clintons campaign web site, which followed the DLC model of appealing to principles most Americans believe in without pinning the candidate down to anything detailed enough for most voters to disagree with. In Clintons case, this includes voluminous treatises on a wide array of subjects, but the blizzard of words was short on actual policy details, leaving the formerly presumptive president plenty of room to do whatever she and her corporate and military-industrial colleagues really planned to do after the coronation. As Wikileaks revealed, one of the few things Clintons staff and financiers were clear on was the necessarily wide gap between her public and private positions . Warmed-Over GOP Fare On the other hand, Donald Trumps plan for his first 100 days in office includes more specifics and is, for the most part, a pretty standard wish-list of policies the Republican Party has backed for decades. That still leaves plenty of room for smoke and mirrors: President Obama in the Oval Office. On Trumps first day in office, he plans to cancel every unconstitutional action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama; to cancel federal funding to cities that provide sanctuary to undocumented immigrants; to begin deporting 2 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records (somehow expanding that group from the 178,000 counted in a 2010 Congressional report before Obamas mass deportations reduced it still further); to stop issuing U.S. visas to people in countries that wont accept unlimited numbers of U.S. deportees; to suspend immigration from terror-prone regions; and to begin work on selecting a new Supreme Court justice. The legislative portion of Trumps agenda starts with massive tax reduction, including an across-the-board 15 percent corporate tax rate, which drops to 10 percent for repatriated offshore earnings to reward the outsourcing he condemned on the campaign trail. This is balanced politically by a vague promise of unspecified new tariffs to penalize future outsourcing. The American Energy and Infrastructure Act will declare open season on the environment and the climate, stimulating energy infrastructure projects like the Keystone XL pipeline with tax cuts and corporate welfare, and ending U.S. payments to the U.N. climate fund. A national school voucher program will expand the privatization of public education, while Trump also pays lip service to local control, reducing college tuition and ending common core. Trump wants to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a new program based on health savings accounts, along with similar programs for childcare and elder care; states will be allowed to make unprecedented cuts in Medicaid; and he wants the Food and Drug Administration to speed up approvals for 4,000 new drugs. As well as funding Trumps wall on the Mexican border, new draconian immigration laws will impose mandatory 2- and 5-year federal prison sentences on previously deported immigrants who try to reenter the U.S. New national security and community safety laws will blast military spending past Obamas post-World War II record , and throw more money at local police to combat imaginary increases in crime, drugs and violence at home. Liberal state marijuana laws may be trumped by this new national stop and frisk program. Trump wants term limits in Congress to get rid of popular progressive legislators like John Conyers and Patrick Leahy. He also wants a federal civilian hiring freeze and sweeping deregulation under which any new federal regulation must be offset by canceling two existing regulations. Controlling the Levers The most critical factor in the Republicans new-found power is that they now control the White House and both houses of Congress, as they did from 2003 to 2006 and for a shorter spell in 1953-54. This does not usually end well for them. The last time the Republicans held full control of the U.S. government for more than 4 years was in the 1920s, and that ended even worse. President George W. Bush speaks on the phone in the Oval Office, Oct. 7, 2008, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, discussing efforts to solve the spreading global financial crisis. (White House photo by Eric Draper) If the Republicans exploit the support of 24 percent of Americans  not even a plurality of those who voted  to ram through their extreme right-wing agenda, they will deserve to be slung out on their ears in 2018 and 2020, as they were in 2006 and 2008. If rank-and-file Democrats can force their partys corrupt leaders to quickly hand over power to new progressive leadership who will represent the other 76 percent of Americans, this should not be a tall order. In the meantime, progressives can contain the damage by countering every part of the Republicans (and corrupt Democrats) agenda with clear, intelligent progressive proposals for real solutions to the serious problems facing our country and the world and building a popular movement around them. This will all be a real test for the Democrats, but it is one they have brought on themselves, and the radical clean-up required is what progressives have been demanding of the Democratic Party for a long time.

 November 22, 2016 The mixed signals from Donald Trumps transition are creating diverse interpretations of where his foreign policy is headed, with ex-CIA analyst Melvin A. Goodman seeing reasons to worry about more neocon warmongering. By Melvin A. Goodman My favorite philosopher, Garrison Keillor, stated in a different era that it will get worse before it gets worse. Well, once again, here we are. President-elect Donald Trumps naming of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as national security adviser; Sen. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, R-Alabama, as attorney general; and Rep. Michael Pompeo, R-Kansas, as director of the Central Intelligence Agency suggests that the dangerous positions taken by Trump during the presidential campaign will be supported by his  . Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn speaks at the Defense Intelligence Agency on July 24, 2012. (DoD photo by Erin A. Kirk-Cuomo) All three of these men have pandered to the Trump agenda and have taken particularly hardline views on matters dealing with immigration, the Muslim community, and the use of force. If Donald Trump actually decides to name a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clintons use of email at the Department of State, then he will have the support of these three men. Lt. Gen. Flynn is in a position to do the most damage to the national security interests of the United States. He was forced into retirement from the military in 2014 when the Joint Chiefs of Staff needed to stop his politicization of intelligence as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and his brutal management style resembling that of Captain Queeq on the USS Caine. Flynn reorganized the DIA in order to combine the roles of the intelligence analysts and the operatives, which created a smoother path for politicizing intelligence. This is the same reform that CIA director John Brennan has introduced into the CIA, which has had its own problems with politicized intelligence over the past several decades. At DIA, Flynn was known for endorsing specious intelligence reports and circulating his support for these reports in what was known facetiously as Flynn facts. Currently there is an investigation of DIA for the tailoring of intelligence on the success of the U.S. Army in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the general has been praised for his work in the operational and tactical fields, there are no examples of the kind of strategic thinking or experience to believe that Flynn would be useful in coordinating the policy views of the entire national security bureaucracy or in providing objective and balanced intelligence to the President. Flynn has already changed his views to accommodate the interests of Trump. Once an opponent of torture and abuse, Flynn over the past year has become a supporter. His consulting company has lobbied on behalf of the authoritarian interests of Turkish President Erdogan, and Flynn himself has been a regular commentator on RT, Moscows English language propaganda voice. At the Republican National Convention last summer, Flynn referred to Hillary Clinton as a member of the enemy camp and led the chants of lock her up. Pompeos Hard Line Rep. Pompeo was an initial supporter of the Tea Party and predictably took positions against abortion (even in cases of rape and incest); against the Affordable Care Act; and against any effort on the part of the Environmental Protection Agency to eliminate greenhouse gases. He favors a return to unrestricted massive surveillance by the National Security Agency; a death sentence for Edward Snowden; and more vigorous use of enhanced interrogation techniques at Guantanamo. When his committee was confronted with pictures of hunger strikers at Guantanamo, Pompeo facetiously remarked that it looked like that they had put on weight. Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas. Pompeo, like other members of the presidential transition staff, is a conspiracy thinker. He and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, who has been rumored as a possible choice as Secretary of Defense, were strong opponents of the Iran nuclear agreement and believe that there are secret side agreements that favor the interests of Tehran. Pompeo has charged that any Muslim citizen who doesnt vigorously denounce acts of terror is actually complicit with the attacks. Pompeo was a strong opponent of Senator Dianne Feinsteins devastating report on CIA torture and abuse, and conducted a vigorous attack on Secretary of State Clintons role in the Benghazi tragedy. When his colleague, former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, issued a report exonerating Clinton, Pompeo attached a polemical rebuttal. Sen. Sessions has been rewarded with the Department of Justice for being the first elected official to come out in support of Donald Trump. He is strongly opposed to any immigration reform, and has received a grade of F from various civil rights groups and the NAACP for his opposition to civil rights. In the 1980s, there was a successful bipartisan effort in the Senate to keep him from becoming a federal judge, with the decisive swing vote coming from Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Alabama. Sessions once referred to the American Civil Liberties Union as un-American and communist for trying to force civil rights down the throats of people. The appointment of a neoconservative   points the Trump administration in an extreme hardline direction. It is possible that the Director of National Intelligence will be weakened or even eliminated, and that the CIA will become even more involved in covert action, including regime change. The sudden resignation of James Clapper as director of national intelligence certainly points in this direction. President Barack Obamas failure to limit the CIAs paramilitary role and to seek accountability for the conduct of torture and abuse will allow   to get the CIA more heavily involved in paramilitary activities, which have damaged the reputation of the United States and the CIA in the past. The Iran-Contra scandal tarnished the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. CIA support for the mujahedeen in the 1980s led to the emergence of Al Qaeda and other fundamentalist terror organizations in the 1990s that we are still confronting. Although President Obama had some success in bringing sunlight into the darkened corridors of the national security state,  s appointment of these individuals suggests that the secret state will once again expand. A greater era of secrecy will be harmful to the interests of American citizens and even to our democracy. Melvin A.

in World  by Mirza Yawar Baig  November 10, 2016 Whew! Finally, the charade is over. Donald Trump is now the President of the United States of America. What does that mean? It means that Simpsons prediction came true: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2146815/the-simpsons-correctly-predicted-a-donald-trump-presidency-16-years-ago-in-episode-set-in-the-near-future/ So now you know who to refer to for accurate predictions about the future. Goodbye Tarot cards, et al. In 1995 I recall reading a survey which concluded that America was not likely to be ready for a woman president for the next twenty years. Twenty-one years later, it looks like that prediction was true. Given that women in America to this day are paid 80% of what men are paid, it is not surprising that Americans find it tough to visualize a woman in the White House in any place other than the Presidents bed. So, what does Trump mean for America, for American Muslims, for Muslims worldwide, for non-whites in America and globally? I am asking this rhetorical question as I see all kinds of doomsday predictions flying around. I apologize for taking a different view. I see the Trump presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that Donald Trump promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was. What does Trump mean for America? I hope he will be the best thing that happened to America ever. I hope that he can truly make America Great Again. I say that because though I am not American (should I say, Thank God?), I am one who believes that a truly Great America, can make this world great. The world truly needs to change. We need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate, caring, fighting against injustice, corruption and poverty; disease and ignorance. Which nation is better suited to lead that fight? America has the resources, the intelligence, the education and the leadership ability which I hope it chooses to exercise. Trump won on the anti-establishment platform. I support that fully. The establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly. The economy crashed and Obama rewarded those who crashed it. People were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every American to have two homes, not only one. Yet they are on the streets. I hope Trump can put Americans back in their own homes. Bush father and son, started never ending wars. Obama continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes  using technology to create bug splats (the arrogance is incredible)  thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation. Obamas dabbling (what else to call it?) in Middle Eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of Afghanistan and Iraq and new misery for people of Syria and by inference for the rest of the world. And to top it all ISIS came into being because of all of the above. The credit can be shared by all of them. So, Trump standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this. I sincerely hope so. All the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality. It is easy to talk about kicking out the Mexicans and so on. But the day he does that, reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted Pro-Brexit; that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor dont need the rich. When nice white Americans get to pay $3 per potato, they will realize the value of cheap labor. Meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the Wall, which he will do from the Mexican side, no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile. So also, the wonderful idea to outlaw the H-1 visa. I dont think it will take very long for Trump and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes. And that Indians are not blond. Go figure that. The good news is that Trump made public what was private  racism, misogyny in a country that never stops trumpeting about womens equality, support for genocide, wars and weapons sales, the evils of unbridled capitalism, locker-room conversations which indicate attitudes  have all come out of the closet and locker-room. Now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things, to get off their backsides and bring about change. They can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to, saying, It is not happening here. Trump proved that it is happening and has trumpeted it from the top of Trump tower. Sorry for so much bad punning in one breath. But there you go. As for Muslims and Trump, believe me Trump is far better than what Muslims have seen in the past. He is far better than what we have today. Take Sisi, the Oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer, the Paki leadership and I can think of several more and Trump begins to look like a choir boy. What will he do that is not already happening? Frankly I dont know and dont care to speculate because the prime movers behind Muslim affairs and how they are, are Muslims themselves. Our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure. Ordinary citizens pay the price, but whats new about that? The fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny, we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by. Play endings depend on the script, not on the players. India is a classic example where a so-called minority of 200 million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends. But Indian Muslims seem to be satisfied with that, so who is anyone else to complain. If you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied, then I must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious; get their act together, change their leaders and write their own script. 200 million is not a minority. It is a nation. But only if it chooses to be. Same story for Muslims globally. No point in blaming Trump or looking up to him to find solutions. It is our problem and we must solve it, so let us start doing that. Two other points: what about wars, global warming and such issues? Well, when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them, how can you pin it all on Trump? If weapons are made and sold, there will be wars. Wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them. That people die is incidental. Those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank, dont. Those that do, dont count. They are collateral, who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them. If it wasnt for the bugs who splatted, how would you assess the drones or their operators? The fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on; well, bugs are bugs. And thats all that there is to it. Global warming? America decided on that when it chose Bush instead of Al Gore. For a minute I thought that was because they got confused because his name is Al Gore like Al Ghurair. But then I realized that it was because he had a terminal problem; he had a brain. See his famous movie, An Inconvenient Truth, and you will see what I mean. https://www.algore.com/library/an-inconvenient-truth-dvd If you do nothing else, buy this and see it. At least you will know why you died. Since you chose that, especially Americans, I believe it is only fair that you understand what you did. With Trump, that came out in the open, so get used to summer all year long. You wont need to go to the French Riviera for a tan. You can get it at home. That is not inconvenient. Add to this the effect ofunending wars, refugee movement, changing cultures, security nightmares coming true, widening gap between the rich and the poor, global poverty and hunger, preventable disease which is not prevented because theres no profit in it  when I think about all this and Trumps election, Nero comes to mind. Renewing our link with tradition. Let us dance to the tune. Whats the use of fiddling otherwise? Final question that everyone is asking, How safe is it to have someone like Trump with his finger on the nuclear button? My answer is, The one who actually pressed that button was as different from Trump as could be. Yet he did it. Let me leave you to figure out the rest. Meanwhile it is midnight where I live, far away from Trump and America and time to go to bed. Truly it is said that there is solace in sleep. So, good night, world. Sleep well. As long as you stay asleep you can escape responsibility.

Dublin, Ireland.The West is feeling more and more like an irrational maze. The banks are mad. The austerity too. But the anti-Russia hysteria is the final straw. Its not just anti-Russia: its anti-truth, anti-rational and anti-modern. Its the end result of postmodernism. What began as irony is now systematic madness.Everything is upside down. Or maybe at last its the right side up. Maybe the West to begin with never was the Free World. Wasnt that the whole point of modernism? Modernism was self criticism. Modernism was critical of the West. And then along came postmodernism. And the West suddenly was off the hook. The West wearing the clothes of postmodernism went on the attack again.The end result is that anything goes as long as the West wins. Forget the truth. Forget the facts. And forget history. Everything apparently is fiction. The West can say what it wants because everything is interpretation. Thats the beauty of postmodernism. You can contradict yourself a million times and laugh it all off. As long as youve the power. And thats the key word: power. Because postmodernism was from the word go a political project. One that was made in the West for the West.The end result is hatred for Russia. And love for Al-Qaeda. Why? Because Russia attempted to rationalise the world. It attempted to apply reason to the 21st century. And so the irrational West had to punish it. Listen to Putin in 2007 when he spoke in Munich:However, what is a unipolar world? However one might embellish this term, at the end of the day it refers to one type of situation, namely one centre of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making.It is [a] world in which there is one master, one sovereign. And at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system, but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within.And this certainly has nothing in common with democracy. Because, as you know, democracy is the power of the majority in light of the interests and opinions of the minority.Incidentally, Russia  we  are constantly being taught about democracy. But for some reason those who teach us do not want to learn themselves.I consider that the unipolar model is not only unacceptable but also impossible in todays world. And this is not only because if there was individual leadership in todays  and precisely in todays  world, then the military, political and economic resources would not suffice. What is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilisation.And listen to him in New York in 2015 when he spoke in the UN General Assembly: and so the export of revolutions, this time of so-called democratic ones, continues. It would suffice to look at the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, as has been mentioned by previous speakers. Certainly political and social problems in this region have been piling up for a long time, and people there wish for changes naturally.But how did it actually turn out? Rather than bringing about reforms, an aggressive foreign interference has resulted in a brazen destruction of national institutions and the lifestyle itself. Instead of the triumph of democracy and progress, we got violence, poverty and social disaster. Nobody cares a bit about human rights, including the right to life.I cannot help asking those who have caused the situation, do you realize now what youve done?Did you hear the plea for reason? Did you hear the cry for modernity? Did you hear the demand for moral foundations  for universal values  for international law? Did you hear the defence of national sovereignty and the defence of the UN Charter? The West didnt. In these two key Russian speeches (Munich 07 and New York 15) the West only heard a threat to its power.The Wests reply to Russias rationalism was and continues to be irrationalism. Media madness, Presidential paranoia and Islamic insanity is the Wests response to the truth. And the truth is no secret. But the West just shrugs its shoulders and laughs it all off. The truth is Western imperialism: the unipolar world, full spectrum dominance, neo-con mendacity, hybrid warfare, sanctions, speculation, special forces, the CIA, fundamentalism and American Exceptionalism. In short: Putin hit the nail on the head.And the West hit back. Why? Because the West cant defend itself rationally. There is no good reason for all the wealth found in the West. So there can only be a bad reason: imperial power. And modernism proved beyond doubt that it was bad. However as this power was rolled back in modern times  as the victims of Empire succeeded in liberating themselves  postmodern times came to the rescue of the West. In Nietzsche the West found its champion. The will to power was the Wests trump card. And with Nietzsches blessing it played it.For Nietzsche all that mattered was power. And whoever had it needed no justification or reason. Truth was a lie. And morality was only for the weak. However if this intellectual climate only emerged and became hegemonic in the late 1970s (think of Reagan and Thatcher) it of course was ever present behind the scenes in the dark corners of Western imperialism. For instance: Americas leading strategist (and Russian expert) after World War Two, George F. Kennan, famously put it into words in Memo PPS23 (1948):We have about 50% of the worlds wealth but only 6.3% of its population .Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships, which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity. To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality .We should cease to talk about vague .unreal objectives such as human rights, the raising of living standards, and democratisation. The day is not far off when we are going to have to deal in straight power concepts. The less we are hampered by idealistic slogans, the better.Nietzsche could not have said it better himself. The question is though: has this elite Western approach to the world changed since Kennan wrote Memo PPS23? No  it has only become more crass. As a result this Nietzschean worldview is what Russia is up against today. But havent we seen this before? Hasnt Nietzsche in another guise attacked Russia already? Have not the forces of irrationalism invaded Russia before? And did Russia not for our benefit defeat those forces of irrationalism? We still owe Russia.So lets support it today it by burying Nietzsche. And by resurrecting universal reason and all the ideals which are built upon it. Give modern secular life another chance. Not just in Syria but in the West too. Aidan OBrien is a hospital worker in Dublin, Ireland.
Email Donald Trump has stated that, on advice of his lawyer, he will not release his tax returns until his audit is concluded.1 By contrast, Hillary Clinton has released her federal 1040 returns, (but not her state or possible other returns). Language on her campaign website asserts that she and her running mate continue to set the standard for financial transparency. The Clinton returns reveal much information, but they reflect a standard short of full financial transparency. More significantly, the tax reductions the Clintons receive when donating to their foundation and the lower rate of self-employment taxes they paid compared to those who make much less reflect some of what is wrong with the U.S. tax system. Gross income is the gross receipts minus their business expenses and $3,000 of a carried forward capital loss that started in 2008.2 Total federal taxes is their income taxes minus foreign tax credits (for them, only years 2011-13)* plus self-employment taxes and additional taxes due to the Affordable Care Act (higher medicare taxes and taxes on investment income starting in 2013) * For the Clintons, the foreign tax credit came to $160,000 or less each year from 2011-13 and arose from work done abroad. For years 2010-2015, the table below shows the Clintons reported gross income, total federal taxes paid, charitable contributions, and the amount of the latter going to the Clinton Foundation. What follows mainly focuses on the Clintons 2014 tax return. Self-employment Income Almost all of the Clintons gross income after deducting expenses ($28,020,811) was derived from self-employment: with the biggest amounts for making speeches (slightly more than $8.7 million made by Hillary and $8.4 million by Bill), consulting ($6.1 million made by Bill,) and writing ($4.6 million made by Hillary.) All of their speaking income is paid by The Harry Walker Agency. However, under IRS rules, who paid the agency or to whom they spoke is not disclosed. The tax return indicates that $2.125 million of Bills consulting income, before deducting expenses, was paid by Gems Education. A Wikipedia article describes Gems Education as the largest operator of private kindergarten-to-grade-12 schools in the world, [that] as of 2015 has over 70 schools in over a dozen countries  In 2010, Bill Clinton named GEMS Education a strategic partner of the Clinton Global Initiative . According to the tax returns, in 2011, for the first time, GEMS Education paid Bill $500,000 raising its payment each year thereafter. Laureate Education paid Bill $4,292,475. It is described in the New York Times as a network of for-profit schools . In 2010, Laureate hired Bill as its new honorary chancellor. As disclosed on the tax returns, it paid him over $17.5 million from 2010-2015. Bills visits to Laureates campuses were described to have inspired students.3 The nature of the advice Clinton provided is not part of the tax return. Business Deductions Both Clintons took deductions against their self-employment income. These deductions are supposed to be ordinary and necessary meaning they are common and appropriate. Their expenses deducted for airfare, transportation, and hotels came to several times what most people earn at their jobs. In 2014, Bill claimed travel expenses of $375,793 for his speaking business, an amount considerably less than the $2,018,050 spent on travel for that business in 2013. By contrast, his total travel expenses for his consulting business for 2013 and 2014 together came to less than $600. Hillarys travel expenses for making speeches in 2014 came to $813,842. Another $288,504 was spent on travel for her writing business in 2014. Under IRS rules, specific details such as where they went and stayed, and for how long, are not provided. Self-employment tax Self-employment income is subject to self-employment taxes: social security and medicare taxes paid by the self-employed. In 2014, social security taxes were paid on only the first $117,000 of net income at a rate of 12.4% resulting in a maximum tax of $14,508. The medicare portion which is 2.9% of all net income had no income limits. If one adds the Clintons 2014 self-employment tax to their additional medicare tax under the Affordable Care Act, the total comes to $1,010,090 or 3.6% of their total net self-employment income. The Clinton returns show the gross unfairness of the self-employment tax that leaves those with high incomes paying a rate that is much lower than those with significantly less income. For example, a person making $30,000 of self-employment income after deducting expenses would pay a self-employment tax of $4,239 which is over 14% of their self-employment income, or more than 3 times the rate paid by the Clintons. Clintons Unearned Income From 2011-2014, the Clintons reported no dividend income from stock holdings, only interest income. In 2014, it came to only $25,171. All but $464 was paid by JP Morgan Chase Bank. How their money is invested with the bank is, as allowed by the IRS, not made clear probably in the form of CDs or bonds. By contrast, in 2007, the Clintons made over $1 million in interest income and over $90,000 in dividends. All of the latter is reported as coming from trusts. In 2007, they also reported over $15 million on the sale of stock held by their trusts. Most sales were for less than $100,000 with only one for slightly more the $250,000. Most sales occurred on or before May 11 reflecting very good timing since this was shortly before the financial meltdown. Their stock holdings were diverse. They consisted of holdings in major corporations including Bank of America, Wal-mart, Chevron, Exxon, General Electric, Honeywell, and Lehman Brothers prior to its bankruptcy. At first glance, one might see the Clintons as acting upon information that the economy would soon crash, but they may have decided to rid themselves of holdings that might be used against Hillary in her run for the presidency in 2008. Reporting no dividends from 2011-2014 probably indicates no re-entry into the stock market after the meltdown, or that they only purchased stocks that paid no dividends. There is a huge difference between their total interest and dividend income in 2007 of $1,159,836 with their 2014 interest income of $25,171 and no dividend income. Despite the low interest rates, how could their dividend and interest income have plummeted so much? Given the size of their total income all these years, one has to wonder if they have been spending it all or investing it in ways that do not show up on their tax returns.4 This raises other questions. Have they been making large gifts/political donations or paying large personal legal bills? Have they set up an entity that handles investments and pays taxes on the income generated instead of passing it through to them individually to report on their tax return? Charitable Contributions Those who usually receive the biggest reduction in their taxes per dollar donated are those with the highest income because they are in a higher tax bracket. Many charitable donors receive no tax reduction because they do not itemize their deductions. In 2014, the Clinton donation to their foundation of $3 million reduced their taxes $1,188,000 39.6% of the money donated, not including a probable savings of state taxes. This level of savings can be viewed as a government subsidy/giveaway to the rich since it reduces the governments revenue and allows the money donated to be used to support and finance the policies of their own foundation. In 2014, all but $200 of their remaining charitable contributions, $22,500, went to two churches. From 2010-2015, 2014 was the only year specified contributions went to religious organizations. Comparison to Romney 2010 Return In 2010, the Romneys reported on their tax return gross income of $21,661,344. Despite a gross income that was $8 million more than the Clintons that year, their total federal tax came to less than 14% of their gross income, $3,009,766 over $1,000,000 less than the amount of federal taxes paid by the Clintons. The main reason for the Romneys lower taxes was because most of their income came from investments which were taxed at a lower rate (a policy that began when Bill Clinton was president) while the bulk of the Clinton income was earned income which is taxed at a higher rate. Like the Clintons, the Romneys saved on their taxes by making donations. $1.525 million went to their church and over $1.45 million of stock was donated to their own foundation. It in turn made donations to entities including Brigham Young University, The George W. Bush Library, and the Harvard Business School. 4 Why All of the Above Smells Foul The rich are said to be different than most people. One difference is that three of the last four major party candidates for the presidency had their own foundation. This suggests that having a foundation could be a future requirement for being taken seriously as a candidate. By releasing their returns, the Clintons have acted with more transparency than Trump. Trump may be hiding something, but the Clinton returns raise many questions whose answers should be of concern to voters. The Clintons gross income declined sharply in 2015 from over $28 million in 2014 to $10,745,378. Nevertheless, this lower income could arouse disgust given the levels of poverty in the world and unmet basic needs of millions. The low level of taxes the rich pay under the IRS rules allow for the massing of fortunes which normally go untaxed during their lifetimes, except for whatever property taxes they pay on the real estate they own. Footnotes 1.By signing his Form 1040 return, Trump indicated, as stated above ones signature that Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this return and accompanying schedules and statements, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, they are true, correct, and complete . If what he submitted is true, correct and complete, shouldnt he be willing to share his returns with the public even if many lawyers think otherwise. See various views held by some lawyers on this issue at: http://lawnewz.com/politics/legal-experts-side-with-trump-it-would-be-totally-stupid-to-release-his-taxes-during-audit/ 2. The capital loss started in 2008 when the Clintons disposed of a holding they acquired in 2003 of Yucaipa Partnerships showing a loss of $726,761. For some details about it and their relationship to it, see this Wall Street Journal article at: http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123716092427335513 The Clinton ties to Yucaipa werent all costly. According to the 2007 tax return, Yucaipa Global Holdings paid the Clintons over $2.75 million. (The relationship between Yucaipa Global Holdings and the disposed Yucaipa Parnerships is not clear to me.) There was no income from Yucaipa during subsequent years reported on a Schedule E where one reports partnership income as had been reported in 2007. A Wikipedia article indicates that: Former U.S. President Bill Clinton , a close friend of founder Ron Burkle, was an advisor to Yucaipa. From 2003 to 2006, Bill and Hillary Clintons tax returns show total Yucaipa partnership income of $12.5 million. 3. http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/23/news/clinton-laureate-university/ 4. There are no indications on the tax returns that the Clintons invested in real estate. From 2007 through 2015, their property taxes remained around $100,000. The only exception is 2013 when it jumped to $128,098, but then went back down to $104,303 the following year.
Email Artwork from book cover | America at War with Itself Donald Trump most likely will not be elected President. Still, his historic campaign has sent shock waves through the American body politic. All are asking what it means and what it portends. The focus is on America at home rather than abroad. Foreign policy issues have been overshadowed by anxious domestic concerns. Moreover, Trump never formulated a coherent view of international issues. Like the average guy, he simply spat out whatever thoughts passed through his head as he had caught snippets of Fox news. Any attempt to discern logic and strategy from Trumps disjointed exclamations proves frustrating. Trumps entire campaign conveyed emotions rather than considered thoughts. It played to the publics feelings  amplifying them and channeling them into a turbid brew of primitive slogans. Energy was imparted through unbridled vehemence and the showmanship of the born despot. So it is those emotions that we should look at to see what is simmering behind the formal faade of our democracy in action. For they will outlast the election. Therein lies their significance for possible effects on the United States relations with the rest of the world. If there is an appropriate label to stick on this fermenting vat, it is nativism. By that we mean a rather inchoate mix of atavistic nationalism, xenophobia, aggressiveness, righteous religiosity and racism dressed up as patriotism. Deep-seated sense of grievance and pervasive feelings that the true American has been sold out provide the fuel. Each of these elements has precedents in American history and roots in American society. They periodically have surfaced in political movements from the Know-Nothings who in the 1850s were empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by German and Irish Catholic immigrants, to the paranoia that accompanied the Red Scare in the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution and then reappeared with greater intensity in the form of McCarthyism. Todays manifestations have a larger economic component. The plight of salaried workers after decades of wealth redistribution upwards, the hollowing out of the countrys industrial core, the financializing of business, and the emergence of a gig economy that promises only more dislocation, insecurity, skimpy or no benefits, and declining living standards have eroded the optimistic creed that has been the lifeblood of America. Rugged individualism dictates that individual persons should assume responsibility for their failings; stoic fatalism in the face of external forces that drain all hope is quite another matter. Blame, like discontent, is free-floating. Its locus shifts among Wall Street, Government leaders, and foreigners. The last most interests us here. Factors originating beyond the nations borders are prominent targets. They range from globalization as an abstract new reality to Benedict Arnold companies that off-shore jobs and tax liabilities to American leaders who sign away American interests in one-sided trade deals to hostile governments who are cheaters. There is more than a grain of truth in the complaints directed at all of those mentioned. The common man, as we quaintly used to call workers, indeed has been sold out by the bosses  economic and political. In truth, most of that selling out has been by elites favoring other elites here at home at the expense of the general populace. Foreigners are politically more convenient targets, though. The primary question is whether the disposition to blame external parties will manifest itself in antagonistic action. That has been the pattern elsewhere at other times. It is by no means obvious, though, that this logic holds in the case of the United States today. This is certainly true as regards any large-scale use of military force. Fifteen years of relentless, failed wars in the greater Middle East have drained the country of the passion for violence with which we retaliated for 9/11. Whether a President Clinton will expand operations in Syria is unaffected by what the American publics anger over illegal immigration or biased trade agreements. A vague distaste for ungrateful, grasping foreigners does not eclipse aversion to expensive new adventures abroad or skepticism that they will work. As to Russia, the current high decibel condemnation of Moscows alleged machinations is more an elite phenomenon, led by the security Establishment, than it is an expression of popular outrage. Few Americans identify with the Syrian rebels whom Putin is fighting or Ukrainian para-militaries burning people alive in Odessa. The negative view of Russia, and Putin personally, so assiduously cultivated by politicos and the MSM does not translate into fear or hatred. The pervasive obsession with the Red Menace that marked the Cold War remains dormant. That is even true in Europe  except for the Poles and the Baltics. Although that state of sentiment allows Washington to be rhetorically aggressive, and to take the much publicized steps of building up NATO forces around Russias periphery. However, any action that is seen as actually raising a risk of direct conflict will be rejected. Conclusion : American policy toward Russia and the Middle East will follow the tracks laid down by the Obama administration with little deviation  and no greater success. It is immigration that has been the hot button issue involving other countries. Passions are aroused by two things: the presence of millions of illegals from Mexico and Central America; and the prospect of Islamic terrorists entering the United States masquerading as refugees. The two merge at the most primitive level of emotions. Together, they deepen worries that the world is spinning out of control in ways that call into question the country they know (or imagine they know). Projections of rapidly increasing Latino populations which threaten to overwhelm school districts and voter rolls ruffle the feathers of many Middle Americans. Alarm that welfare and other social problems are siphoning off much needed public moneys in the age of austerity add a tangible economic element to these anxieties. Could this lead to implementation of the sorts of draconian ethnic cleansing programs advocated by Donald Trump? Unlikely  despite his ability to insert them into so-called mainstream discourse about the problem. It is easy to exaggerate the extent and the intensity of anti-immigrant feelings. Most Americans encounter little of it in their daily lives. Those who do in places like Texas or California pretty much take it as a given: something that should be dealt with but not a matter requiring urgent action. Arizona is different. Its the extreme Rightists and the Republican politicos whom they have intimidated into obedience who make most of the noise. Foreign observers should note that the situation here is very different from that in Western Europe. Not only is the United States a very big country where relatively large populations can get lost but, equally important, social space is not as tightly configured. Outside of small towns, there is little sense of traditional community to be protected. Americanism trumps all as the successful integration of waves of immigrants throughout the countrys history has demonstrated. While Latinos do present some unusual complications (unlike South or East Asian immigrants), visceral concerns about a denaturing of culture and society are relatively weak. (25% of all baseball players in the professional leagues are Latinos  most from abroad). Conclusion : the politics of immigration policy reform has not changed. So, the policies and unresolved dispute over what to do next will remain in their present indeterminate state. The immigration-terrorism link is a far more passionate matter. It taps the terrorism psychosis that has gripped the country since 9/11. The graphic outbreak of mass violence over the past year has rekindled feverish emotions. The fact that the Orlando/San Bernadino/NY-NJ perpetrators had some vague connection with jihadi groups in the Middle East has given these events a transnational dimension. In fact, all of the perps were American-born citizens or had grown up in the US. Logically speaking, a detached observer could infer that restrictive immigration from the region or of Muslims generally would have no bearing on the level of terrorist threat. Facts in the age of Trump have lost much of their purchase on the American mind, though. What about the economic sphere? It is there that one might reasonably expect the preoccupations of the presidential campaign to affect the policy of a new administration. Economic nationalism follows naturally from aroused popular discontents that finger the forces of globalization as a prime cause of the economic plight in which tens of millions of American find themselves. That is to say, one might anticipate that American officials will take a more searching look at the bottom-line impact of the accelerating integration of the world economy whose promotion has been a centerpiece of American foreign policy since the early 1990s  as actively and optimistically promoted by HRCs husband. The process has tremendous momentum  institutional (via the IMF, World Bank, EMU, mega-banks and MNS), political and intellectual. Economic thinking, academic and governmental, has been totally dominated by the twin market fundamentalist concepts of General Market Equilibrium Theory and benign globalization. While it has become trendy for all and sundry to make a ceremonial bow to the inequality phenomenon, it is hard to see the momentum of this juggernaut being blocked by disorganized displays of populism. Larry Summers personifies this state of affairs. One of the architects and master builders of the financialized, unregulated transnational economy who fought ruthlessly to bail out Wall Sreet at the expense of Main Street under Obama, he now punctuates his innumerable public appearances with warnings that we should attention to inequality dilemma. This homily is not a prelude to any action. Rather, it is akin to the Mafia don who devoutly crosses himself every time that his limousine crosses the path of a religious procession on a Saints Day. That is the outlook in the United States under HRC. The one exception might by the TPP and TIIP treaties. Both were crafted by elites imbued by the optimistic globalization creed, both were kept secret except for the financial and commercial interests who were participants in their drafting, and both go far beyond traditional trade matters. The former, in particular, represents a radical transference of power from national governments to private parties institutionalized in expert panels heavily biased toward the latter. Indeed, many of its provisions may be unconstitutional  as a fair-minded Supreme Court could rule. That recondite aspect of TPP did not get an airing during the campaign. However, the tying of the treaty to the damaging effects of trade treaties forced even its supporters to equivocate. Hillary Clinton had been an enthusiastic backer until Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump began to reap political hay by condemning it. She now declares that is acceptable only if significant new conditions are met. Continuity will prevail elsewhere. Americans overall will remain the insular, parochial, moralizing and largely ignorant citizens they have been. That leaves plenty of space for a foreign policy Establishment driven by a powerful inertia to add to its long string of mishaps. * Every society has its dark and dangerous undercurrents. Americas is laced with racism and fed by a deep pool of personal insecurities. The recrudescence of coarse racism, the deep psychic anxieties of the white males of Middle America, the embrace of jingoism, the frustrations of trailer park super-patriots, and the desperation of tormented Evangelicals torn over the question of whether a prospective nuclear Iran is a sign that the End Days are approaching or a serious speed-bump on the road to Rapture  together, these elements are creating an emotional maelstrom that has found an odd idol in the buffoonish persona of Donald Trump. The longer it lasts, the more attached he himself becomes to the pipe-dream of writing his name on the wind forever  and the more his followers see themselves affirmed and exalted. Finally, we have to come to terms with the dismaying truth that public opinion, in individuals and in aggregate, is only exceptionally the outcome of an informed and thoughtful process of deliberation. It is the rationalist myth that we are by nature thinking creatures inclined to viewing the world around us in an emotionally detached, mature manner. Very, very few persons approximate that model. Inherited loyalties, deep seated prejudices and preferences, private emotions, the attraction or repulsion of personality  all of these elements come into play to considerable degree. In todays society where attachments of all sorts are weak and evanescent, where political parties have little cohesion, where associational life has faded, where we are exposed to the barrage of media imagery and messaging, the rationalist model has become less and less valid. Most of us are shaped by influences that we only dimly perceive  whether calculated intent lies behind them or not.
Photo by John Duffy | CC BY 2.0 Three nights ago, 19.37 million television viewers watched the opening game of North American professional baseballs so-called World Series pitting the Chicago Cubs against the Cleveland Indians (the latter team won 6-0). I made it through the second inning before I had to switch to radio out of disgust at the Indians jersey and ball-cap team logo  a wild grinning Native American caricature best understood as a modern-day Red Sambo. Its bad enough that the Cleveland team retains (well into the 21 st century) the name the Indians. First Nations people (the Canadian term) in the United States are more properly called Native or Indigenous Americans  not a name imposed on them by white conquerors who mistakenly thought theyd discovered the Indes.  But the logo is really beyond the pale . Imagine a team called The Baltimore Blacks or The New Jersey Negroes, with a ball-cap showing a racist caricature of a Black Sambo. Or imagine a German football (soccer) team named the Buchenwald Semites  or an Austrian team named the Vienna Hebrews  with a jersey bearing the crudely exaggerated caricature image of an old stereotypically hook-nosed Jewish man. That would be unthinkable in Holocaust-haunted Germany, of course. Native Americans suffered their own Holocaust on the lands that were swallowed up as the United States. By some estimates more than 15 million First Nations people inhabited North America (most of them on land later seized as U.S. territory) before Columbus. Thanks to white-imposed disease, displacement, eco-cide, and murder, the number of Indians alive in the United States fell to less than 250,000 by 1890. But team names bearing images and/or names of Indigenous people who experienced genocide  the Washington Redskins (yes, redskins, which the Black comic Chris Rock once analogized to naming a team The New York Niggers), the Cleveland Indians, the Atlanta Braves, the Chicago Blackhawks (named after a famous Sauk Nation warrior whose tribe members were butchered en masse by Andrew Jacksons U.S. Army), the Kansas City Chiefs, the Fighting Illini, the Florida State Seminoles, etc.  live on with impunity in the U.S. Meanwhile, up in the northern Great Plains, predominantly white and heavily militarized local and state police are attacking the civil rights and bodies of Indigenous people fighting heroically to help humanity (including the mostly white folks watching the World Series) avert environmental catastrophe. The remarkable prayer, protest, and resistance camp set up by North Dakotas Standing Rock Sioux tribe is dedicated to blocking Energy Transfer Partners eco-cidal Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The pipeline is a giant black snake being laid to carry 470,000 barrels of hydraulically fractured (fracked) crude oil daily from the North Dakota Bakken oil field under and near the Missouri River (under twice), the Mississippi (under once), and numerous other streams, lakes, rivers, and aquifers. The Standing Rock resistance camp has at various times in recent months swelled to accommodate more than five thousand water protectors who are also air and climate protectors. It has garnered support and participation from more than 300 Native American tribes, making it the greatest example of inter-tribal solidarity in two centuries (since the time of Tecumseh) of U.S. history. And now  behind the scenes of the World Series and the seemingly endless quadrennial presidential electoral extravaganza  it is under vicious military-style attack. As Sarah Lazare reports on AlterNet : Military-style checkpoints. Low-flying surveillance planes. Invasive strip searches. These are just some of the repression tactics that have targeted the thousands of Indigenous people and supporters who, heeding the call of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, mobilized to North Dakota to stop the DAPL On Saturday [October 22 nd ], 127 water protectors were arrested at a march by police in riot gear, some of whom carried assault rifles, and multiple reports of violence have emerged, including forced strip searches. What happened on Saturday was completely uncalled for, out ofout of the realm of any understanding of people who are trying to do something good and right, [said] Sacheen Seitcham, an organizer with the West Coast Women Warriors Media Cooperative  The intrepid Native American journalist Brenda Norrell and other writers at Censored News report that Morton County (North Dakota) police are criminally torturing Native American activists, placing hoods over the heads of arrestees, water boarding hooded prisoners , and forcing at least one young woman to remain naked in jail cell for an entire night. Cody Hall of the Cheyanne River Indian Reservation in South Dakota told Lazre that Nobody is telling the real story of whats coming out of these camps, why were doing this Our overall goal, Hall added, is that this pipeline is not built. Our overall goal is to protect people, protect the human race Were protecting future generations. Indeed, Earth scientists across the world are urgently warning humanity and the predominantly white economic and power elites who control global and U.S. energy policy that fossil fuels must be kept in the ground and replaced with renewable energy sources as a soon as possible if homo sapiens wants to avoid ever more imminent ecosystem collapse . It is a good moment for Americans of all races and ethnic and national origins to shift their attention away from the infantilizing mass spectator pageants of our corporate-mediated times  be they World Series games or quadrennial major party electoral carnivals. (You can put the game on the radio while organizing financial support for the Standing Rock water and climate protectors. And it takes about ten minutes to vote early, if you really think that matters ). Its a good time to glean some existentially imperative wisdom and inspiration from the likes of Cody Hall. Hall and thousands of other Indigenous water and climate protectors and their multiracial allies within and beyond North Dakota (mostly white Iowa activists have been waging an also-heroic and under-appreciated struggle against the DAPL at the Mississippi Stand camp in Southeastern Iowa ) are trying in their own highly focused way to draw a line in the soil of the Great Plains against petro-capitalisms relentless project of Greenhouse Gassing life on Earth to death  a crime that will make the Nazis and Columbus look almost like amateur criminals . Cody Hall and Sacheen Seitcham and the many thousands of other Indigenous Americans fighting the DAPL are descended from the continents original inhabitants. They are connected thereby to an Indigenous and pre-capitalist culture from whom Euro-Americans could learn a great deal. As the Native American author and activist Ward Churchill wrote two decades ago: On the day Christopher Columbus first washed up on a Caribbean beach, North America was long since endowed with an abundant and exceedingly complex cluster of civilizations. Having continuously occupied the continent for at least 50,000 years, the native inhabitants evidenced a total population of perhaps 15 million, cities as large as the 40,000-resident urban center at Cahokia (in present-day Illinois), highly advanced conceptions of architecture and engineering, spiritual traditions embodying equivalents to modern ecoscience, refined knowledge of pharmacology and holistic medicine, and highly sophisticated systems of governance, trade, and diplomacy. The traditional economies of the continent were primarily agricultural, based in environmentally sound farming procedures which originated well over half the vegetal foodstuffs now consumed by peoples the world over. By and large, the indigenous societies demonstrating such attainments were organized along extremely egalitarian lines, with real property held collectively and matrifocality a normative standard. War in the Euro-derived sense in which the term is understood today, was unknown. Also unknown was economic inequality and poverty on anything remotely like the scale of early modern Europe, which gestated the capitalist order that would spill its vicious surplus onto North American territory including what would become the United States  a nation where the top tenth of the top One Percent currently owns nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Pre-Conquest North American civilization was comprised of what Churchill described as large-scale societies which had perfected ways of organizing themselves into psychologically fulfilling wholes, experiencing very high standards of living, and still maintaining environmental harmony   (W. Churchill, From a Native Son: Essays on Indigenism 1985-1995 , South End Press, 1996, emphasis added). Such were the remarkable, inter-connected social and cultural attainments of North Americans Indigenous people and nations, who are cruelly mocked as quaint and amusing savages from a bygone frontier era in the names and logos worn by U.S. sports teams. As the top national media spectacle shifts from the World Series to the final days of the noxious Trump-Hillary election carnival, reflect on this great accomplishment of so-called Western Civilization: in the three presidential debates between the two widely hated major party contestants, the media moderators did not ask or relay a single, solitary question about climate change  the single greatest issue of our or any time . Not one question . It is quite literally unreal. (And note the absurdity of North American white-capitalist-owned baseballs penultimate games being played during the evening and in the cool and even cold temperatures of the middle Fall season. Baseball is a summer game, meant to played in warmth, but commercial considerations dictate that profit trumps basic natural, Earth-conscious, environmentally grounded intelligence when it comes to when Major League Baseball and the all-powerful corporate media schedule the games. The continents First Nations people would never be so foolish as that.) Meanwhile thousands of predominantly Native American activists (proud heirs of the people taunted and lampooned by the name and gear of the Cleveland baseball team). are giving their answer at the top of the U.S. heartland: fossil fuels must stay in the ground if our children and grandchildren and out other relatives  the other living things of the world  are going to be able to enjoy a decent future. And for having the courage to draw this line in the sands of time and place, an untold number of these Indigenous heroes are now being strip-searched, caged, left naked in cells, hooded, and water-boarded (all these practices fall under the category of torture in the U.S. Army Manual) by militarized white police, heirs of those who committed the North American genocide.
Home | World |   By Cluck Clan 09/11/2016 07:35:08   can thank eight years of Obama rule, which has most certainly lost Hillary Clinton the U.S. election. Socialists in America have had their day, all the Marxists and Communists within the Democrat party have torn the country apart. Eight long burdensome years of Obama, overspending on socialist pet projects, controlling, politically correct, gays, feminists, transexuals, inhibiting free speech, encouraging global chaos and people have had enough. One can only hope that Black Lives Matter is buried under deep concrete never to be seen again, all the SJWs are taken out into the streets and beaten with bats, and the politically correct morons are told to shut the fuck up once and for all. The silent Americans seething for eight long years fought back, and to vote for someone like Trump was a breath of fresh air even though in an act of defiance against the whole system of corruption. As one maverick to another, there can only be an element of respect given to Trump, who just did not give a fuck, and has in one night buried eight years of hell under Obama, possibly the worst president of the United States ever encountered. It has to be said that eight years of blackness has ended, and we can all breathe a breath of fresh air and light, albeit with major uncertainties. Under Trump there will be war with China, there will be economic hell, and there will be upheaval but anything is better than more Obama or socialists. Trump has just grabbed the world by the pussy. Share on : Tua Pui Poh Yes. Finally, America can be GREAT AGAIN under TRUMP who would trump, triumph and fires those unfit to represent the silent majority people in America! I can be proud of America once again all the way from Belgium!
11 Stupid Things Vox.com's Matthew Yglesias Has Said By: Aaron Bandler October 26, 2016 Matt Yglesias of Vox has always been a gold mine of comedy fodder, given his penchant for saying things that are mind-bogglingly asinine. Apparently Yglesias agrees with this sentiment: Matt Yglesias deleted something like 30,000 tweets yesterday. Clearly a man proud of his history of astute analysis and voxplanations. Fortunately, the Internet is forever and all of the stupid things that Yglesias has said can still be found and mocked mercilessly. Here are 11 things Yglesias has said that are incredibly dumb. 1. Yglesias was convinced that people would love Obamacare. That is, until he didn't: . @mattyglesias Obamacare marker - which was solid as of 15 minutes ago - appears to no longer be markering pic.twitter.com/a0EyXImI8g  Omri Ceren (@cerenomri) October 26, 2016 His 2013 piece is still available though, and in it he whines about how supposedly "the media, for non-ideological reasons, is just massively biased toward negativity about this kind of thing." Yglesias also links to another piece of his in which he claimed that "when Obamacare becomes the status quo, people will still be happy with the status quo quo and easy to frighten." In other words, Yglesias felt that the plebs would eventually succumb to his way of thinking. That all fell by the wayside when the Obama administration admitted that premiums were set to increase by an average of 25 percent. 2. Yglesias made a racist comment toward former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R). In a 2013 tweet that is now deleted, Yglesias wrote, "Is Bobby Jindals reputation for intelligence anything other than ethnic stereotyping?" Yglesias doubled down on his nasty comment when he received backlash, tweeting: "Oh, fun. Conservative twitter is in bogus outrage mode." Eventually, Yglesias backed down, tweeting: "For the record, now that I know more about Jindals life its clear that hes a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff." The irony of Yglesias saying this was not lost on Twitter: Good thing you don't say dumb stuff. MT @mattyglesias Its clear that Jindals a very smart man who just says lots of very dumb stuff.  jon gabriel (@exjon) June 18, 2013 3. Yglesias once ranted against "dumb Jewish politicians." The leftist pundit wrote a ThinkProgress piece in 2009 that was seriously titled "Dumb Jewish Politicians," in which Yglesias highlighted a passage from Jonathan Chait, who wrote in the New Republic that then-Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT) had to be stupid for not supporting the public option. "I suspect that Lieberman is the beneficiary, or possibly the victim, of a cultural stereotype that Jews are smart and good with numbers," Chait wrote. "Trust me, its not true. If Senator Smith from Idaho was angering Democrats by spewing uninformed platitudes, most liberals would deride him as an idiot. With Lieberman, we all suspect its part of a plan. I think he just has no idea what hes talking about and doesnt care to learn" Yglesias agreed: Ive long held a related theory about Eric Cantor. Anyways, this reminds me that at a meeting this morning I pitched the idea of trying to do health reform in a secret Christmas morning session that only Jewish Senators would attend. Theres a whole bunch  Boxer, Cardin, Feingold, Feinstein, Franken, Kohl, Lautenberg, Levin, Lieberman, Sanders, Schumer, Specter, and Wyden. Its a very progressive bunch and Lieberman could easily be outvoted 4. Yglesias advocated for ending time zones. Seriously. In what was a typical example of Vox being a waste of space, Yglesias wrote a 2014 piece titled "The case against time zones: They're impractical & outdated." Yglesias pontificated: Northern Idaho is connected via I-90 to Spokane and Seattle to its west, but not to Boise to its south so the Couer d'Alene area is on Pacific Time rather than Mountain Time. India has broken with the general scheme and adopted a half-hour staggered time zone so as to place the entire country on one time. Yet while these zig-zags and 30-minute zones destroy the pristine geometry of railroad time, they serve a very practical purpose. It is genuinely annoying to schedule meetings, calls, and other arrangements across time zones. The need to constantly specify which time zone you're talking about is a drag. Commuting across time zones would be more annoying still, which is why the suburbs of Chicago that are located in Indiana use Illinois' Central Time rather than Indianapolis' Eastern Time. But the ultimate solution to this problem is not a lot of ad hoc deviations. It's to shift the world to one giant time zone. Ygleasias then called for "One time to rule them all"a phrase that prompted J.R.R. Tolkien to weep in his graveand then wrote this doozy: If the whole world used a single GMT-based time, schedules would still vary. In general most people would sleep when it's dark out and work when it's light out. So at 23:00, most of London would be at home or in bed and most of Los Angeles would be at the office. But of course London's bartenders would probably be at work while some shift workers in LA would be grabbing a nap. The difference from today is that if you were putting together a London-LA conference call at 21:00 there'd be only one possible interpretation of the proposal. A flight that leaves New York at 14:00 and lands in Paris at 20:00 is a six-hour flight, with no need to keep track of time zones. If your appointment is in El Paso at 11:30 you don't need to remember that it's in a different time zone than the rest of Texas. Pejman Yousefzadeh explained just how stupid Yglesias's time zone piece was, writing at Ricochet : "I grant you that there are times when confusion does take place, but seriously, who cares? Is befuddlement regarding time zones really such a pressing issue that Matthew Yglesias has to take to writing an article demanding that we abolish them? Dont the people at Vox have anything better to write about?" Apparently they don't. 5. Yglesias doesn't understand Florida's geography very well. Yglesias wrote a short blurb in The Atlantic in 2007, in which he began thinking aloud about the city of Miami. "I'd been interested to know what, if anything, is legally or practically preventing the city from just expanding further and further west if anyone happens to know," Yglesias said. People immediately pointed the obvious answer: Miami couldn't do so because there was this thing called a swampmost of which is The Everglades National Parkcausing such development to be difficult to accomplish. "Yes, yes, commenters I know it's a freaking swamp but there's plenty of development on ex-swampland in Florida -- hence all the canals and weird-looking lakes," an exasperated Yglesias wrote in an update. Except that the land is not "ex-swampland," it's an actual swamp . Maybe Yglesias shouldn't write a blurb that involves him thinking aloud. 6. Yglesias thinks that lying is perfectly fine...if you're a politician. Yglesias found himself getting smacked around on Twitter after he advocated for high-speed rail advocates to provide an "unrealistically optimistic" projection about the number of riders that will use the boondoggle program to obtain funding from the government. "For better or for worse, thats politics," Yglesias wrote at ThinkProgress . On Twitter, Yglesias attempted to justify it by writing: "Fighting dishonesty with dishonesty is sometimes the right thing for advocates to do, yes." And yet, Yglesias had the temerity to accuse journalist Eli Lake of being dishonest on Twitter. Yglesias must have realized how badly he put himself in a Catch-22 when he told the Daily Caller to "go f*** yourself" when they tried to interview him about the Twitter incident. 7. Yglesias once hailed the Department of Veteran Affairs as a healthcare model the country should emulate. The Federalist 's Sean Davis pointed to Yglesias writing in 2009 that the VA was "producing the highest quality care in the country. Their turnaround points the way toward solving Americas health-care crisis." Yglesias also tweeted at GOP chairman Reince Priebus in 2013, "Will @Reince be explaining the evils of socialized medicine to veterans?" This tweet was also deleted, and for good reason, since the VA has caused 307,000 veteran deaths due to "systemic" problems with the agency. 8. Yglesias doesn't understand the purpose of the Senate. Yglesias wrote the following for ThinkProgress in 2009, per the Guardian : If you add together the two Republican Senators from Wyoming with the one from Alaska, one from South Dakota, one from New Hampshire, two from Maine, two from Idaho, two from Nebraska, one from Nevada, two from Utah, two from Kansas, two from Mississippi, one from Iowa, two from Oklahoma, two from Kentucky, one from Louisiana, two from South Carolina, and two from Alabama, the 28 of them collectively represent (on a system in which you attribute half the population of a given state to a senator) 11.98 percent of the American population. Meanwhile, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein together represent 11.95 percent of the American population. Now of course Texas is also a big state (though at 7.81 percent of the population it's a lot smaller than California) and there are small states (like Vermont and North Dakota) that have two Democratic Senators. So the point here isn't a narrowly partisan one, though the wacky apportionment of the Senate does have a partisan valence. The point is that this is an unfair and bizarre way to run things. If you consider that the mean state would contain two percent of the population, we have just 34 Senators representing the above-average states even though they collectively contain 69.15 percent of the population. The other 66 Senators represent about 30 percent of the people. If the Iranians were to succeed in overthrowing their theocracy and set about to write a new constitution, nobody in their right mind would recommend this system to them. In three paragraphs of rambling, incoherent nonsense, Yglesias missed the fact that the purpose of having two senators representing each state was so states with smaller populations would be properly represented and not have their interests swallowed up by states with larger populations. 9. Yglesias doesn't understand America's financial system. Yglesias showed his ignorance of the issue when he wrote in a 2013 Slate column that there were "far far far too many banks" in the country, as there were 6,891 at the time. Yglesias bloviated that all these small banks were somehow dangerous: 1. They are poorly managed: You know how the best and brightest of Wall Street royally screw up sometimes? This doesn't get better when you drill down to the less-bright and not-as-good guys. It gets worse. And since small banks finance themselves almost entirely with loans from FDIC-ensured depositors, nobody is watching the store. In effect, the well-managed banks are being taxed to subsidize the poorly managed ones. The dubious decision-making doesn't get as complicated as what you see on Wall Streetit's mostly just classic boom-and-bust pro-cyclical commercial real estate loansbut it creates all the same problems. 2. They can't be regulated: Since these banks are so small, they could be easily driven out of business by high regulatory compliance costs. So since American public policy is perversely committed to preserving them, small banks regularly get various kinds of carve-outs from regulations. And once the carve-outs exist, they create pressure for extension further up the food chain. Other times the compliance issues of small firms become a reason to simply not do tight regulation. 3. They can't compete: If you want the JPMorgan Chases and Bank of Americas of the world to be held to account, you need both regulation and competition. But a bank serving a handful of rural counties or a single midsized city doesn't offer any real competition. Having a large share of America's banking sector tied up in tiny firms only makes it easier for a handful of big boys to monopolize big-time finance. Davis debunked Yglesias's argument, which was devoid of citations and falsely claimed that there haven't been any new banks formed in recent years (there were at least four in 2013.) "Yglesias' arguments are so poorly reasoned and so poorly supported that it leads one to question whether his post was thoughtlessly regurgitated from anti-community bank talking points promoted by the big banks ('You guys, the Wall Street banks that nearly destroyed America arent the problem. Small community banks where bankers actually know the borrowers are the real problem. Dont worry about the facts. Just go with it.')," Davis wrote in The Federalist . "I'm actually at a loss to come up with a more charitable explanation." 10. Yglesias thinks that black conservatives are a recent phenomenon. After reading a review of a Booker T. Washington biography, Yglesias started thinking about "'black conservative' political tradition," prompting him to write in a 2009 ThinkProgress post, "It's only extremely recently that the idea of an African-American aligning himself,  la Clarence Thomas, with the mainstream conservative movement in America could be remotely possible. But even so, that didnt mean there was no ideological conflict in black politics or that general rightist sentiments somehow didnt exist." This is patently false, as Damon Root explained in Reason : Actually, the great Harlem Renaissance author and journalist George Schuylerwho was known as the black H.L. Menckenpublished general rightist sentiments long before Clarence Thomas came on the scene, including Schuylers unambiguously titled 1966 autobiography Black and Conservative. And the celebrated novelist and folklorist Zora Neale Hurston both endorsed conservative Sen. Robert A. Taft in the 1952 presidential election and repeatedly attacked FDRs New Deal... 11. Yglesias expressed joy when Andrew Breitbart died. Following Breitbart's death, Yglesias tweeted : "Conventions around dead people are ridiculous. The world outlook is slightly improved with @AndrewBrietbart [sic] dead." This tweet has also been deleted, and for good reasoncelebrating the death of someone just because of political differences is worse than stupid, it's ghoulish, vile and reprehensible. And Slate defended Yglesias, stating that he "is a very passionate journalist and Slate values that passion." Apparently Slate believes that "passion" trumps basic human decency and a reasonable IQ level, and Yglesias certainly does not possess the latter two qualities.
SNOWFLAKE: Colbert Didnt Want To Write Jokes About Trump Winning By: Hank Berrien November 21, 2016 Conversing with fellow Daily Show comic John Oliver at the Montclair Film Festival on Saturday night, Late Show unfunny host Stephen Colbert admitted that he couldnt even conceive that Donald trump would win the presidency; so much so that he couldnt write jokes bout Trump winning for election night. In the roughly two-hour discussion and Q&A titled Wow, That Was Weird, Montclair Film Festival executive director Tom Hall set the somber tone by allowing, "When we planned this evening, I think we all thought we'd be looking back with laughter instead of looking forward with deep concern about the uncertainty we face." Speaking of the Late Show s Election Night special on Showtime, Colbert admitted that the staff was prepared for every result of the election except the one that actually transpired: There was not a bear big enough in the world that we weren't loaded for. We were so loaded for every possible eventuality. We had so many guests. We had so many pre-taped pieces, all based on a different eventuality. We had three shows: Hillary Clinton wins and we know; Hillary Clinton wins and we dont know, because its not called before the shows over; Donald Trump's going to win and we dont know, because everyone said he had such a narrow path to victory. That's not wishful thinking, that's what everyone was saying. And then there was the last show, which is the show we did, which is Donald Trump is going to win and we know he's going to win. My execs and my writers were like, You don't want to write something for that? and I'm like, No! There is nothing you can write. You don't understand. I have 400 people in my theater. If we know Donald Trump is going to win, it's going to be like doing stand-up comedy for one of those Chilean soccer stadiums where the villagers watch you execute one of the natives. There will be no laughter! We only did about 20 minutes of material before we went, F it, it's going to be him, let's just talk for another hour. So I think we have two and a half whole shows that you will never see of material that we had to kill that night. Colbert moaned that the special was "the hardest thing I've ever done in my life," adding, "I was tying my tie at 10:30 and I went, 'Oh, he took Ohio. Oh, well, we expected that. He took it by 11 points. Wow! That's not expected.' And then over my guests' shoulders, people kept holding up signs that said, 'Florida, Iowa, Nebraska.'" He revealed that numerous fake commercials were prepared, but "none of them were appropriate once we knew we were playing to an audience of the condemned. Our audience was sobbing openly. And those are people who work for me, like my cameramen." As Daily Wire Editor-in-Chief Ben Shapiro pointed out years ago , Colbert's manipulative act has been laced with hatred of conservatives: He engages in Conservativeface. He needs no makeup or bulbous appendage to play a conservative  after all, conservatives come in every shape and size. Instead, he acts as though he is a conservative  an idiotic, racist, sexist, bigoted, brutal conservative. He out-Archie Bunkers Archie Bunker. His audience laughs and scoffs at brutal religious Colbert who wishes to persecute gays; they chortle at evil sexist Colbert who thinks men are victims of sexism. This is the purpose of Colberts routine. His show is about pure hatred for conservatives in the same way that blackface was about pure hatred of blacks. In order to justify their racism, racists had to create a false perception of blacks; in the same way, Colbert and his audience can justify their racism only by creating a false perception of conservatives. On Saturday night, Colbert waxed eloquent over his fear of a Trump presidency, arguing, "Im all for giving him a chance, but dont give him an inch. Because I believed everything he said, and I remember everything he said. And its horrifying. It's possible. The job changes a man. That's the cliche of the presidency." He pontificated: Every president tries to achieve what they promised and you can say, Well, there are levers of power in Washington that can slow him down. But two things: One is they're cowards. Second is that the levers in Washington are apparently merely attached to blinking red lights that make the people happy when they pull. Because they tried to stop Trump. Everybody tried to stop Trump, do not delude yourself. Everyone except the people he's going to appoint tried to stop him and they didn't. He owes them nothing. He goes out on the balcony and he says to the crowd, Shall I do it? And they say, 'Yes. And he says, It shall be so. And the balcony is Twitter. He goes onto Twitter and he goes, What do you think? Do you think I'm right? That's what scares me, that he owes the checks and balances of Washington nothing because they tried to stop him and they couldn't. And he's a vindictive person. So it's all going to be fine. Merry Christmas. No! There is nothing you can write." Stephen Colbert Colbert concluded, "The next person who says to me, 'You must be happy on a certain level, is going to have their eye carved out. So thats the man underneath the comedy mask . . .
Political analyst of the Daily Mail Introduced by Lasha Darkmoon with additional comments (includes historic 20-minute video) Most European leaders can barely bring themselves to look at him.  Dominic Sandbrook LASHA DARKMOONS INTRODUCTION : Only yesterday an esteemed political commentator on my site had these prophetic words to say: Whoever wins, its going to be a shock to end all shocks. Half of America will be shocked by jubilant rapture, the other half by black despair. Ive never know any other election like this. Like so any others who have ended up with egg on their faces, the same commentator had confidently predicted a victory for Hillary Clinton. These false prophets, among whom we can number the author of this present article, Dominic Sandbrook, were convinced that Hillary Clinton would soon be installed in the White House. Here is what our esteemed commentator told us yesterday. How hollow and even ridiculous his words sound today! I quote them only because they are so typical. Listen buddies, you are my online friends and I hope youre all gonna be made very happy tomorrow morning as Trump becomes the new Augustus of Pax Americana . But I have this sinking feeling in my gut that it aint gonna happen. Hillary is gonna win because all the cards are stacked in her favor. Remember this, even if 70% of Americans vote for Trump, those Diebold voting machines are gonna turn real nasty and start spitting out fire and devil smoke. And its gonna be Crazy Hillary and rapist Hubby Bill waltzing into the White House and up the gallery stairs into the hot tub on the top floor, with assorted nymphettes simpering among the bubbles and going Oooh! . . . Ahhh! . . . take it easy sir, Im only a Girl Scout! Ya cant make this up.Silly words? Obviously. If Id said them myself, Id now be blushing with shame for making such a fool of myself. The fact is, we have all made fools of ourselves, not least the Republican Party that took the unprecedented step of disowning their own candidate, Donald Trump, and giving their support to his Democratic competitor Hillary Clinton. Here was a man, they alleged shamefully, who was was in the pocket of Vladimir Putin and took orders from the Kremlin. He was closer to the Kremlin than he was to Nato. If America elected this man, they spluttered, the trump of doom no pun intendedwould soon be reverberating from Washington to Vladivostok. The man they spat upon and denigrated so treacherously is now their boss. Lets hope he punishes them. Lets hope he puts Hillary behind bars, as he promised . If he now does a U-turn and cuddles up to the Establishment, and if his first trip abroad is to Tel Aviv, his millions of supporters will know they have been cruelly betrayed. Just as Tony Blair betrayed Britain, turning into one of the greatest liars and war criminals in British history, it remains to be seen if Trump is not going to do a similar U-turn by cuddling up to the enemies of America: to the Rothschilds and Soroses and Adelsons and the neoconservative warmongers who put Israel before America and pay regular visits to the Wailing Wall. And so we come now to this prophetic article by Dominic Sandbrook, political sage of the Daily Mail . I wish it were satire. It is not. It is written, three days before the election on November 5, with a straight face. Fasten your seat belts, dear readers, and get ready for a good laugh. Here is the mainstream media at its most fatuous and farcical, spewing forth imbecilities for the semi-moronic masses. Oh, how sad! and how deeply sobering. [LD] WHAT IF TRUMP DID WIN? by Dominic Sandbrook The 45th President of the United States reached his 1,000th day in office yesterday, and he marked it in characteristic style. Rising shortly before lunch, the most powerful man in the world took a congratulatory phone call from his closest ally, Russias Vladimir Putin, before strolling into the White House Rose Garden, where a group of swimwear models were waiting with an enormous white and gold cake. Thank you, Mr President, they chorused, for making America great again! If the impromptu party was overshadowed by the chanting of thousands of protesters outside the perimeter, the President showed no sign of being particularly worried. Take care of them, he told the head of his Russian bodyguard, who had replaced the Secret Service a few months ago. Then he nodded meaningfully at the models: Ill see you girls later . . . According to his spokesman, the President spent the afternoon closeted with his advisers in a private suite at his wife Melanias $1,000-an-hour spa (formerly the White Houses East Wing), discussing the opening of his Senate impeachment trial in a few days time. Then he retired for the evening with some of his closest confidants, among them the actor Charlie Sheen, the former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and the ex-wrestler Hulk Hogan. To look at the Presidents beaming, orange-skinned face, you would hardly know that Washington is in meltdown, that he faces multiple congressional investigations into his finances and that, every day, rival mobs of demonstrators do battle only steps from the White House. Nor would you know that the American economy is in deep recession, its cities are ablaze after months of race riots, an undeclared war is raging on the Mexican border and a nuclear conflict now seems inevitable in the Pacific. Never has the gap between image and reality been greater. Never has the worlds greatest republic plunged to such depths. But then what did you expect from President Donald Trump? The trouble started within moments of Mr Trumps unexpected comeback victory in the election of Tuesday, November 8, 2016, when riots broke out in several cities, including Chicago, Boston, Miami and Los Angeles. Thousands of buildings were burned, but the new president-elect nevertheless maintained that it had been the greatest night in American history: The greatest. Period. In his victory speech he broke with the traditional courtesies by openly pouring scorn on his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton (a major-league loser), and promising his supporters that Crooked Hillary would shortly be facing a long stretch in jail. LD : Wrong! See the 20-minute video below in which Trump, doing his first apparent U-turn, lavishes words of praise on Hillary and tells Americans how grateful they should be to her for all her hard work and dedication. So what happened to all that talk of putting her behind bars? In fact, Mrs Clinton remains very much at large. Even though President Trump insisted that her criminal conviction would be one of his chief priorities, and immediately appointed a special prosecutor with a brief to investigate her activities dating back to the Seventies, the FBI are reportedly still trawling through thousands of emails, having unearthed yet another tranche last month. There were more signs of the new era, meanwhile, at his inauguration ceremony in January 2017, when Mr Trump appeared on the stage waving his Make America Great Again baseball cap, in front of a mock-classical faade in which his own surname was spelled out in gigantic, diamond-studded letters. Unusually, the 45th President broke with precedent by refusing to deliver a prepared speech, preferring to speak from the heart, as he put it. Returning to some familiar themes, he told his audience that his predecessor, Barack Obama, was a terrorist and a Muslim, that most Mexicans were rapists and murderers, that China was in for a shock and that Nato was a complete waste of time and money. Most foreign leaders were appalled. But one man who clearly approved was Vladimir Putin, who had been the first head of state to telephone his congratulations to the new president-elect. After only two weeks in office, Mr Trump rewarded his new friend by making his first overseas trip to Moscow, where he assured the press that Mr Putin couldnt have been nicer and promised that under his administration, the Russians would be our number one ally. Number One. I mean that. LD : It remains to be seen whether Trumps first trip abroad is to Moscow or Tel Aviv. That would be the litmus test. His European tour later in 2017, however, was a disaster. After Mr Trump was recorded making remarks about Germanys Angela Merkel that cannot be repeated in a family newspaper, he moved on to London, where he told Theresa May that she had a massive Muslim problem and urged her to redevelop Chequers as a high-end golf course. Today, the American republics reputation in the world has never been lower. Even at the United Nations it has become a laughing stock, especially after Mr Trumps UN ambassador, Sarah Palin, gave a speech in which she confused Iraq and Iran, suggested Africa was a single country and joked about dropping a nuclear bomb on Saudi Arabia. On the U.S.-Mexican border, however, things have gone well beyond a joke. Work on what Mr Trump calls his Great Wall began within days of his inauguration, though it is unlikely to be finished before he leaves office and will reportedly cost at least $25 billion. After a series of sabotage attacks by Mexican protesters in mid-2018, Mr Trump abruptly lost patience and ordered the U.S. Marines to cross the border and occupy a strip some ten miles deep  which prompted the Mexican government to move its own troops to within a mile or two of the U.S. incursion. As yet, the two sides have merely skirmished, though the death toll currently stands at almost 400  a figure that would have been unthinkable three years ago. It would take only one incident, one clash that gets completely out of hand, to trigger a full-scale war. At home, meanwhile, Mr Trumps authoritarian measures, such as his shambolic and callous attempt to deport 11 million undocumented migrants, have provoked outrage. The summer of 2018 was marked by weeks of rioting in many major cities, while the Presidents insistence on declaring the Left-wing activist group Black Lives Matter a terrorist organisation sparked huge protests on campuses across the nation. It was at this point that Congress, already enraged by Mr Trumps reliance on high-handed and arguably unconstitutional executive orders, began discussing impeachment proceedings against the President. But of course, this only enraged his loyal supporters, who maintain that he is the innocent victim of a conspiracy masterminded by Barack Obama, the Clintons and the American media. Mr Trump himself remains remarkably unruffled by the prospect of impeachment, though some experts claim his famously unearthly hair is a lot thinner than it used to be. He maintains his Congressional critics are crooks and liars, and has made extraordinarily insulting remarks about the potency and masculinity of both the Democratic leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, and the Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Recently, Mr Trumps attacks on Congress have reached new heights. He now appears to believe that many leading politicians, both Democratic and Republican, have secretly converted to Islam. How do we know that the Bushes arent Muslims? he demanded last week. Why else were they so keen on going to Iraq? Genuine Muslims, however, have no place in Mr Trumps America. He made that very clear within hours of taking the oath of office, when he signed an emergency executive order banning any Muslims from entering the United States. Since he became President 1,000 days ago, attacks on Muslim Americans, including men and women who have worn their nations uniform, have reportedly increased tenfold. There have been arson attacks on mosques in Boston, New York, Chicago and Detroit, all of which Mr Trump refused point-blank to visit afterwards. All of this has naturally put him at odds with Americas traditional Nato allies. But Mr Trumps disregard for Nato was well-known even before he took office. Most European leaders can barely bring themselves to look at him. Theresa May has reportedly not even said a word to him for more than a year. But as Mr Trump is fond of reminding people, small-time countries such as Britain and Germany are finished. My friend Vladimir, he says smugly, is the strongest man in the world. Apart from myself, obviously. As it happens, the Russian President is scheduled to fly into Washington next week to express his solidarity at the beginning of his friends formal trial in the Senate. As usual, Putin is likely to arrive with a large military entourage, many of whom are expected to stay on in the U.S. capital as additional security for his beleaguered ally. As Mr Trump remarked last week, he has already arranged a suitable welcoming committee of young American female interns for his Russian counterpart. All gorgeous, he said proudly. I just start kissing them . . . and when youre a president, they let you do it, you can do anything. I cant stop kissing them. When youre a president, you can do anything ! Those last words have been something of a motto for Mr Trump. Since his election as President, he has indeed done anything he wants. The result, however, has not merely tarnished forever the image of the Presidency, driven the American economy into recession and destroyed relations between religions and races. It has shattered the Western alliance, allowed Vladimir Putin to rebuild the Soviet empire and left the United States on the brink of nuclear war with the worlds most populous country. Yet even as American cities burn and Congress attempts to drive him from office, Mr Trump remains undaunted. HISTORIC  TRUMPS VICTORY SPEECH VIDEO : 20 mins
 Please scroll down for video They call it The Hum,' a phrase coined by the geoscientist David Deming of the University of Oklahoma to describe the mysterious and untraceable sound that is heard in certain locations around the world by two to ten percent of the population.' The noises might vary from roaring sounds in the middle of the night, to prolonged periods of noise which sound like intense industrial activity taking place in the sky. Most unusually of all, ordinary people in cities such as York in England have claimed to hear trumpet horns coming from the sky playing chilling bars of music. Strange noises heard over the sky in Slovakia Now Slovakia has become the latest location to these bizarre and completely inexplicable noises, which have been recorded on video. As of yet, no one has been able to offer a completely coherent explanation for these mysterious sounds. Some have suggested that the chilling noises might be caused by changes in the Earths core which could eventually lead to a complete polar shift. However, aside from speculation, there is little evidence to suggest that this particular theory is true. According to Deming, they may well be caused by enormous amounts of collated feedback from telephone transmissions and aircraft which are operated by the United States Navy to communicate with submarines. However, this explanation is deemed to fall short as these noises became particularly apparent in 2011 and 2012 and if Deming is correct, there should have been previous indications of this feedback reaction before this period . Some people have suggested that the noise could be being caused by projects such as the HAARP weapons program, which is believed to be dedicated to working on high-tech weather modification technology. If this explanation is correct, it could not explain not only the unusual noises but also why they are so often accompanied by a bizarre phenomenon in the sky, such as those which have been detected in Slovakia in recent months.

Email Print It has been revealed that there are about 650,000 emails on Huma Abedins husbands laptop. Of the 650,000 emails, thousands are labeled classified National Security material forwarded from another email server. According to sources, the emails were discovered in a folder labeled, Life Insurance. Is it possible the folder was mislabeled by Abedin to deliberately conceal its contents? This also begs the question: How did Huma Abedin get National Security clearance? The NY Post explains where FBI originally dropped the ball when they first investigated Abedin: Skeptical agents showed Abedin three separate email exchanges she had with an IT staffer regarding the operation of the private Clinton server during Clintons tenure at State. Abedin claimed she did not recall the email exchanges. So if you believe Abedin, she didnt know the private clintonemail.com server that hosted her [email protected] account even existed until she heard about it in the news. Comey was a believer; he didnt even bother to call her back for further questioning. Case closed. But Abedins role in this caper begs for fresh scrutiny. Making false statements to a federal agent is a felony. So is mishandling classified information. By forwarding classified emails to her personal email account and printing them out at home, Abedin appears to have violated a Classified Information NonDisclosure Agreement she signed at the State Department on Jan. 30, 2009, in which she agreed to keep all classified material under the control of the US government. An infographic puts it in a simpler form, stating how government emails were forwarded to her Yahoo account  for what? No one knows. There was allegedly a counter-espionage case going on around the time. With 500,000,000 email accounts hacked earlier last year, Abedin has put our National Security in danger.

What Is Causing The Strange Trumpet Sounds In The Sky All Over The World?   May 21st, 2015 All over the globe, people are recording extremely loud sounds coming from the sky. In many instances, these ominous noises sound like someone is blowing a trumpet. So what are we supposed to make of these apocalyptic sounds? Should we be concerned? Well, what we do know is that this is truly a global phenomenon. In addition to being heard at locations all over the United States and Canada, these sounds have also been recorded in Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Sweden, England, Costa Rica, Ukraine and France. If you go to YouTube and type in strange sounds, you will literally get hundreds of results from all over the planet. Of course there are many scientists that insist that there must be a rational explanation for these strange sounds. Some theories have suggested fracking, rock bursts, venting of high-pressure gas, atmospheric pressure or the natural background noise of our planet as the causes of these sounds, but so far none of those theories have been proven. But two things seem certain  these noises sure are creepy, and they just keep on happening. And this phenomenon is now really starting to get a whole lot of attention. Just within the last month, there have been headlines about it in major new sources all over the planet. For instance, the following is a brief excerpt about this phenomenon from an article in the New York PostVideo clips from around the world have captured an evil-sounding trumpet noise coming from the sky  but no one can explain exactly what it is. A number of people have filmed the bizarre sound over the past 10 years with the latest coming from Germany. Video of this most recent incident that happened in Germany is posted below. What do you think could possibly be making this noise?As I discussed above, similar sounds have been recorded all over the globe in recent years. Very quickly, let me share four examples with you that were recently included in an article by Melissa Dykes . This first one comes from British Columbia, CanadaThis next one was recorded in Allen, TexasSimilar sounds have also been heard all the way on the other side of the planet. This example comes from Queensland, AustraliaLastly, this next remarkable video comes from Melbourne, AustraliaPersonally, I have no idea what is causing these sounds. But so many people around the world are experiencing them that it seems to rule out a hoax. So how can we explain them? The following theories were put forward by the Daily MailTectonic plates grinding  Tectonic plates are pieces of the Earths crust and uppermost mantle, together referred to as the lithosphere. The plates are around 100 km (62 mi) thick and consist of two principal types of material: oceanic crust (also called sima from silicon and magnesium) and continental crust (sial from silicon and aluminium). Atmospheric pressure  Atmospheric pressure is defined as the force per unit area exerted against a surface by the weight of the air above that surface. Trains shunting  Self explanatory  noise comes from trains in reaction to the track and overhead wires. Construction  Building works, especially if going on at the same time across a specific area, can led to similar sounds. Aliens  Can this be an alien lifeform in the sky, perhaps scouring out Earth? HAARP weapon  Rumours persist that the U.S. government uses secret weapons in the sky for defence and weather modifying, the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (HAARP). This wouldnt explain the sounds in other countries however  The Apocalypse and the Seven Trumpets of Heaven  Seven trumpets are sounded, one at a time, to cue apocalyptic events that were seen in the vision of the Revelation of Christ Jesus, by John of Patmos. Somewhat more worrying as it would signal the end of the world  The scientists at NASA have a different explanation. What they think is being heard is simply the natural background noise that our planet is constantly producing  According to NASA, it could be the earths background noise. A statement from the agency said: If humans had radio antennas instead of ears, we would hear a remarkable symphony of strange noises coming from our own planet. Scientists call them tweeks, whistlers and sferics. They sound like background music from a flamboyant science fiction film, but this is not science fiction. Earths natural radio emissions are real and, although were mostly unaware of them, they are around us all the time. To me, that explanation by NASA doesnt really ring true, but I dont have a really good explanation either. Do you believe that you know what is causing these strange sounds? Please feel free to share your thoughts by posting a comment below  Effing creepy at that. Just Truth The article that said that HAARP can be ruled out isnt correct. It says: This wouldnt explain the sounds in other countries however  HAARP was developed to advance nonlethal weapons in other countries, and works by bouncing frequencies off the ionosphere, thus being able to direct them to any part of the globe. naked swimmer Also all the millions of other energies going into the air could be causing noises. Just think of all the antennas going up every year & satellites being launched !! In the book Toxic Electricity 2nd ed. it says that one thing that could be causing colony collapse disorder is wireless energy. Visible light is way less than 1% of the spectrum. Toxic Electricity & Dirty Electricity are interesting books. People dont realize how much impact electricity & wireless is having on the environment. kfilly I believe this is a sign of the end times. There are too many things that seem to be lining up with the book of Revelations (global government, wars/rumors of wars, disease, famine, and the proposed digital currency by Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase). The bible was written way before this, and events are mirroring what has been predicted a very, very long time ago. jaxon64 All of creation cries out in longing   Crawford Tillinghast More like your reality is fracturing and no matter what you believe in, it cannot protect you from what lays Beyond. CarriedbyGrace We who have Christ have perfect peace and no fear. These are extremely exciting times and we look forward to what is turning out to be a spectacular and supernatural time in our lives. Elaine Perkins The number one sign is Israel becoming a nation again in 1948, after years of being dispersed all over the World, the Jews are gradually returning home; And they are speaking their Hebrew language again after 2,000 years. One major sign that this is the last days is that the World is turning against Israel and what for: Because they will not give up that little tiny speck of real estate that you have to get a magnifying glass to see it on the Middle East map, that is IF you can find a Middle East map with Israel listed on it anymore. I have posted the land owners in the Middle East many times for ALL to see; But the Anti-Israel Haters will not admit the TRUTH when it is before them. I am posting it one more time below: Square land 0.6 of 1.0% 8,059 Million Arabias 756,981 29.2 Million Iraqs Irans land 636,374 76 Million There has never been a Palestinian people. This is something that the Romans did when they conquered Jerusalem from the Jews. These so called Palestinians are Arabs; They are not Jews and do not belong in Israel or Jerusalem. They belong with their own people. folgers22 This story is spooky, but when I listen to the sounds on the videos, they dont really sound like trumpets to me. I would love to hear majestic music from the skies, because I know what that would mean, but what I hear sounds more like industrial equipment or slow-moving trains and other man-made noises. I wouldnt want to stampede to an assumption on this one. Did anyone see that movie, Red State, where a group of Christians stops dead in their tracks when they hear a booming trumpet from the skies and assume its the end of the world, not realizing some college kids down the road are fooling around with an iPod full of trumpet mp3s and a firestation siren horn? (Theres a lot more to the plot, but that twist at the end seems oddly apropos here.) My town is a nexus point for several different railroad lines and several switching yards and a commuter rail line. I hear a lot of trains during the day and night. Some of these sounds remind me of the sounds I hear when theyre shunting trains back and forth and moving the big heavy cargo trains through slowly, especially at night when there arent as many competing sounds. I am not an expert on the atmosphere and what it might be able to do with sound, but I do know it can have an effect on sound. For instance, Ive always heard you can hear noises easier across open water than through the woods. It also has an effect on radio waves. Folks who know radio know the layers of the atmosphere can do strange things with radio waves. For instance, when the weather is right, you can pick up an AM radio station transmitting hundreds or thousands of miles away when the signal bounces off the troposphere down to you somewhere over the horizon. Last year, I read an article explaining how changes in temperature at different altitudes can warp visible light. The article explained the Titanic might have sunk within visual range of the Carpathia, but due to the effects of cold and warm layers of air, witnesses saw something totally different from the largest cruiseship in the world sinking 5 miles away. So I wonder if sound can react the same way; originating from one point, bouncing around from one temperature layer to another, then coming down elsewhere distorted and unrecognizable as these sounds? Sandbagger You have the best explanation Ive heard. Trumpets from God its not. Do I believe God when he says he will use trumpets? Yes. But I believe what another poster said there will be NO DOUBT as to them BEING TRUMPETS. The wild-eyed proclamations that these sounds are THOSE final trumpets only serve to make Christians look nutty. Perhaps that is one interpretation of the scripture: Ephesians 4:14 (KJV) That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; folgers22 Thank you! I feel exactly the same way-if it really happens, it will be incontrovertible, unarguable, definite 100% honest-to-goodness trumpets. If this were truly the work of God, why would it be spread out over the course of years in different places and why would it sound so mundane? You would think an omnipotent omniscient being would be able to sound real trumpets simultaneously everywhere worldwide and ensure not one of us would be able to miss it. I wouldnt be surprised if/when the day comes that you even hear the trumpets inside, even over your iPod. I dont think He would let a single one of us escape the message. I think if you go with Occams Razor and look for the most likely explanation, peculiar atmospherics+terrestrial sound makes the most sense. HumbleAmerican Until something actually happens, theyre just noises. Was looking for Jesus in the clouds, but he didnt return, again! In current news, a major oil spill in California, 9 miles of a beach covered. So well see if gas prices go up. Its about time for a gas spike. Mike Well, if you read the book of Revelation, youll see that Jesus comes back at the end in an event called the Day of Lord or the Second Coming. Before Jesus returns you will see the rise of the Antichrist and a one world government. And when all nations go to attack Jerusalem under the antichrists rule, Jesus will return. No pretribulation rapture is coming. Were all going to go through it (Christian and Non-Christian) if indeed we are in the last of the last days. HumbleAmerican As I stated below, I apologize for bringing Jesus in to the conversation. It has nothing to do with the article, and was wrong of me. I would agree. We are all in this sh** storm together. Hold on tight, endure to the end and PRAY! uisconfruzed So Mike, it appears youre a post tribber. Are you reformed as well? I thought I was the only one by reading these comments. CarriedbyGrace This topic is so touchy but my husband and I were just discussing this earlier this evening so here goes. My husband contends that if one of the major goals of the anti-christ is to kill Jews and Christians, how is it possible for the catching up to happen before the anti-christ comes on the scene, who would he kill if we were all gone? Why are there so many warnings and signs described in the Bible if there were no Christians left here to heed them? Is our catching up in the clouds going to happen simultaneously to Christs coming to defeat anti-christ or prior to that time. Sheesh, I have been studying the bible for almost 40 years and I still cant definitively say anything other than Pre-Wrath rapture. algol2000 There isnt going to be any rapture. He who endures to the end shall be saved. Joe Woolf I agree .. Were all going at the 7th trump together. ( thats the last trump ) Its a touchy topic around many Christians but, I dont believe there will be any rapture happening before the last trump. David You know, for having the Screen name HumbleAmerican you could sure use some humbling. What I mean by that is, if all youre worried about is gas prices than you need a major wake-up call, brother! Just look around whats going on in the world today, and youll see that there are Volcanoes erupting, along with Earthquakes and diseases, wars AND rumors of more wars to come. I also heard the sound, what I believe is a Trumpet blasting off. It was the 19th of April, and I was discussing with my daughter about how so many people arent considering the facts that are being presented right in front of them; ignoring what may be to ensure their own happiness, and self-security. We may soon be at Civil or Foreign or BOTH in this country! Soon after I had gotten done telling it to her, the trumpet sound was coming from outside. She walked to the door and opened it up more, and said silently, It sounds like theres a war going on right now. Thats when I got up and walked to the door to hear it sounding off. Its just a shame in the sense that it was raining outside! Id be able to hear it better, but then again, if you believe that its a trumpet declaring the End of Days is nigh, than you know that youll get another chance to hear it again. But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. The virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut. Later the others also came. Lord, Lord, they said, open the door for us! But he replied, Truly I tell you, I dont know you. Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour. Matthew 25:10-13; NIV. HumbleAmerican Im very humble, I boast about nothing, because I have nothing. Gas prices affect everyone, in one way or another. As for whats going on in the world, natural disasters have been happening for thousands of years. Wars and rumors of wars have happened for thousands of years. Diseases have been around since man arrived on earth. I do apologize for bringing Jesus in to the conversation. It has nothing to do with the article, and was wrong of me. Its up to nine miles now? They said it was only four. And its not making much mainstream news. But have u seen the pictures? Heart breaking. uisconfruzed
| November 14, 2015 at 10:33 am | Reply STEREOTYPES EXIST FOR A REASON AND EVERYONE DOES IT, SO DONT ACT LIKE YOURE EXEMPT FROM A HEALTHY WAY OF EXAMINING AND PROTECTING YOUR ENVIRONMENT. I noticed this subject coming up more than once in the news feed on FB today, that I thought Id address it, instead of acting like its the Big Elephant In The Room The Elephant is that ONLY WHITES are to blame for stereotyping and racism, and that BLACKS are the only ones who receive racism, that is so far from the truth, as can be found in any google search on how whites are treated by blacks. Studies have found they are MORE racist than whites and I know why, mainly due to the Chip That Is ON Their Shoulder discussed later. Racism and stereotyping exist not only because of the obvious, like ones experiences and their encounters with certain individual types, but also what one has been taught, (right or wrong) or better yet, both experience and what they have taught matches, so how can one NOT come to a solid conclusion? At this point their views are pretty much sealed. Kind of like getting SAVED it isnt enough to know in your head something is true about JESUS and His word, but once the heart agrees, then its pretty much sealed. Why are BLACKS (sorry not into being politically correct, no one is calling me an EUROPEAN AMERICAN and REAL Africans hate the comparison lol, google it) the ONLY ones who CRY RACISM at every turn, at every perceived injustice, at every corrective criticism, at every comment made, at not taking accountability for their actions, etc? .The main reason is . THE VICTIM MENTALITY: Want to read a great book on the subject, Ken Hamblins Pick A Better Country and Plain Talk And Common Sense I have them both and I use to listen to him when he was on the air and he is right ,and he is as black as they get, (color wise) and he is from Harlem. So I trust his and Bill Cosbys (although, he has tarnished his name now) take on the VICTIM MENTALITY. All one has to do is look around them and see it is true. As you can see, my focus will be on RACISM against People Of Color not against whites, because that is the consensus going around and what I have experienced and others I know have experienced. And before anyone tries to call me a RACIST, I am not! I judge people individually, till you prove the stereotype right, then that only makes me MORE cautious of the next person who comes along. And so far in my 51 yrs of EXPERIENCE, I have learned that STEREOTYPES EXIST FOR A REASON. But, like everyone else who has their flaws, such as any white insecure jealous woman, or any man trying to get into my pants, or anyone who exhibits Unsafe or Unhealthy attributes, I will still give another person, no matter what their race is, the benefit of the doubt, although I will say, some more than others. Im not stupid, or ignorant, its called being WISE. It is one thing to respect others and be cordial, it is another to just let anyone into your life, or do business with them. Trust is earned not freely given. . Going back to the VICTIM MENTALITY, this is what is HOLDING THE BLACK COMMUNITY DOWN and is why stereotypes and racism exist. Saying it doesnt, or trying to TWIST or SPIN into existence something that just isnt true, will not FLY with most who have even half a brain. Common Sense and ones Experience will always trump POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. The media doesnt want you to know the truth as they OMIT or SPIN things, but they can only do so much, because of all the REALITY SHOWS. (uncensored behavior and mentality) and NEWS PIECES that portray a better reality. Sad thing is too many just wont say anything, they just talk in private about the subject among those liked minded out of FEAR! But truth is truth, so here goes. Does anyone else find it interesting that throughout history, many different races, if not all have been slaves, ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History of slavery ) yet ONLY BLACKS are left with a VICTIM MENTALITY? dont get me wrong, what was done to them and any slave at the time or in the past and even now (Are we focused on the 200,000 sex trafficked in Sacramento alone??? of course not!!!) was wrong. I would have to say that the MISTREATMENT and abuse of another is wrong, but slavery was a way of life even going back to the biblical times. When you think about it, we are ALL SLAVES to something. Slavery and bondage are a way of life even when it comes to ourselves. Some are in BONDAGE to their desires and indulgent behaviors, to their insecurities, to their relationships, to their job, to their boss, to their parents, to their children etc. The only FREE SLAVE is one who is a bond servant to Christ and who has follow His Lordship in their life. OK, no rabbit trails, Ill leave it at that. Point is SLAVERY is not as dirty of a word as many would like to think .Like many things in our lives, it isnt what happens to us that matters, but what we DO with it .sad to say, most, but not all blacks throughout history have chosen to take the NEGATIVE REACTION for their lot in life The Blame Game is so unbecoming  and senseless. I dont care who you are, if one cannot take ACCOUNTABILITY individually for their own actions, in spite of their surroundings and circumstances, then one will naturally FALL PREY to the negativity that comes with that choice. One of my 5 Factors, is 1) ONES OWN SIN. (starts here) John Mcwhorter and Ken Hamblin adequately and articulately explains all the ends and outs of a VICTIM MENTALITY among the black community, way better than I can. All I know is, no other race that has been slaves throughout history has played the RACE CARD nor have they proclaimed themselves as VICTIMS none. If anything they OVERCAME and CONTRIBUTED! They banded together (did not destroy each other, black on black crime is extremely high, 90%) and supported each other, financially and in many other ways, to say WE ARE A PROUD PEOPLE, WE CAN DO THIS More food for thought. I have often wondered, have any of those who feel such an outrage against how the blacks were treated while enslaved (all nationalities throughout history endured the same, blacks are no different) ever thought about what I am about to say? Like I said, we all have choices to go POSITIVE or NEGATIVE in any given situation and to me I would think the black community would be able to move on .be THANKFUL for being brought to AMERICA for their future generations after slavery. Look what they were SAVED FROM. (For one America gave them CHRISTIANITY/SALVATION!) Who possesses more slaves today than any other group AFRICA! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery in Africa so why is it OK, that blacks can enslave blacks, but no other group can? Why is it that blacks can call themselves degrading names, yet no one else can? Why can they kill whites and not be called racist, but if a black is killed by a white automatically they are racist? Why the double standards? Do they really want to go back to . GENOCIDE, SLAVERY, RAPE an epidemic of AIDS etc. And black women, do you really want to be dominated by a man and treated as property and have your cliterious cut off as a child (without any anesthetic) and live the life of an average African woman .. very hard work, no pleasure, no value, life of servant hood (slavery) always in fear? Seriously, what are theseVictim Mentality Type people fighting for? Do they want to go back to Africa? Of course not, they claim they want to be treated EQUALLY Well, that sounds fair to me, THEN ACT LIKE IT! STOP fitting the stereotype, be the one who says, I dont care what others think of me, if being an Uncle Tom or a Sell Out is what it takes to be Equal then so be it. I will not play victim, I will Take The Bull By The Horn be accountable for my behavior and do what it takes legally, ethically, morally and responsibly to FIT IN! and if more and more people did that then stereotypes would change. I could write more on the subject, but feel this is a good place to stop.
Women are not just sexual objects you pigs. Just remember that when they trot out the bejewelled boobs , wear the  TaTa Top , or just want to  Free the Nipple  in the name of empowerment. Ms. Holliday has a message for the pig From Daily Mail : Tess Holliday is using her platform as a model to speak out against Donald Trump and the allegations of sexual assault against him. The 31-year-old took to Instagram over the weekend to share an ad of herself posing in New York Citys Times Square while modeling a New Look Fashion T-shirt that reads: Respect Women #Dump Trump. Respect Women, she captioned the image. Our bodies are not for you to stare at or touch without our consent. Women are not just sexual objects , women are not here for your consumption. So many of us have a sexual assault story, myself included, she continued. To endorse someone who not just condones this behavior but actively engages in it would be an awful step backwards for women not just in the US but across the world. #dumptrump #dumptrump #dumptrump The feminist in action Also might I add Im NOT telling you who to vote for. Trump is a pig & thats a fact. [sic] The photo, which was taken by her longtime partner Nick Holliday, sees Tess posed with her hands on her hips as she stares at the camera. Along with the white T-shirt, which features black block lettering, she is wearing ripped jeans and black high-heeled sandals. The photo has been liked more than 62,000 times since it was posted on Saturday, and unsurprisingly, the political statement caused a stir. Love the shirt, Tess, one woman wrote. Way to use your constitutionally protected voice. #activism #freedom #feminism. And while many supported Tess statement, there were plenty of people who disagreed with her. Such a shame to have to [unfollow] you, another woman wrote. Use your celebrity for something better than being political. There was also a fierce debate about whether or not Tess post could be seen as an endorsement for the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, and some people who disagreed with her statement attacked the size 22 model for her weight . There is some super hateful stuff on here, one woman wrote. I dont agree or disagree with your position, but I still admire your message. Why cant everyone get along! Dang! Everyone gets to have their own opinion people! And targeting her weight because you disagree? Really? People are crazy, keep up your positive messages Tess! Whatever your political views are, I still love what you represent girl! Read about the rest of this womyns rant here . DCG
Donate  If left activists are concerned about future political victories, they should take seriously the proposition of open dialogue with Trump supporters. For, as far as the political establishment is concerned, we, both left and right, are all deplorables. By Matthew Ricci / counterpunch.org Outside of right-wing circles, explanation of Trumps disheartening victory in the sordid 2016 election has taken two forms. The first, offered by liberal elites in politics, the mainstream media and academia, is that the bewildered herd of benighted voters has delivered a victory to the forces of evil. From incurable racists, xenophobes and misogynists to Sanders loyalists, third-party voters and Russian spies, there is no shortage of scapegoats that the Democratic establishment and their apologists will find to divert attention from their overconfident, self-sabotaged campaign. This view has been rightly criticized by those espousing the second explanation, namely, that, independent of the possible bigotry of Trumps supporters, they do constitute a genuinely downtrodden population, abused by decades of neoliberal policy. Naturally, this is the minority opinion in a political discourse dominated by what was, during the homestretch of the election, the hugely pro-Clinton media. Yet, in this minority voice lies not only the truth about Trumps rise, but also the seeds of future action. If left activists are concerned about future political victories, they should take seriously the proposition of open dialogue with Trump supporters. For, as far as the political establishment is concerned, we, both left and right, are all deplorables. The possibility of cooperation has already been articulated by Bernie Sanders who stated the day after the election that [he] and other progressives are prepared to work with [Trump], unless the President-elect resorted to racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies (1). Sanders did not denigrate Trump voters as witless cave-dwellers or plead with them to change their regressive views. Inherent in Sanders statement is the idea, recognized by some commentators (2) for years, that the poor, white, Republican-voting working class shares material concerns with the progressive left. Further calls for solidarity have come from Michael Albert, who claimed we should approach Trumps advocates not as enemies, but as potential allies (3). These voices call for cooperation with the white working class after an election featuring a Democratic party that held them entirely in contempt. Hillary Clinton, scandal-ridden, hopelessly unpopular and emblematic of liberal technocracy, is now famous for her basket of deplorables remark. The leaked Podesta emails, which reveal her admission to Wall Street audiences that she maintains public and private political personas, further demonstrate her disdain for working people (4). This should come as no surprise after her ardent initial defense of the disastrous TPP, which, as rumblings in her entourage suggested (5), she may have ultimately supported. Of course, anti-democratic sentiment on the part of liberal elites is an invariant feature of political history, so Clintons remarks should come as no surprise. The disdain-behind-closed-doors of the Clinton campaign has been fully unveiled after the election, with oversimplified depictions of Trump voters as mere racists/misogynists/xenophobes and unending denial in the media of their economic plight. This plight of the white, working class was in plain sight, having been carefully analyzed by thoughtful, mainstream economists for months prior to the election. For example, on issue of the global rise of populist parties, Brown University political economist Mark Blyth noted in a September lecture the correlation between lack of education, chronically low wages and exposure to Chinese import competition with support for right-wing authoritarian leaders (6). A few weeks later, Blyth was left completely unsurprised by Clintons defeat. What else but an abandonment of the finance-friendly Democrats could one expect in a world in which $28.5 billion dollars in bonuses were awarded to as yet unprosecuted Wall Street bankers in 2015 (compared to the $15 billion paid to all American workers making minimum wage in the same year) (7), and in which $12 trillion were recently estimated to be stored away in offshore tax havens (8)? What else can one expect from a group now suffering from an increasing death rate (9) in a country where real wages have stagnated since the 1960s (10)? This is not to say there are no serious racist and nativist elements to the Trump constituency, including the thug-in-chief himself. These dark elements have been extensively explored and rightly denounced. Yet, this is immaterial to the tactical issue of creating a unified peoples movement in the country. Either the left abandons the sometimes-racist, white poor or it makes a genuine attempt to understand, empathize, and cooperate with them. Serious efforts in this regard have already been mounted, including by Berkley sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild, who lived deep in Tea Party country, the Louisiana bayou, for five years, as recounted in her book, Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right . Here, she met an embattled people, facing poverty and environmental disaster, who were deeply religious, fiercely anti-government and professedly non-racist. Hochschild and the Louisianans differed in their understanding of racism, though her goal was not to proselytize. Instead, she wanted to scale an empathy wall and to feel what it was like to have political beliefs the opposite of her own. We, she writes, on both sides, wrongly imagine that empathy with the other side brings an end to clearheaded analysis when, in truth, its on the other side of that bridge that the most important analysis can begin (11). The notion that real politics only begins when we sincerely address those who disagree with us is not a new one. Gandhi, both a political leader and the head of a strict religious group, recognized that politics was about reaching a broad public and not about cultish self-congratulation (12). Naturally, this entails approaching those who disagree with us, with empathy and understanding as our primary strategy. Goodwill and openness should not be reserved only for those whose views we find palatable. Indeed, goodwill and openness mean nothing unless they are applied precisely to those who disagree with us, perhaps staunchly. In fact, the job has been made all the easier since Trumps supporters often materially agree with the progressive left, and, importantly, dislike Trump. For example, 21% of those who claimed Trump was not honest and trustworthy actually voted for him; moreover, Democratic and Republican voters had reservations about their candidate in equal numbers (13). Hoschschild also noted this lack of enthusiasm among Louisianan Trump supporters, who recognized the plutocrats clownishness, but, nevertheless, felt completely abandoned by the Democratic Party (14). In the aftermath of an election featuring earths two least popular humans, we can be sure that only a small minority will be inexorably attached to their candidates. This could leave open the door to genuine dialogue between progressives and the typically-Republican right, though such discussion is no certainty. For example, there have been a number of meetings at Ivy League universities about solidarity with endangered minorities and the plan-of-attack against Trump (15), but no meetings, to my knowledge, explicitly designed to reach out to Trump voters. It goes without saying that the former types of meetings are absolutely necessary, but there is no reason why they cannot co-exist with the latter type. Where is, for example, the effort at elite universities to organize discussions with Republican voters who often live in rural areas not an hours drive from campus? Where are the burgeoning coalitions between equally-dissatisfied left and right voters bent on holding Trumps feet to the fire on the promises, which, with high probability, he will break? Major marches are planned for the period around Trumps inauguration, though not a great deal of thought has been given to the antagonizing effect of such events in the absence of sincere, widespread desire for cross-party collaboration. Simple repulsion at Trump supporters amounts to the discarding of 60 million votes in a world where, alarmingly, elections still matter. There can be no strategic reason for such repulsion, especially since Middle America, despite its votes for Trump, was (16) and is (17) a hotbed of left politics. Nor does lack of repulsion equate to capitulation to Trumps assuredly monstrous regime, which marches the planet ever closer to self-destruction. Instead, genuine openness and principled collaboration with Trumps supporters may be the only thing to turn the one major bright spot of the election, the Sanders campaign, into an ongoing, overwhelming political force. The only confirmed adversary of left activists should be the political establishment, the smug network of technocratic state planners, financiers and war profiteers, which forsook Trump voters, along with much of the global population, in the first place.

Email The liberal internet sites and some in social media actually believe that the acquittal on all charges brought against the Bundys and five others last week for their peaceful protest and occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon was a sign of white privilege . One outlet, even allowed a black columnist to write that white privilege was now "weaponized." Consider the moronic claim of Chauncey Devega at Salon , "Just consider: An all-white jury acquitted militant religious fundamentalists whose avowed aim is hurting the U.S." Excuse me? Hurting the US? How so Mr. Devega? Well, according to Mr. Devega, "Despite the overwhelming evidence against the Bundy militants, on Thursday a federal jury in Portland acquitted them of federal weapons and conspiracy charges. This shocked many observers. It should not have." "Black Americans and other people of color often talk about how there is one legal system for 'them' and another for 'us,'" he added. What is this evidence of which he speaks? Well, he doesn't quite tell us. He never mentions any laws that were broken. It's not against the law to keep and bear arms . It's not against the law to go and occupy an area that is supposed to be under the people's control per the Constitution. Technically, per the Constitution, the land does not belong to the central government. It's not against the law to hold a press conference there. It's not against the law to address your government for grievances. In fact, all those things are a part of the law! Oh, and what does Mr. Devega have to say about this photo with a black man standing with LaVoy Finicum and Pete Santilli ? Does that look like white privilege to you? Did LaVoy Finicum receive white privilege Chauncey? I don't think so. The tyranny you are supporting murdered him in cold blood and now a jury has determined that they were doing nothing wrong that should have warranted their arrest nor his murder. How about the months these men sat in jail in Oregon while being denied bail? Was that white privilege? What about the fact they are facing similar trumped up charges in Nevada from something that took place two years ago, and are still sitting in jail? Is that white privilege Chauncey? He then went on to ask if Muslims did this would it be terrorism. I can answer that, yes. However, the reason why I can affirm that is because they would have created violence, just as they are taught to do in the Koran as they follow in the footsteps of their founder, Muhammad. They usually do. The only violence at Bundy Ranch or in Oregon was the result of the Oregon State Police , the FBI , and the Bureau of Land Management . Those were the people with guns pointed at citizens, despite Devega's claims otherwise. If that was not enough, Devega forgot that a Native American woman, Sheila M. Warren, testified on behalf of  the defense! Was that your white privilege Mr. Devega? "As the social-media hashtag #CrimingWhileWhite signals, there is a dual system of justice in the United States of America One exists for white people  especially white conservatives and other members of the right wing  and a separate one for people of color and Muslims," added Devega. "This is white privilege weaponized through the law." Devega is not the only one to put forth this nonsense. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof also claimed this acquittal may have been racially motivated. Other people on social media chimed in making the same ridiculous claims without ever once citing any law that was broken. Terrorism is legal when ur white https://t.co/ewFsaRpJVJ
We've recently had two object lessons in the worthlessness of the "Trump is Doomed" polling saga. A few days ago, the media was loudly trumpeting that Hillary's victory was inevitable, that the polls were in and she was going to ignore Trump and focus on building her administration and winning downticket races. And then, just like last time around, the numbers turned around again. I was recently asked to predict the race. I answered that the one thing I could predict is that the media will claim a landslide for Hillary right before the election. That much is very likely. It's in the media's interest to spread FUD by promoting polls that predict not just a Hillary win, but a landslide, creating the perception that voting is useless. The more Republicans feel that the outcome is futile, the less likely they will be to go out and vote. But the scandal polling numbers have a history of rebounding. This remains a challenging and very unusual election. The premature panic we've seen in some circles is unhealthy. We shouldn't completely ignore poll numbers, but neither should we treat them as inevitable. We've had two major lessons in why that's short sighted.
Search form Search From Bad to Worse : Obamas Ransom Payment to Iran is Just the Tip of the Iceberg In his bid to pursue a legacy, Obama charts disastrous course with reckless abandon. November 2, 2016  Most of us, including several democratic lawmakers, cringed when Obama inked the Iran deal but those of us who are familiar with the malevolent nature of the Iranian regime, recoiled in horror when we learned that Obama transferred $400 million to the Iranians in exchange for four American citizens held captive by the mullahs on trumped up charges. The $400 million was part of a larger installment totaling $1.7 billion, ostensibly to settle claims Iran had against the United States stemming from aborted Iranian arms purchases dating back to the Shah. Obama claimed that this was money that was owed to Iran and the settlement, which included $1.3 billion in interest, saved the U.S. taxpayer billions because the Iranians were demanding even more at the Hague tribunal, where the claim was being adjudicated. The timing and method of the cash transfers were disquieting to say the least and raised serious questions of legality as well as broader geo-political concerns. The Americans were freed only after Iran received its $400 million. The payment, which was airlifted in the dead of night in an unmarked cargo plane, was made in untraceable cash, stacked on wooden pallets. The Iranians demanded Swiss Francs and Euros rather than Dollars and a pliant Obama agreed to the Islamic Republics dictates. Gleeful Iranian leaders were quick to announce victory and claimed that the payment was indeed a ransom, contradicting the administrations adamant denials. Even within the administration there was confusion about whether the payment was in fact a ransom. State Department spokesman Mark Toner came very close to acknowledging this fact when he noted that the $400 million was used as leverage to ensure the Americans safe return. The White House however, quickly repudiated the State Departments characterization. Even if one were to believe the story peddled by the administration, the mere appearance of a quid pro quo payment potentially exposes the U.S. to extortion and hostage-taking. The Iranians certainly believed it was a ransom payment and more likely than not, every two-bit dictator on the planet saw it that way as well. But there are deeper more troubling aspects to this convoluted story. In his January 17, 2016 address to the American people, Obama tried to put a positive spin on his dealings with the Islamic Republic but as noted by Rick Richman in an excellent article featured in Mosaic , the deal struck with the Iranians was rotten to its core and the administration deliberately kept the American people in the dark about various aspects of the shady arrangement. The $400 million that the U.S. transferred to Iran came from Irans Foreign Military Sales (FMS) account with the Pentagon. The balance of 1.3 billion ostensibly represented interest accrued since 1979. But Obama neglected to note that when Iran filed its lawsuit, the U.S. filed counterclaim against Iran for $817 million for Iranian breaches of its obligations under the FMS program. The U.S. could have conceivably won that counterclaim which would have meant wooden pallets of cash for the American treasury, courtesy of the Islamic Republic. Moreover, American plaintiffs maintained sixteen U.S. court judgments against the Islamic Republic stemming from that regimes involvement in terrorist activities. Those judgments totaled $3.9 billion in compensatory and punitive damages. Some plaintiffs sought to recover their Judgments directly from Irans FMS account but their efforts were stymied by the Clinton administration. Instead, under a convoluted deal struck between Congress and the Clinton administration in 2,000, the U.S. treasury was to pay the holders of the judgments against Iran for the amount of their compensatory damages and 10 percent of their punitive damages up to the amount in the FMS fund. The judgments would then be subrogated to the United States, which meant that judgments became direct U.S claims against the Iranian government. Iran ignored the Judgments and never paid any of the plaintiffs. Under U.S. law, the $400 million sitting in the FMS account should have gone back to the U.S. treasury, which had already paid the judgment holders. But the U.S. treasury never collected a dime on the subrogated claims since Obama shipped the money off on wooden pallets to Iran. Essentially, the U.S. taxpayer ended up footing the bill for Irans terrorism while the Iranians were never held accountable for their maleficence. Obamas actions represented blatant disregard for the law, for the victims of terrorism and for the American taxpayer. His claim of saving the taxpayer billions represents the zenith of mendacity. Obama claimed that the payments had to be made in cash because existing sanctions prohibited normal banking procedures. But as noted by Richman, the sanctions regimen expressly permits payments made to settle Iranian claims instituted at The Hague, exposing yet another lie by the Obama administration. There was one, and only one reason why the Iranians requested cash and all but the most disingenuous know what that reason is. The Iranians are the worlds foremost state-sponsors of international terrorism. They finance terrorist groups and proxy militias throughout the region and internationally but can only do so through illicit means that circumvent normal methods of financing. Hence, they demanded untraceable cash. The misery that we are currently witnessing in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere is due in no small part to the Obama administration which provided the Iranians with the cash necessary to keep operations flowing. In addition to the $1.7 billion in cash, Obama also authorized the release of seven convicted Iranian felons and expunged warrants on 14 others. But this aspect of the transaction seems almost trivial when considering the sheer mendacity and illegality of nearly every other aspect of the deal. Lastly, the transfer of such a large sum to Iran in settlement of an alleged legal claim required the attorney generals approval but the administration has yet to produce any document bearing Loretta Lynchs signature authorizing such payment. On October 7, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) presented Lynch with a series of questions seeking clarification of various aspects of the deal. Lynch, whose tenure as attorney general is proving to be as corrupt and partisan as her predecessor, has inexplicably refused to answer the lawmakers queries. In a desperate attempt to establish a legacy, Obama pursued the Iran deal with reckless abandon, forfeiting positions previously regarded as red lines and signing the worst deal in U.S. diplomatic history. The ancillary deal struck with the Iranians concerning American hostages was laced with outright lies and enabled the Iranians to continue their reign or regional terror. More importantly, it may also have been in violation of existing U.S. law and Lynchs stonewalling only lends credence to that notion.
Report Copyright Violation  I notice here at GLP the amount of doom sayers seems to go down when a republican is in office (Bush). But when the left get in office the doomsaying increases.

Good luck with that. owr It wont just be the police targeting rioting blacks.The average white is ready fearfully cautious of black thugs. The thugs know this and they try to intimidate whites by flaunting theirs MTV image of the Gangsta by learning the right facial expressions, and wearing their pants on their ass. Stacking gang signs, even if not in a gang to appear knowledgeable about such things. It might work with some of the girls, but to the average young white male it is perceived as a potential threat. The primary difference between white males and black males is that only 30%, on average, black males are not convicted felons, and cannot legally possess a firearm. On the other hand nearly 80% of white males have no felony conviction, and can, or do possess legal firearms. Blacks are 13% of our population. Whites are a little under 70%. There are also a huge number of pissed off white veterans of Vietnam, Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan, who would not mind a little domestic house cleaning. You can bet your ass, and not be afraid of losing it, that these Vets are Trump supporters. Be careful what you wish for. The real world is not MTV, or a gangsta movie. Cornczech This morning on my walk to the Howard Redline stop in the Rogers Park neighborhood in Chicago, IL ..I was called out to by a black woman: Hey, F* YOU, White B#tch! The sad part, because I had to stop acting and looking scared a few years back when I first MOVED to this hood, (sometime after Obama became King), is that I am USED to this kind of thing, so I started to giggle after that outburst yes, the abuse got worse  but I get this at least once a week when I walk to the store, to the EL .to the bank  so (shrug). I have never called a black man or woman a nigger (I bet I get blasted or removed or censored for that but I get called whitey, hillbilly (Im a Cracker, lets get THAT straight!), and a myriad of other race specific names ..I have even been assaulted for being white and standing up for myself (I am a female, by the way .so, I have OTHER stories about my lovely experience living in CHICAGO the next Detroit .) So how am I a racist? I grew up in Texas and never had problems or saw violence..or had violence perpetrated against me ..since I came here  So tell me again how I am a racist? My LAST question is: WHEN DID AMERICA come to such a SAD STATE? owr My suggestion is to get out of Chicago, it will be a pure hell-hole in the coming depression. Go back to Texas, the economy is much better there, and race relations are as well. Ted Dura oh joy Trump to dump 40 million mexicans and open season on rioting niggasSee its True !

Jo Peter That is certainly a valid way to look at it. Some people view the order of the universe as through an impersonal nature force, and others consider it a conscious design by an intelligent creator.

Bernie ran to Vermont in 1968, to get away from BLACKS to raise HIS family in SAFETY Sanders switched PARTIES, BETRAYED the Veterans, and instigates the Blacks and then RUNS AWAY. In January 1962, Sanders led a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadles segregated campus housing policy. We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments, Sanders said at the protest. But then Sanders ran to SAFE LILLY WHITE VERMONT to raise HIS children far away from those Blacks he wants you to live with. doodaa Cindyejohnson1 my .friends mate Is getting 98$.

Jones This is the classic  lets get dumb ass to do the dirty work for us trick. This dude is being played by the same people who will drop his ass on the street when theyre done with him. Inciting race wars and turning people against each other. This dude is a total looser. The only rapping he should do is with some tape around his flappy mouth. Someone give this dude a hug and ask him if hes making the world a better place by being a dick. Jolly Roger This moron is just a tool, paid by rich people to incite racial tensions, with the usual hollow threats designed to intimidate white people as part of their ongoing divide-and-conquer agenda. We dont want to work. We dont want to go to school. We demand to be handed everything we want, and if we dont get it, well attack white people. Shut up, you idiot, and go back to your zoo. No intelligent debate. No civilized discussion. Just a gang of RACIST thugs trying to intimidate people based on their skin color. Tell me more about equality. I hate to participate, or even respond to a racist tirade, but these Soros-funded useful idiots may make it necessary. Just be ready to mow em down along with the wetbacks, just in case they make that necessary. doodaa Nigga just might get his ass shot. L Garou Is that an admission of retardation, or shall we produce his test scores to prove it? doodaa I thought all lives mattered until this dumb nigger started talking. Now I wonder. owr They are being programmed by George Soros to be agent provocateurs to create racial tension to allow for martial law to occur in order to keep the establishment as is. Clinton will insure this if elected. 8s5s5 To help payoff my student-loans I worked as a NYC teacher in troubled neighborhoods for ten years. During those ten years I saw delinquents call each other niggas hundreds of times every single school day. If I had done it once, I would have been fired that same day. They punched each other, stole from each other, and from the faculty, vandalized the school, threw brand new text books out the window but the state and federal funds continued to pour in, very much contrary to popular belief. They actually got more money then the nicer areas. When I was finally able to move to a good school district, I couldnt believe it. When I told the children (99% Caucasians) to take a a book and read quietly they actually did it. No exaggeration, you good actually hear your own respiration, thats how quiet it was!!! And yes, you can find some schools with 95-99% white student population. I was never a racist but this was too much. The difference is incredible!!! Unfortunately if you notice a obvious behavioral difference between races, you are labeled as some kind of a bad person and the general public has learned to accept this word racist as derogatory regardless of the evidences that may exist, and we all know that they do exist. This denial has successfully forced illogical integration, the destruction of our liberty and country and the rise of economic fascist billionaires. Donald Trump, the only billionaire to go against is fellow elites is being completely typecast as the rich white guy that must be a racist. He is probably the one and only chance the middle class and the poor class will ever see again for justice in this country. The last man to have had his courage was President JFK. owr To actually be a nigger, one must learn to be one. They have plenty of role models to copy. Its a matter of choice. nobody Lol  what a dumb ass! Itll be a hoot watching video of these tough guys(gals?) getting their butts whomped after they destroy mostly their own slums, and if were lucky a few other choice places. desertspeaks we will incite riots everywhere if trump wins translation, we know if trump wins, well have to get jobs to pay rent, food etc. and being societal parasites, we dont want actual jobs, just free shit! owr Culture is learned in the home, and in school. Granny was on total entitlements, so was momma, so is sista, so is my daddy where-ever and who-ever he is. So why I has ta lern all this white shit in school, I quit when Im 16 and be worken the streets, the man..he be givn me food-stamps evey month that I can sell fo beer and cigarettes. Man, we got it fucken made. Zone43 They will stay in the cities, cry babys. Strayhorse What government really fears is when other than people of color, were to take to the streets. Thats why the government and the controlled media hide the truth about crime, racist crime perpetrated against other than people of color. When other than people of color awakens to the truth about crimes against them, L.A., Ferguson, and riots of their kind would pale against the response levied against the government for allowing the crimes against other than people of color to continue as it does today. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 DOES NOT offer any protection for other than people of color. Thats NOT was it was passed for! Other than people of color have NO federal or state protections against prejudice, injustice and inequality. nightwisp The 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 made their rights equal to the white man. If the white man is gone, they are equal to nothing. They will have no rights. owr We are all slaves to the corporations, debt slaves. owr That is precisely why the libs began the fake and un-natural PC agenda, to erode the 1st amendment. Raymond McGraw You are surely as you called it NIGGAS.Does not make a hill of difference who.what where or why.You were just born to riot.You have failed to look at the true one who has enlslaved you the last 8 years in the liberals and there government.Now you have become pawns working for them.Of course you have not realized that either.When the true one wins this and he will. You can then say Gee! Mr .Trump wished I had listened to you. D Urge Hes right WE have been too nice. TRUMP 2016 Lancifer Wildwood Im not sure this person of colour knows what he/they (whatever the frick) are up against if it comes down to it? The inner city shit holes they are seemingly incapable of building up into prospering neighbourhoods are NOT the rest of the US from my travels there. nightwisp * YAWN * please pass the popcorn  Josephine Dorion NO, THE WHITES AINT SCAYRED OF YAH. BE PREPARED TO BE EXTERMINATED. Ed Troyer I see bulldozers, flame throwers . jake wow, doesnt this show how clueless, americans trully are. almost makes one want to tell the trump campaign how to beat the voting fix. where are these guys and gals going to wreak havoc? in the cities where unarmed gay and mainly democrats live, black people, spanish, and poor people in general. poop where you eat, that is a controlled serf. show how your an oreo banker slave. when you get to the rural areas, the black, white, and spanish, rural people will be waiting. you wont stand a chance, against the unified rural people. after following the banking oversears orders, to destroy yourself and your families based on unknown fears, do you think youll be going to valhalla, for following the bloodcults, marching orders, to divide and conquer. killing people who dont have any more say than yourself, because a banker said it was so, priceless. Michael That would be instant death for the 3/5ths, 14th amendment black United States citizens. This country was created by old white men to protect the white race. This is why the Jewish run media are promoting the blacks to riot. In fact black folks if your going to go after a group you might want to think about going after the Jews in the media. As theyre the ones that have set you up to fail. Heres a sweet piece of history the majority of the Negroes dont know. Israel Cohen, the General Secretary of the World Zionist Organization, in his 1912 book A racial program for the 20th Century. And, read into the Congressional Record by Congressman Thomas Abernathy, U.S. House of Representatives Mississippi, 4th District on June 7, 1957, Volume 103, top of page 8559: Israel Cohen penned We must realize that our partys most powerful weapon is racial tension. By propounding into the consciousness of the dark races that for centuries they have been oppressed by the whites, we can mould them to the program of Negro minority against the whites, we will endeavor to instill in the whites a guilt complex for their exploitation of the Negroes. We will aid the Negroes to rise in prominence in every walk of life, in the professions and in the world of sports and entertainment. With this prestige, the Negro will be able to intermarry with the whites and begin a process which will deliver America to our cause. So black folks before you embark on a suicide mission learn some real history and the true cause of your plight. As your anger is miss directed and you will be engaged as belligerents and enemy combatants. Live in peace, be well, and do your homework before you attempt something rash and dangerous. Rick Its coon hunting season once again! Allan Munroe I dont know what color you are but I do know you are a Fucking Nigger ,,,soon you will know what it feels to be without hope just as I felt since you Voted into office That Fucking Ass Kissing Brother of the Muslim Brotherhood , who did all he could do except suck the Dick of the King of Saudi Arabia on National T.V. , all while trying to completely destroy USA but he didnt learn enough in school regarding the Constitution of the USA. Soon Mr. Trump will be writing down names & kicking ASS -Niger Clean Kut Not only do Trumpets have the tactical military training, and are stockpiling ammo, bombs, grenades and other weapons  Theyve been WAITING FOR THE DAY they can legally open fire on blacks and liberals for DECADES. They are SO ready  Trump says he will pay their legal fees and they feel emboldened.? det0918 What a loser  .he is what you get when raise your children with violence, hit, beat and threaten your children, you get violent minds who see no other way but to threaten other people and perpetrate on them what was done to them by their own parents- yes, its white peoples fault your life sucks.  amazing how many blacks are able to live life like the rest of us in peace . but you cant manage it  so it must be someone elses fault  who do white people blame when their lives suck? C.A.Martin Well Poe just remember there are ten times as many whites (many well armed) as blacks and your not exactly on good terms with the Hispanics as well. Self immolation is just not a good way to go. But go for it, burn baby burn. Maus They will destroy America one liquor store, one Best Buy and one Footlocker at a time!

Zaphod Braden He just qualified  as a DOMESTIC TERRORIST: Hussein Obama claims Congress must do its Constitutional DUTY by accepting his nominee, but Hussein REFUSES to do HIS Constitutional DUTY of evicting illegal invaders and securing OUR borders during a time of war on terror. Hussein is the Chief Executive. Husseins PRIMARY CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY is to enforce the laws, yet he REFUSES to do so. our politicians take oaths to uphold the LAW and the Constitution. When they REFUSE to, when they openly DEFY and circumvent the LAW, they FORFEIT their Governmental Immunity. Every Politician who goes on record as supporting ILLEGAL INVADERS should be held financially responsible for PAYING REPARATIONS for the crimes done by the ILLEGALS. Start CIVIL FORFEITURE on the assets of Politicians that cover for ILLEGAL INVADERS. RESOURCES
8.  . The purpose of  Inform and Influence Operations  is not to provide a perspective, opinion, or lay out a policy. It is defined as the ability to make audiences think and act in a manner favorable to the mission objectives. This is done through applying perception management techniques which target the audiences emotions, motives, and reasoning.These techniques are not geared for debate. It is to overwhelm and change the target psyche. Using these techniques information sources can be manipulated and those that write, speak, or think counter to the objective are relegated as propaganda, ill-informed, or irrelevant. ~ Global Research, US Psychological Warfare in Ukraine . W hat if the strife, rumor, and clamor that the world has seen in the presidential campaign were part and parcel of an Inform and Influence Operation against Americans to determine the election outcome? Bear with me for a moment as I lay out the proofs. The quote above is from an early 2015 article with the author showing what it could look like in the civilian world.  What would we do? Disrupt, deny, degrade, deceive, corrupt, usurp or destroy the information. The information, please dont forget, is the ultimate objective of cyber. That will directly impact the decision-making process of the adversarys leader who is the ultimate target.  Joel Harding IO or IIO (Inform and Influence Operations) as defined by the US Army includes the fields of psychological operations and military deception. All of this is used in the civilian world the same way by private contractors. In this election, private contractors were hired to focus their capacity to influence the American population. This is proven and you deserve a step by step look at it if you are voting. What Project Veritas shows is damning evidence of what I have been documenting in the emigre series articles since spring 2016. By using mainstream media, they started an integrated approach which includes influencing their political opponents decision making. Media is given messages that follow the same themes and fill the entire information space by using an across the board effort. The effort drowns out any other message. According to the Observer, this has been happening throughout the election cycle to benefit Hillary Clinton.  Rather than informing voters to enrich democracy , the mainstream media has developed a feedback loop between support for particular candidates and the political agenda they intend to support. The freedom of the press is necessary for a democracy to function. The article further points out that it was the media that helped rig the primaries against Bernie Sanders. Wikileaks has clearly shown the interplay between mainstream media and the Clinton campaign. And they have shown clearly that most of the mainstream media are working to influence the election . This goes beyond partisan electioneering. All of this follows the exact pattern, a well planned Information Operation against the American public . As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was also the Ex-Officio Board Member of the BBG . The BBG (Broadcasting Board of Governors) run RFE/RL (Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty). Most of the 8-member board, appointed by the President of the United States, are the whos who of powerful media moguls in film, news, print, and radio. Appointment to the BBG is like being awarded an ambassador position for the media industry. Its also why big media carries the same line or themes. The 7th member of the board of directors which runs RFE/RL is Mathew Armstrong . He is a longtime friend and mentor to retired Brigadier general Joel Harding. He provides Harding a lot of access and influence in media. Armstrongs background is public relations. He is an expert in IO and IIO operations. His bio: Author, lecturer, and strategist on public diplomacy and international media . He has worked on traditional and emerging security issues with both civilian and military government agencies, news organizations, think tanks, and academia across several continents. In what appears to be a conflict of interest, at least two BBG board members are working actively for the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign. Karen Kornbluh is helping refine and to get Hillary Clintons message out.  All of them are names to watch if Clinton wins  and key jobs at the FCC and other federal agencies are up for grabs. According to her bio : Karen founded the New America Foundations Work and Family Program and is a senior fellow for Digital Policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Karen has written extensively about technology policy, women, and family policy for The Atlantic , The New York Times and The Washington Post . New York Times columnist David Brooks cited her Democracy article Families Valued, focused on juggler families as one of the best magazine articles of 2006. Michael Kempner is the founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of MWW Group, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, and may get a greater role if she is elected . Kempner is a member of the Public Relations Hall of Fame. Michael Kempner hired Anthony Weiner after the sexting scandal broke in 2011. Jeff Shell, chairman of the BBG and Universal Filmed Entertainment is supporting a secondary role by being an honor roll donor to the Atlantic Council . While the BBG is supposed to be neutral it has continuously helped increase tensions in Eastern Europe. While giving to the Atlantic Council may not be illegal while in his position, currently, the Atlantic Councils main effort is to ignite a war with Russia. This may set up a major conflict of interest. According to journalist Robert Parry The people that will be taking senior positions and especially in foreign policy believe This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East. Parry goes on to say that at the forefront of this is the Atlantic Council, a think tank associated with NATO. Their main goal is a major confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. The Atlantic Council is the think tank for the CEEC (Central and Eastern European Coalition) which is associated with NATO. The CEEC has only one goal. The question it poses to candidates that mattered is Are you willing to go to war with Russia? Hillary Clinton has received their unqualified support throughout the campaign. While the rest of the BBG board support Clintons proposed policy of closing Syrian airspace, the CEEC wants it because it will mean direct conflict with Russia. Hillary Clintons first foray into Islamic politics led to genocide and made the way for ISIS setting up training camps in Kosovo. Hillary Clinton has been friendly with jihadists for as long as she has had a national political career. According to US Special Forces on the ground in Syria training the moderates, there are NO moderates to train . Green Berets are forced to train jihadis that they know will eventually attack us. Support our troops? Give them good, honorable missions. They deserve better, dont they? As you go through the above links, the information is staggering. Shown are large groups of people strategically located in swing states that will do anything to get her elected. The question is why? Politically, we have a two party system. If you say you are Republican, people have at least a general idea of what you mean. For Democrats, its no different. There are different kinds of politics that fit easily under each umbrella. But the point is they are recognizable and we know where they stand on issues. Tell me, what are OUNb beliefs? OUNb is a political party and set of beliefs just like Republican or Democrat. The reason I am asking is that you cant tell me. The odds are you havent heard about it before. When the Atlantic Council or The Project for the New American Century takes all the senior positions in the Clinton White House, it will be filled with OUNb and similar political partisans for the first time without dissenting voices. Unity to act when required has been the diasporas mantra  this cannot be disputed . As time moves on, we see that things take a natural course. We see that two wings of the OUN  (OUNb)Banderivtsi and (OUNm)Melnykivtsi  are working actively on the international level, working in partnership and currently are in strong negotiations about becoming a single entity again. The OUNb political party started under Stepan Bandera and their political beliefs are quite literally Nazi. In the 1930s they swore undying loyalty to Adolf Hitler and the Diaspora was directing Waffen SS battalions from America secretly even as other Ukrainian emigres were fighting them. The UCCA is the head of OUNb thought in America and now they want America to celebrate their totalitarian beliefs with them. If you disagree with totalitarian politics, you are the enemy. After a brief description of what kind of beliefs the people have from the Atlantic Council that are taking up cabinet positions, the proof it is happening now follows. The OUNb were the SS that manned the concentration camps during the Holocaust. They successfully murdered 3 million war prisoners by starving them to death. The OUNb killed over 250,000 Jews, 500,000 Ukrainians, and committed the first Holocaust at Babi Yar. Today the UCCA is funding and running the volunteer battalions raping and killing in Donbass the same way. They and the other emigre group leaders are also behind buying the media headlines and reach, damage control, and the Information Operation against Americans today. If you want to know what American politics will look like within a few years, look at Ukraine. There are people who live abroad, who do not feel fully accepted as a minority, and here there is a phenomenon which I call long-distance nationalism. . .The members of the diaspora create for themselves an image of the home land, which is a stronger emotional investment than the country in which they live One negative consequence of the diaspora experience is the emergence of what Ander-son calls non-responsible politics: diaspora participation in the politics in the country with which they identify can often be toxic, and their impact can be felt through the funding of particular political figures, nationalist propaganda, and even weapons - Multiculturalism, memory, and ritualization: Ukrainian nationalist monuments in Edmonton, Alberta  Pers Anders Rudling With the field day the Emigres and paid media had with Donald Trump over David Duke, they forgot to tell you that Ukrainian emigres supporting Hillary Clinton hired Duke in Ukraine as a professor of history and sent their American kids to learn there. Almost all Ukrainian politicians have been through this fascist education system known as MAUP . The Ukrainian American and other likeminded ethnics are the people that will fill the senior foreign and domestic cabinet positions.  OUNb leader Ivan Kobasa also took responsibility of making sure the Ukrainian-Americans received the proper secondary education at Ukrainian nationalist schools(MAUP) in Ukraine. From the mid-2000s enrollment in this educational system has skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands. Today almost all members of the current Ukrainian government are graduates of this ideological system that was taught to them by moderates like David Duke who is also a graduate of the MAUP system. I do care about social and economic issues affecting every American, but given the war in Ukraine, there is only one issue that we as Ukrainian Americans must focus on: Ukraine . The Ukrainian issue trumps all other personal issues! A vote for Trump is a vote against Ukraine! When it comes to U.S. elections, Ukrainian Americans are a statistically minor, divided, unorganized voting group. The Central and East European Coalition is a coalition of U.S.-based organizations that represent their countries of heritage, a voting group of over 20 million people. The Ukrainian Congress Committee of America and the Ukrainian National Association are member organizations of the CEEC. Americans of East and Central European heritage can make a significant difference and influence the election result if their attention is focused. Ukraine Weekly The Presidential Election: Can We Make A Difference Hillary Clintons response is she will defend Ukraines borders! Even though it has no eastern or northern border to defend. She has guaranteed to start a war with Russia if she is elected. Not only is Clinton buying the media through these second parties, but they are hiring professional, former military psyops professionals to deny pertinent information from voters and disrupt her political opponents message. At the same time, they are paying an across the board mainstream media to simultaneously publish articles and video that lift her campaign up, disrupt, destroy, and drown out alternate messages. Wikileaks noted this when it exposed the Clinton campaigns program to incite violence and obfuscate the point. The Huffington Post example of this is Editors note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar , rampant xenophobe , racist , misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims  1.6 billion members of an entire religion  from entering the U.S.  We understand the Clinton camp has hired beaucoup and Zwanzig (a lot) of trolls, we also understand the Kremlin has done the same. We just do not know if Trump has followed suit. From a counterintelligence perspective, this is confusing as heck. One of the really neat things about this election is seeing all my information operations and information warfare friends on social media, contributing and commenting, looking darned intelligent! Theirs is normally the voice of reason, maturity, and intelligence. Joel Harding By systematically and continually attacking the voters psyche, Americans are being treated in the same way our government treats countries they overthrow . The right to make an informed vote has been denied to support any particular candidate. What does an Inform and Influence Operation entail against the American public? Read the following carefully. The term anti-western refers to anyone that disagrees with whom he is working for. In this case, he works for the Ukrainian Emigres. This also covers Syria. Every media outlet or journalist writing about these subjects that arent carrying the line he lays out is the enemy. These are the tactics being used today during the election. I am building a database of planners , operators, logisticians, hackers, and anyone wanting to be involved with special activities I will call inform and influence activities. I have received a few different suggestions to help organize operations  of all sorts  against anti-Western elements. No government approval, assistance or funding. This skirts legalities. This is not explicitly illegal and it may not even be legal, at this point. That grey area extends a long way. I am only trying to assess the availability of people willing to participate in such efforts. Technology, equipment and facility offers are also appreciated. If you would like to be included in my database, please send a tailored resume to joel harding@ If you dont think this is possible , this has been going on around you for a long time. look at the credentials of retired Brigadier General Joel Harding and decide for yourself. But first look at what he promises he can do for you when you hire him.  Information operations and warfare, also known as influence operations, includes the collection of tactical, operational and strategic information about a competitor as well as the dissemination of information and propaganda in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an competitor or adversary in the corporate, government or military realm. It is our job to maximize your advantages over your competitor while minimizing your competitor. We work on the national level down to the individual level.

Before going further, ask yourself if this is what elections are supposed to be? As a litmus test take Hillarys name out and put down what is known just through Wikileaks in a list. Put McCains name, Kucinich, Paul, Bush, and ask yourself would this be an acceptable candidate? Add whats been shown here. Is there an acceptable candidate? If any of them would be acceptable, sorry like many others you drank the kool-aid already.  Ive seen how our heroes, activists , journalists, and celebrities have completely sold their souls to support something no person with an iota of morality would do. Ive seen them say and do things to derail candidates who would have been a million times better for those less fortunate around us. Its unfortunate most pretend to fight the establishment, to act like they love the people more than they love the struggle and the relevance that it brings them. I am not one of those and I wont continue to be until the good Lord takes me. Cesar Vargas Hillary Clinton is not a Nazi. But every position of relevance will be filled with people that really are political Nazis. They are technically integral nationalists. They look down on democracy in any form. At least now you know what kind of government you are voting for. Regardless of who wins, there are 2000 tanks, artillery, and rockets pointed my way, waiting for this election to be over. I am an American that lives in Donbass, and wrote many of the early breaking stories and much of the background about the conflict in Ukraine. If you cannot objectively look and see a more sophisticated version of what happened here through 2014 is going on, I cant help you. Soon the OUNb will order the volunteer battalions to start killing civilians on a large scale again. I will go back to reporting on the war. If all these things werent being done, I would keep it simply about policy. Russia is not an enemy of the United States. Instead, I believe I am witnessing a quiet coup that demands legality in America. If this Information Operation is allowed to win the 2016 presidency, then elections are fruitless. Every other election will be based on the same strategy. They will have to be for any candidate to win. Your voice, your views, your informed choice will no longer matter. The IIO practitioner kills dissent. Thats their job. Theyre only doing their job. GH Eliason Mr. Eliason l ives in Ukraine.

To consult our Online Interactive I-Book Reader Series, click here. Preface We bring to the attention of our readers Mark Talianos I-Book entitled Syrias War for Humanity . In contrast to most geopolitical analysts of the Middle East, Mark Taliano focusses on what unites humanity with the people of Syria in their struggle against foreign aggression. Author: Mark Taliano Taliano talks and listens to the people of Syria. He reveals the courage and resilience of a Nation and its people in their day to day lives, after more than five years of US-NATO sponsored terrorism and more than two years of US peacemaking airstrikes which have largely targeted Syrias civilian infrastructure. Everybody in Syria knows that Washington is behind the terrorists, that they are financed by the US (at tax payers expense) and its allies, trained and recruited by Americas Middle East partner. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, have been financing and training the ISIS-Daesh, al Nusra terrorists on behalf of the United States. Israel is harboring the terrorists out of the occupied Golan Heights, NATO in liaison with the Turkish high command has since March 2011 been involved in coordinating the recruitment of the jihadist fighters dispatched to Syria. Moreover, the ISIS-Daesh brigades in both Syria and Iraq are integrated by Western special forces and military advisers. While all this is known to the Syrian people, Western public opinion is led to believe that the US is leading a counter-terrorism campaign in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State (ISIS-Daesh), an entity created and supported by US intelligence. Image: Damascus National Museum, M Chossudovsky, 2011 Everything that we saw in Syria speaks of humanitys common heritage, says Mark Taliano. Syria is the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia, the Land of Two Rivers, where the early civilizations of the fertile crescent took their roots. This is what the Washington Neocons want to destroy. But to reach their objective they need to wage a dirty propaganda campaign which conveys the illusion that America is involved in a humanitarian peace-making undertaking. The Syrian people know who the real terrorists are. The Western assault on this country is an assault on our common humanity, and an assault on Syrias progressive and forward-looking future, says Taliano. Mark Taliano focusses on the truth as an instrument for building peace and counter-propaganda: S hould the Wests regime change operations succeed, the secular, pluralist government of President Assad will be replaced by its opposite: a barbaric, sectarian regime, and chaos. Yet Western politicians are seemingly propagandized by their own lies. Or perhaps they see no choice but to cravenly follow diktats from above. Humanitys better nature, however, demands that we all open our eyes, that we learn from history, and that we embrace the rule of international law rather than the diktats of a criminal Empire. Syria and Syrians must be saved, not destroyed. Currently, my interests lie in digging for political truths in a world that is rushing headlong into war and barbarism, on a bedrock of lies. When I find such truths, their trajectories invariably lead to peace rather than war. So now, my crusade is to help share the truth, to make it broad-based, and to make a positive difference. The dirty war on Syria is such a blatant example of the supremacy of war, deception  and evil  over civilization, and our common humanity, that my current research interests are defined by what does or does not happen there. If Syria wins, we all win. Right now, she is winning. Mark Taliano refutes the mainstream media. The causes and consequences of the US-led war on Syria, not to mention the extensive war crimes and atrocities committed by the terrorists on behalf the Western military alliance are routinely obfuscated by the media. Taliano is committed to reversing the tide of media disinformation, by reaching out to Western public opinion on behalf of the Syrian people. Syrias stand against the Western agencies of death and destruction is a stand for all of humanity against the dark forces that fester beneath our politicians empty words and the courtesan medias toxic lies. These twenty-seven chapters of Mark Talianos Syrias War for Humanity provide an overview of life in Syria, the day to day struggle of the Syrian people to protect and sustain their national sovereignty. Michel Chossudovsky, October 30, 2016 * * * Introduction by Mark Taliano I recently traveled to war- torn Syria because I sensed years ago that the official narratives being fed to North Americans across TV screens, in newsprint, and on the internet, were false. The invasion of Libya was based on lies; so was the Iraq war; likewise for Ukraine. All of the 9/11 wars were sold to Western audiences through a sophisticated network of interlocking governing agencies that propagandize both domestic and foreign audiences. But the dirty war on Syria is different. The degree of war propaganda leveled at Syria, and contaminating humanity at this moment, is likely unprecedented. I had already studied and written about Syria for years, so I wasnt entirely surprised by what I saw. But what I felt was a different story. First Impressions When I awoke on the first morning of my visit, and sat at a table on the polished marble floor beside the fountain, it was still and quiet. The walls of the hotel courtyard surrounded me  rows of hard, dark basalt stone block and intricately carved soft brown stone were woven together with alcoves and archways, all radiating ancient artistry. High vaulted windows overlooked the palazzo, with plants flowing from balconies and the railings of the narrow corridors leading to rooms. Above was the pale blue cloudless morning sky. A pigeon lumbered in and perched inside, sheltered by the ancient walls. A native bird, bluish white, swift and silent, swooped in towards the pigeon, and they were both gone, swept away into the Damascene morning. The quiet returned and the pale blue sky became darker and deeper. Syria will find peace again when this is all over. Syria is an ancient land with a proud and forward looking people. To this ancient and holy land we sent mercenaries, and hatred, and bloodshed, and destruction. We sent strange notions of exceptionalism, and waves upon waves of lies. As a visitor I felt shame, but Syrians welcomed me as one of them. This is their story. And these are their voices. Testimonies from Syrians In this video , Dr. Joseph Saddeh, standing in front of desecrated Christian icons in the ancient and holy city of Maaloula, where Aramaic, the language of Jesus, is still spoken, explains that what happened in Syria was not a revolution, and that the terrorists want to destroy everything that is good, and that they want to make us like them or they will kill us. The terrorists did invade this ancient and holy place, they did destroy religious icons, and they did kill many people. Terrorist-damaged religious iconography at Maaloula, Syria Former al Nusra Front Headquarters, Maaloula, Syria Syrian soldier Dr. Ali Salem  a veterinarian during times of peace  explained that terrorists include imports from about 80 countries, street people, thieves, smugglers (diesel fuel and drugs), and those who were forced to fight under the threat of death or the death of family members. He said that by now people must understand the truth about what is happening, despite the propaganda that demonizes the Syrian government and its people. The army is the people, he explained, and the government is not a regime. When this is over, he said, young people will have to be taught the truth about what happened. Terrorist-destroyed Shrine of Saint Takla, Maaloula, Syria. Listen to the video here. Religious icons were either destroyed or burned. We met soft-spoken, accommodating, Dr. Ali Haidar at at his office. He had earlier explained to Jamal Daoud, leader of the Third International Tour of Peace to Syria , that in 2011, he was offered a large sum of money from Qatar to boycott a consultation summit with the government. When he refused the bribe, he received threats, and his son was murdered. The process of national reconciliation, headed by Dr. Haidar, is emblematic of Syrian decision-making processes. The externally-orchestrated war is being resolved internally  by Syrians, for Syrians  and the solutions are often the fruit of a genuine democratic processes, in contrast to the fake democratic processes masquerading as democracy in the West, where Western politicians and citizens are heavily propagandized. All Syrians are paying a horrible price for the sins of the West. Ammar recounted this nightmare: As everyday morning my sister was going to the university when a bloody Takfiri Salafi Wahhabi suicide bomber blew up bomb car at the bus stop which led to the martyrdom and injury of many civilians and university students who were going to their exams, after 10 minutes another suicide bomber blew up himself at the same place taking advantage of the gathering of people and ambulance teams, usually when a terror attack happens we call all family members and friends to make sure they all are ok but this time no one answered! Then we started looking for her in hospitals   the shock was in the bloody views there; many burned bodies and human body parts were on the ground , there i saw my sister a body without soulMadj explained his sentiments:  I am Syrian  living in Syria in the middle of everything. We have seen horrors. It was never a revolution nor a civil war. The terrorists are sent by your government. They are al Qaeda Jabhat al Nusra Wahhabi Salafists Talibans etc and the extremist jihadists sent by the West, the Saudis, Qatar and Turkey. Your Obama and whoever is behind him or above him are supporting al Qaeda and leading a proxy war on my country. We thought you are against al Qaeda and now you support them. The majority here loves Assad. He has never committed a crime against his own people  The chemical attack was staged by the terrorists helped by the USA and the UK, etc. Everyone knows that here. American soldiers and people should not be supporting barbarian al Qaeda terrorists who are killing Christians, Muslims in my country and everyone. Every massacre is committed by them. We were all happy in Syria: we had free school and university education available for everyone, free healthcare, no GMO, no fluoride, no chemtrails, no Rothschild IMF- controlled bank, state owned central bank which gives 11% interest, we are self-sufficient and have no foreign debt to any country or bank. Life before the crisis was so beautiful here. Now it is hard and horrific in some regions. I do not understand how the good and brave American people can accept to bomb my country which has never harmed them and therefore help the barbarian al Qaeda. These animals slit throats and behead for pleasure  they behead babies and rape young kids. They are satanic. Our military helped by the millions of civilian militias are winning the battle against al Qaeda. But now the USA wants to bomb the shit out of us so that al Qaeda can get the upper hand. Please help us American people. They are destroying the cradle of civilization. Stop your government. Impeach that bankster puppet you have as president  support Ron Paul or Rand Paul (as Libertarians they have opposed foreign interventionsEditors) or anyone the like who are true American patriots. but be sure of one.thing if they attack and I think they will .it will be hell. Be sure that if it were to be a world war, many many will die. Syria can and will defend itself and will sink many US ships. Iran will go to war..Russia and China eventually if it escalates  and all this for what ? For the elites who created al Qaeda through the US government and use it to conduct proxy wars and destabilize countries which do not go along with their new world order agenda !!? American people you gotta regain control of your once admirable country. Now everyone hates you for the death you bring almost everywhere. Ask the Iraqis the Afghans the Pakistanis the Palestinians the Syrians the Macedonians and Serbs the Libyans the Somalis the Yemenis  .all the ones you kill with drones everyday. Stop your wars. Enough wars. Use diplomacy dialogue help not force. Jad also shared his tragedy. He told me that his brother was kidnapped last year, and that the terrorists tortured him and destroyed his knees. Now he cant walk. He also told me that his cousin, who was serving in the Syrian Arab Army, lost his leg when Wahhabi suicide bombers attacked his military vehicle, and that another cousin was kidnapped in 2012, and remains in captivity. The tragedies are legion, but all of the Syrians to whom I spoke assured me that they support the government of Bashar Al-Assad. They are unified in the battle against Western terrorists. The sanctions, the terrorists, the death and destruction, are not working. The alternative, a Western-installed Wahhabi stooge government, is not an attractive option. The ongoing dirty war on Syria is particularly odious because the elected President of Syria, Dr. Bashar Al-Assad, and his wife, represent the best of what Syrias future promises to be. The Assads are well-educated  like all of the Syrians whom I had the pleasure of meeting  and they are moving ancient, holy Syria into a better future than that promised by the uni-polar, exceptional imperialists who are trying to destroy Syria with their Wahhabi-inspired terrorists. Syrians have seen the devastation of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and the Ukraine. They refuse to be the next domino. Syrias future will include the rule of international law, nation-state sovereignty, self-determination, pluralism, respect for all people, and multi-polar geo-political relationships. Syria has strong institutions, strong people, a strong military, strong allies, and a strong government; and she will not be pulled into the abyss of terrorism like the other aforementioned countries. For this we should all be grateful. We have just witnessed the pain and hardship that Syria and Syrians are enduring. The next question is, How did the West arrive at the point where otherwise intelligent and morally upright citizens support the illegality and barbarity of their nations foreign policies? The simple answer is that the collective mindset of the public has been contaminated by an unprecedented and on-going propaganda campaign that engineers consent for unspeakable crimes that benefit transnational elites and impoverish the rest of us. [This is the longstanding nature of US foreign policy, dating back more than a century, even prior to the Civil War, when early imperialist and Manifest Destiny believer James Polk seized half of Mexico under trumped-up pretexts and false flags. Meanwhile, the American media have always supported these international crimes, as they do today.Editors.] The dreadful reality is that the Global War on Terror is actually a global war for terror. The foreign policies of Western nations are increasing the reach of terrorism exponentially, because the West uses these terror brigades as foot soldiers for illegal wars of aggression. In its Syrian campaign, as with its previous Libyan campaign, the West is literally the air force for the terrorists on the ground. This is all well documented with Western sources. US-led NATO is aligned with the Gulf Monarchies, and Israel, to flood Syria with mercenary terrorists, to balkanize and destroy the country, and to remove President Assad, so that it can advance its agenda for a New World Order of conquest under the false banner of the Global War On Terror (GWOT). Through its actions and inactions, its sanctions, its arms dealings, and its pre-planned invasions, the West and the terrorists in Syria are one and the same. We support all the imaginary moderates, and every other terrorist organization operating in Syria. Again, the evidence is ample, and well-documented using western sources. US-led NATO is aligned with the Gulf Monarchies, and Israel, to flood Syria with mercenary terrorists, to balkanize and destroy the country, and to remove President Assad, so that it can advance its agenda for a New World Order of conquest under the false banner of the Global War On Terror (GWOT). This on-going project necessarily entails death, destruction, and wide-spread poverty. Neo-con planners hope that the widespread destruction will enable them to control destroyed countries and open them up for predatory and parasitical economic programs  similar to domestic neoliberal economic models that are ravaging domestic economies beneath the lies and diversions. Despotic stooge puppet regimes are easier to control and manipulate than independent sovereign governments that represent the democratic will of their peoples and the rule of international law. Again, this favoured totalitarian style rule is mirrored at home, but more subtly. The notion that we live in democracies is absurd. Tentacles of predatory neoliberal capitalism have yet to invade Syrias famous souks/markets Spices at the Souk F alse flag terrorism is part of the apparatus of deception which serves to advance policies that are contrary to the wishes of those who are deceived.Theres nothing new about synthetic terrorism; it is military doctrine, and examples of its use are legion, but it is a taboo topic and a conspiracy theory, so it works. The Canada Day pressure-cooker bomber plot was a proven false flag (though not acknowledged as such by mainstream media), and it served the apparatus of deception as did other domestic terrorism cases. Even if the Ottawa shooting crisis unfolded exactly as the official narratives described it, the conflation between the shooting and ISIS is surely unfounded, as noted by Senator Mobina Jaffer. But the accumulated impact of these events, coupled with largely unquestioned official narratives, has the intended effect of creating a consensus of ignorance wherein otherwise intelligent people support illegal warfare, terrorism, and police state legislation. Preeminent Constitutional lawyer Rocco Galati assesses Canadas C-51 legislation in these words : It takes all our private information and shares it with all government agencies, including foreign government. For some citizens that becomes an eventuality of torture and/or death when travelling abroad. It restricts arbitrarily who can travel. Freedom of expression and political criticism with respect to terrorism and the governments role (becomes) a terrorist offence in itself. So words and thoughts become an act of terrorism under this bill. It allows CSIS to disrupt covertly constitutionally-protected rights of association, expression, and protest. It does all of this by taking away all and any transparent judicial oversight. He says that Weve entered into the final fascist state. Consequently, both domestically and abroad, we are living what author Naomi Wolf describes as a fascist shift , wherein we unwittingly embrace our own enslavement, global war, and poverty, all for the benefit of transnational oligarch classes, and the known catastrophic impacts for humanity. Syria is standing strong against these Western cancers of ignorance and evil. She, and her allies, are swooping down on these globalist interlopers. Her victory will be our victory. Outline of This Book T he purpose of this book is to shed some light on how the propaganda works, and to decode it and other events, so that we can arrive at a better understanding of what is really happening in Syria, and why.The degree of war propaganda leveled at Syria, and contaminating humanity at this moment is unprecedented. I have yet to meet a single Syrian who would prefer a stooge, Wahhabi dictatorship to the current government. Every single Syrian opposition leader prefers the current government to an imperial -imposed government. The on-going campaign of lies directed at Syria is particularly odious because the elected President of Syria, Dr. Bashar Al-Assad, and his wife, represent the best of what Syrias future promises to be. The Assads are well-educated  like all of the Syrians whom I had the pleasure of meeting  and they are moving ancient, holy Syria into a better future than that promised by the uni-polar, exceptional imperialists who are trying to destroy Syria with their Wahhabi-inspired terrorists. Syrians have seen the devastation of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, and the Ukraine. They refuse to be the next domino. Syrians are unified. Their future will include the rule of international law, nation-state sovereignty, self-determination, pluralism, respect for all people, and multi-polar geo-political relationships. Syria has strong institutions, strong people, a strong military, strong allies, and a strong government; she will not be pulled into the abyss of terrorism like the other aforementioned countries. The compilation of articles in this book decode the propaganda apparatus which creates an engineered consensus that serves the covert agenda of expanding the parasitical economic model called neoliberalism. Neoliberalism impoverishes domestic and foreign populations, and enriches a transnational oligarch class. The transnational oligarch class  enriched by deregulation, privatization schemes, and free trade agreements  contaminates the collective mindset of humanity with its foundations, its lobbying, and its undue influence, so its real nature, and its very existence, remains hidden. Rarely will a mainstream publication even use the word neoliberalism, which is the economic foundation of the current class system. Part One is the story of Syria as told by Syrians, unfiltered by mainstream media (MSM) propaganda. We see and hear the trauma lived by defiant, heroic Syrians, and we discover that this ancient, holy land will surely survive the current barbarian invasion, and will rise again as a beacon of civilization, hope, and dignity, in contrast to so many of those countries that seek to destroy it. Voices from Syrian citizens are absent from mainstream media stories. Syrians are like you and me. This is what they have to say: We thought you are against al Qaeda and now you support them. I Am A Syrian Living in Syria: It was Never a Revolution nor a Civil War. The Terrorists are sent by your Government The externally-orchestrated war is being resolved internally  by Syrians, for Syrians  and the solutions are often the fruit of a genuine democratic processes, in contrast to the fake democratic processes masquerading as democracy in the West, where Western politicians and citizens are heavily propagandized. NATO et al. terrorists destroy everything that contradicts their deviant ideology. They seek a blank slate that denies and negates the real Syria. Syria insists on being a sovereign nation; it refuses Empires head-chopping criminality. Syria was prosperous, with a growing economy. It had food sovereignty, with a strategic stock of millions of tons of high quality wheat , not the Franken-food bio-tech variety; it had a strong central bank with no usurious IMF loans ; it had a popular, reformer President; it had a mostly well-educated, secular, pluralist, forward-looking population; and it was the fourth safest country in the world. Part Two elaborates upon the real story about Syria, and the drivers behind the current dirty war, in which the U.S-led Empire is using terror proxies to advance its predatory reach, contrary to the wishes of the vast majority of Syrians. The alternative to Syrias elected government is genocidal despotism and Sharia law. The (non-existent) moderates cant be separated from the extremists, because all of the mercenary terrorists share the same goals and the same ideologies. The predictable result of engineered deception is that domestic Western populations remain deceived and politically passive. The truth is inverted, and large swaths of the population remain deluded. Whereas the West and its allies support all the terrorists invading Syria, domestic populations think that we are fighting terrorism. This is the great fraud of the Global War On Terror. The West uses mercenary terrorist proxies to advance its predatory reach; to destroy foreign countries; and to increase global terrorism exponentially, all for the benefit of the oligarch classes. There is nothing new about this. The secular governments of Iraq, Libya, and Syria all  prior to Western invasions  opposed terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda.

Originally appeared at Strategic Culture Foundation T he Obama administration is now accusing Russia of cyber-crime and trying to disrupt the US presidential election. The claim is so far-fetched, it is hardly credible. More credible is that the US is reeling from Putins stunning humiliation earlier this week. Since June, US media and supporters of Democrat presidential contender Hillary Clinton have been blaming Russian state-sponsored hackers for breaking into the Democratic partys database. It is further alleged that Moscow is stealthily trying to influence the outcome of the election, by releasing damaging information on Clinton, which might favor Republican candidate Donald Trump. Russia has vehemently denied any connection to the cyber-crime charges, or trying to disrupt the November poll. Now the Obama administration has stepped into the fray by openly accusing Russia. US government officially accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections, reported the Washington Post. This takes the row to a whole new level. No longer are the insinuations a matter of private, partisan opinion. The US government is officially labelling the Russian state for cyber-crime and political subversion. Predictably, following the latest allegations, there are calls among American lawmakers for ramping up more economic sanctions against Russia. While US intelligence figures are urging for retaliatory cyber-attacks on Russian government facilities. Vladimir Putins spokesman Dmitry Peskov derided the US claims as rubbish. He noted that the Kremlins computer system incurs hundreds of hacking attempts every day, many of which can be traced to American origin, but Moscow doesnt turn around and blame the US government for such cyber-attacks. There are several signs that the latest brouhaha out of Washington is a bogus diversion. A s with previous Russian-hacker claims by the Democrats and US media, there is no evidence presented by the Obama administration to support its grave allegations against the Russian government. Assertion without facts does not meet a minimal standard of proof. When reports emerged in June  again through the Washington Post  that the Democrat National Committee (DNC) was hacked by Russian agents, the allegation relied on investigations by a private cyber security firm by the name of CrowdStrike. The firm is linked by personnel to the NATO-affiliated, anti-Russian think tank Atlantic Council. Again no verifiable evidence was presented then, just the word of a dubious partisan source. Scoundrels like John Podesta, a filthy DNC apparatchik, are naturally throwing more fuel on the flames. Back then the Russian scare story, for thats what it was, served as a useful diversion from far more important issues. Such as the 19,000 emails released from the DNC database showing that the party chiefs had preordained Clintons presidential nomination over her Democrat rival Bernie Sanders. Much-vaunted US democracy was exposed as a fraud, and so the Washington establishment quickly went into damage-limitation mode by smearing Russia. It was the whistleblower site Wikileaks, run by Australian journalist Julian Assange, that released the embarrassing emails. It   Russia. Assange has since hinted that his source was within the Democrat party itself. This is where it gets really explosive. Assange has vowed to release more emails that will prove that Clinton as Secretary of State back in 2011-2012 masterminded the supply of weapons and money to Islamist terror networks in Libya and Syria for the objective of regime change. Furthermore, Assange says that the emails prove that Clinton lied under oath to Congress when she denied in 2013 that she was had any involvement in facilitating arms to the jihadists. Assange has said that Wikileaks is going to publish the incriminating emails on Clintons alleged gun-running to terrorists this month. If the evidence stands up, Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury as well as treason in aiding and abetting official terrorist enemies of the US. The exposure of an American presidential candidate as being involved in state sponsorship of terrorism while serving as a top government official is a powerful incentive for the Obama administration to find a lurid diversion. Hence, the latest charges by the US government against Russia as perpetrating cyber-crime and of trying to subvert American democracy. This is just one more illustration of how irrational and unhinged the US government has become. Day by day, it seems, leads to more damning revelations of Washingtons complicity in illegal wars, covert subversion of foreign states, and systematic collusion with terrorist networks which have inflicted thousands of deaths on American citizens, among many more thousands of other innocent civilians around the world. In addition to exposure by sources like Wikileaks, much of revelation about US criminality and state-sponsored banditry has emerged from Russias principled   Syria. Russias intervention has not only helped salvage the Syrian nation from a foreign conspiracy of covert war for regime change. Russias intervention has also brought into clear focus the systematic links between Washington and its terrorist proxy army working on its behalf in Syria. Washingtons mask of moral and legal superiority has been ripped from its face. And what the world is seeing is the vile ugliness beneath. Such is Washingtons ignominious fall from pretend-grace to its grim, odious reality that Vladimir Putin this week was empowered to speak from the moral high ground. In announcing Russias unilateral suspension of a 2002 accord with the US for the disposal of nuclear-weapon-grade plutonium, Putin went much, much further. He gave Washington a list of ultimatums that included the US ending its trumped-up sanctions against Russia, with financial compensation, as well as the scaling back of NATO forces from Russias border. In other words, the Russian leader was talking truth to American power in a way that megalomaniac Washington, with all its ridiculous delusions of exceptionalism, has never ever heard before. American pretensions of greatness are eroding like a castle built on sand. Washingtons criminal enterprises and specifically the complicity in terrorism for the supreme crime of foreign aggression are being glaringly exposed. And now with due contempt, Russia is putting manners on Washington. It must be excruciating the humiliation for the narcissistic American tyrant to be treated with the disrespect that it deserves and which is long overdue. Moreover, the humiliation is not just in the eyes of the world. The American people can see the true ugly nature of their rulers too. When a giant banner declaring Putin a peacemaker was unfurled off Manhattan bridge in New York City this weekend, the popular enthusiasm went viral. Washington is reeling from Putins righteous courage to call it out for what it is. The truth-telling is hard to take for this unipolar unicorn. Its deluded myth-making about its own virtues are being stripped bare. Whats going on here is a world-class, historic exposure of American power as a nefarious excrescence on humanity. The reaction is understandable: foaming-at-the-mouth, desperate, hysterical and panicked. Accusing Russia of hacking into the American democratic process is a wild attempt to divert from the paramount issues: Washingtons exposed descent into a vile morass of its own making; the emperor is a criminal; the people know it; and a genuine world leader like Vladimir Putin has the temerity to lay it on the line to this has-been.

Share This: PATRICE GREANVILLE T he problem is that, while helpful to have the empires managers show their true sociopathic face, her narrative is a distorted simplification bearing all the vices of her political prejudices and ignorance, the script favored by the US ruling class. Consider just one of her major lies, tossed about casually and sure to be swallowed whole by the perennially clueless audience: That The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan  The USSR did not invade Afghanistan . The besieged, progressive and modernising Kabul governmenta leftwing government that promptly moved to advance literacy, gave women full and unrestricted civil rights, and in general was trying to bring the nation out of the middle ages (program which Washington could care less), invited the Soviets to come in, as it was meeting stiff resistance to its reforms by the entrenched landlords and reactionary clerics in the countryside. Moscow accepted the invitation because it also suited its valid objective of not allowing the Americans to plant another huge military base on the Central Asia underbelly, part of the encirclement of Russia the US has been carrying out for many decades. The invitation is similar and as genuine as the invitation by the Government of Syria, today, to come in and fight against the Western-sponsored terrorists, an authority to set foot on Syrian soil which the Americans and their multiple sordid accomplices in mayhem in the Middle East, totally lack. Contrast this with Washingtons actions in Vietnam, where it first refused to recognize the right of the newly independent Vietnamese to a free election (since they knew the communists led by Ho Chi Minh would win by a huge margin), and then simply invaded that nation under trumped up pretexts (Gulf of Tonkin, etc.).The closer you inspect the US government narrative, the clearer it becomes it is a tissue of cynical big lies, word-twistings, professional pr.r. spin, and self-serving myths and simplificationsall in the service of sordid and criminal goals the elites can never admit to the American public.PHOTOS: AboveAfghan women college students, a total novelty in Kabul, sporting Western dress, etc. (1978). Afghan women studying, as equals, in Kabul, 1979. The communist government in power then (PDPA, the Peoples Democratic party of Afghanistan) actually liberated Afghan women from centuries old customs that effectively enslaved them to husband and society. As usual, Western bourgeois feminists have said virtually nothing about the tremendous losses suffered by women and children as a result of Washingtons intervention in Afghanistan on the side of the most reactionary sectors of society.

The Anti-Empire Report #146 By William Blum  Published November 6th, 2016 L ouis XVI needed a revolution, Napoleon needed two historic military defeats, the Spanish Empire in the New World needed multiple revolutions, the Russian Czar needed a communist revolution, the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires needed World War I, Nazi Germany needed World War II, Imperial Japan needed two atomic bombs, the Portuguese Empire in Africa needed a military coup at home, the Soviet Empire needed Mikhail Gorbachev   What will the American Empire need? ABOVE: Nuremberg tribunal. A new one is in order to try most of the political leaders, CEOs, media barons and their prostitutes, and similar agents of domination, exploitation, endless war, and imperialism for the past 100 years. I dont believe anyone will consciously launch World War III. The situation now is more like the eve of World War I, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. Ever since Gorbachev naively ended the Cold War, the hugely over-armed United States has been actively surrounding Russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, NATO expansion. At the same time, in recent years the demonization of Vladimir Putin has reached war propaganda levels. Russians have every reason to believe that the United States is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. This mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an evil enemy make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up.  Diana Johnstone, author of Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton ALL IN THE FAMILY Just pals, all of them, just pals. Its all been such a joyful ride. Obviously neither Clinton, nor Obama, or Carter, find anything amiss in celebrating George W Bush, one of the worst criminals in modern history. (George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on the campus of Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas, April 25, 2013. Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) In September 2013 President Obama stood before the United Nations General Assembly and declared, I believe America is exceptional. The following year at the UN, the president classified Russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the Islamic State and the ebola virus. On March 9, 2015 President Barack Obama declared Venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Vladimir Putin, speaking at the UN in 2015, addressing the United States re its foreign policy: Do you realize what you have done? Since the end of World War 2, the United States has: Attempted to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments, most of which were democratically-elected. Dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries. Attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders. Attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries. Grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries.* Plus   although not easily quantified   has been more involved in the practice of torture than any other country in the world   for over a century   not just performing the actual torture, but teaching it, providing the manuals, and furnishing the equipment. *See chapter 18 of William Blum, Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only Superpower On October 28, 2016 Russia was voted off the UN Human Rights Council. At the same time Saudi Arabia won a second term, uncontested. Does anyone know George Orwells email address? A million refugees from Washingtons warfare are currently over-running Europe. Theyre running from Afghanistan and Iraq; from Libya and Somalia; from Syria and Pakistan. Germany is taking in many Syrian refugees because of its World War Two guilt. What will the United States do in the future because of its guilt? But Americans are not raised to feel such guilt.  The Plan is for the United States to rule the world. The overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. It calls for the United States to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. It calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. It says not that the United States must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful. Vice-President Dick Cheney  West Point lecture, June 2002 Two flew over the cuckoos nest: We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known.   security and freedom for millions of people around the globe have depended on Americas military , economic, political, and diplomatic might.  Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, Why the world needs a powerful America (2015) State Department spokesperson Mark Toner: Assad must go even if Syria goes with him. Many of the moves the Obama administration has made in terms of its Cuba policy are in lockstep with Bill Clintons, as expressed in the recommendations of a 1999 task force report from the Council on Foreign Relations. The report asserted that no change in policy should have the primary effect of consolidating, or appearing to legitimize, the political status quo on the island. A successful American regime change operation in Syria would cut across definite interests of the Russian state. These include the likely use of Syria as a new pipeline route to bring gas from Qatar to the European market, thereby undercutting Gazprom, Russias largest corporation and biggest exporter. Assads refusal to consider such a route played no small role in Qatars pouring billions of dollars in arms and funds into the Syrian civil war on behalf of anti-Assad forces. War with Russia will be nuclear. Washington has prepared for it. Washington has abandoned the ABM treaty, created what it thinks is an ABM shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit US nuclear first strike. All of this is obviously directed at Russia, and the Russian government knows it. How long will Russia sit there waiting for Washingtons first strike?  Paul Craig Roberts, 2014 Iran signed the nuclear accords with the United States earlier this year by agreeing to stop what it never was doing. Any Iranian nuclear ambition, real or imagined, is of course a result of American hostility towards Iran, and not the other way around. If the European Union were an independent and rational government it would absolutely forbid any member country from stockpiling American nuclear weapons or hosting a US anti-ballistic missile site or any other military base anywhere close to Russias borders. Full Spectrum Dominance , a term the Pentagon loves to use to refer to total control of the planet: land, sea, air, space, outer space and cyberspace. Can you imagine any other country speaking this way? Henry Kissinger at the Paris Peace Talks, September 1970. I refuse to believe that a little fourth rate power like North Vietnam does not have a breaking point. In 2010, WikiLeaks released a cable sent to US embassies by then- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She wrote this: Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, al Nusra and other terrorist groups   worldwide. Surely this resulted in at least Washingtons much-favored weapon: sanctions of various kinds. It did not. US General Barry McCaffrey , April 2015: Because so far NATOs reaction to Putins aggression (sic) has been to send a handful of forces to the Baltics to demonstrate resolve, which has only convinced Putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. So we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest Putins stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to protect Russia-speaking people. For Gods sake, the last time we heard that was just before Hitler invaded the Sudetenland. No, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1978 when the United States invaded the tiny nation of Grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of Americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. It was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that didnt believe that the American Empire was Gods gift to humanity. Since 1980, the United States has intervened in the affairs of fourteen Muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. They are (in chronological order) Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo, Yemen, Pakistan, and now Syria. How our never-ending mideast horror began: Radio Address of George W. Bush, September 28, 2002: The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year. Yet   just six weeks before 9/11, Condoleezza Rice told CNN: Lets remember that his [Saddams] country is divided, in effect. He does not control the northern part of his country. We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt. The fact is that there is more participation by the Cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the American population in the running of theirs. One important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the United States, exert great influence over all aspects of life. The U.S. is frantically surrounding China with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines through several nearby smaller Pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in Australia   The U.S. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol Chinas nearby waters. Warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon. (Jack A. Smith, Hegemony Games: USA vs. PRC, CounterPunch) Crimea had never voluntarily left Russia. The USSRs leader Nikita Khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia after the US-induced Ukrainian coup in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin refers to the Ukrainian army as NATOs foreign legion, which does not pursue Ukraines national interests. The United States, however, insists on labeling the Russian action in Crimea as an invasion. Putin re Crimea/Ukraine: Our western partners (sic) created the Kosovo precedent with their own hands. In a situation absolutely the same as the one in Crimea they recognized Kosovos secession from Serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a countrys central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary  And the UN International Court of Justice agreed with those arguments. Thats what they said; thats what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to accept  and now they are complaining about Crimea. Why is that? Paul Craig Roberts: The absurdity of it all! Even a moron knows that if Russia is going to put tanks and troops into Ukraine, Russia will put in enough to do the job. The war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. As Putin himself said some months ago, if the Russian military enters Ukraine, the news will not be the fate of Donetsk or Mauriupol, but the fall of Kiev and Lviv. In a major examination of US policy vis--vis China, published in March 2015, the authoritative Council on Foreign Relations bluntly declared that there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, peaceful coexistence, mutual understanding, a strategic partnership, or a new type of major country relations between the United States and China. The United States, the report declares, must, therefore, develop the political will and military capabilities to deal with China to protect vital U.S. interests. John F. Kennedy changed the mission of the Latin American military from hemispheric defense  an outdated relic of World War II  to internal security, which means war against the domestic population.  Noam Chomsky Cuban baseball players who are paid a million dollars to play for an American team are not defectors, a word which has a clear political connotation. Boris Yeltsin was acceptable to American and Europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed Western capital free rein in the newly opened Russian territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsins era was also a time of rampant corruption by Russian oligarchs who were closely associated with Western capital. That corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of Vladimir Putin twice as president between 2000-2008, and again in 2012. Many ISIS leaders were former Iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by American troops. The fight isnt against ISIS, its against Assad; at the next level it isnt against Assad, its against Putin; then, at the next level, it isnt against Putin, its against the country most likely to stand in the way of US world domination, Russia. And its forever. Connecting to the US-based Internet would mean channeling all of Cubas communications directly to the NSA. George W. Bush has been living a comparatively quiet life in Texas, with a focus on his paintings. Im trying to leave something behind, he said a couple of years ago. Yeah, right, George. We can stand up some of the paintings against the large piles of Iraqi dead bodies. Seymour Hirsch: America would be much better off, if, 30 years ago, we had let Russia continue its war in Afghanistan   The mistake was made by the Carter administration which was trying to stop the Russians from their invasion (sic) of Afghanistan. Wed be better off had we let the Russians beat the Taliban. ( Deutsche Welle , April 2, 2014 interview) Wed be even better off if we hadnt overthrown the progressive, secular Afghan government, giving rise to the Taliban in the first place and inciting the Russians to intervene on their border lest the Soviet Islamic population was stirred up. The former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in an interview in 1998 summed up exactly what the US thinks of the UN: The UN plays a very important role. But if we dont like it, we always have the option of following our own national security interests, which I assure you we will do if we dont like whats going on. She is now a foreign-policy advisor to Hillary Clinton. A leader taking his (or her) nation to war is as dysfunctional in the family of humankind as an abusive parent is in an individual family.  Suey Kane It would be some time before I fully realized that the United States sees little need for diplomacy. Power is enough. Only the weak rely on diplomacy   The Roman Empire had no need for diplomacy. Nor does the United States.  Boutros Boutros-Ghali , Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1992 to December 1996 Interventions are not against dictators but against those who try to distribute: not against Jimnez in Venezuela but Chvez, not against Somoza in Nicaragua but the Sandinistas, not against Batista in Cuba but Castro, not against Pinochet in Chile but Allende, not against Guatemala dictators but Arbenz, not against the shah in Iran but Mossadegh, etc.  Johan Galtung, Norwegian, principal founder of the discipline of peace and conflict studies No mention was made that Iraqs Christians had been safe and sound under President Saddam Hussein  even privileged  until President George Bush invaded and destroyed Iraq. We can expect the same fate for Syrias Christians if the protection of the Assad regime is torn away by the US-engineered uprising. We will then shed crocodile tears for Syrias Christians.  Eric Margolis, 2014 Jewish Power is the capacity to silence the debate on Jewish Power.  Gilad Atzmon We need a trial to judge all those who bear significant responsibility for the past century  the most murderous and ecologically destructive in human history. We could call it the war, air and fiscal crimes tribunal and we could put politicians and CEOs and major media owners in the dock with earphones like Eichmann and make them listen to the evidence of how they killed millions of people and almost murdered the planet and made most of us far more miserable than we needed to be. Of course, we wouldnt have time to go after them one by one. Wed have to lump Wall Street investment bankers in one trial, the Council on Foreign Relations in another, and any remaining Harvard Business School or Yale Law graduates in a third. We dont need this for retribution, only for edification. So there would be no capital punishment, but rather banishment to an overseas Nike factory with a vow of perpetual silence.  Sam Smith I have come to think of the export of democracy as the contemporary equivalent of what missionaries have always done in the interest of conquering and occupying the uncivilized world on behalf of the powers that be. I have said that the church invented the concept of conversion by any means, including torture and killing of course, as doing the victims a big favor, since it was in the interest of saving their immortal souls. It is now called, democratization.  Rita Corriel It is more or less impossible to commemorate the war dead without glorifying them, and it is impossible to glorify them without glorifying their wars.

The result of the 2016 election has thrown this country for a loop. Some celebrate the win of President-elect Donald Trump while others continue to mourn the current presidents ultimate transition of power. A number of Americans are excited to see what a non-politician will do in a political environment, while others are worried that he will maintain the antics that awarded him the Oval Office. The country continues to experience a great divide that has many Americans trapped between fear and faith.The previous perspective of the nation, according to some, included a series of victories and a country on an incline. However, others disagree by saying President Barak Obama is the worst thing to ever happen to the White House. Ironically, many of these same people believe racism did not exist until he became president. In the same vein, others feel the division crisis, which includes race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation among other issues will increase with the induction of Trump as the leader of the free world. Today, America is shrouded in a most un-American pessimism as many within this great country remain trapped between fear and faith.On one side of the divide, there are people who are fed up with the mistreatment and injustice they have experienced. These millennials have decided to take matters into their own hands with protests and other questionable behavior patterns. Undoubtedly, if hope continues to decrease, violence will increase and blood will continue to spill in the earth. On the other side, there are people who embrace the faith of a changed country made great again with the entrance of new authority. As such, Trump serves as a beacon of hope to his core supporters. He seemingly indulges their ambitions to maintain Americas system of oppression and inspires them in dangerous ways that have the potential to lead to serious consequences. Instead of seeking unity, Americans from all sides are fighting to be right. However, when hate overpowers love, no one is right.In order to understand the fear surrounding the election results, a conversation would need to take place in search of real issues. Not enough people are interested in problem-solving. Onlookers who criticize and judge a generation that is destroying their town as they march through the streets, only serve as fuel for their fury. People have called them animals and all sorts of derogatory statements, without realizing that it is a terrible thing to feel trapped or caged. Before adding insult to injury, it may help if outsiders were more empathetic to their experience.The crisis of America will not change simply by the transference of power; it can only be made better by the conveyance of love. It is time for Americans join together and bridge the gap between fear and faith with the spread love as they continue to seek change. Otherwise, things will get worse.In many corners of the country and across the globe, the calamity has been met with love, compassion, and sympathy as people from all lifestyles join in a time of celebration and mourning. Even still, if people are not careful hate will find a way to slide through the cracks. However, if given the chance love will always prevail.Peoples view of the election is based on their experiences. Allow them to embrace their feelings and encourage them to find peace. Today the sitting President and President-elect met for the first time and did just that! Why? Because love still trumps hate.Opinion by  (Virginia) Politicus USA: Trump Supporters Saying Give Him A Chance Forget How They Treated President ObamaTop Image Courtesy of Max Goldberg  Flickr LicenseInline Image Courtesy of DonkeyHotey  Flickr LicenseFeatured Image Courtesy of KAZ Vorpal  Flickr License    America , election , Hope , Protests
 October 31, 2016 Google + They both love to play the gender card, turning their immense privilege into victim status and  dividing the electorate by sex.Thus, Gillard nobbled Tony  Abbott with her fabled misogyny speech and Clintons machine manages to drown out every Wikileaks embarrassment with a new Donald Trump bimbo eruption. The other thing the two ladies have in common is the Clinton Foundation , which Wikileaks emails now show is an influence-peddling political slush fund. And guess which country was one of its biggest donors? Australia. Yep, were up there with Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The Australian taxpayer shovelled at least $88 million into the Clinton Foundation and associated entities from 2006 to 2014, reaching a peak of $10.3 million in 2012-13, Gillards last year in office. Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard both involved in the influence-peddling political slush fund that is the Clinton Foundation. On the Clinton Foundation website, AusAID and the Commonwealth of Australia score separate entries in the $10 million-plus group of donors, one rung up from American teacher unions. In 2009-10 Kevin Rudd handed over another $10 million to the foundation for climate research, part of $300 million he squandered on a Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute. Gillard also donated $300 million of our money to the Clinton-affiliated Global Partnership for Education. Lo and behold, she became chairman in 2014 and has been  actively promoting Clinton as president ever since  in a campaign video last December slamming Trump, in opeds trumpeting the next woman president and in appearances with Clinton spruiking girls education. The Abbott government topped up the left-wing organisations coffers with another $140 million in 2014, bringing total Australian largesse to $460 million, according to a press release from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. And yet, apart from the beautiful friendship with Gillard, what did Australia get from the Clintons for all that cash? A whole lot of trouble is what. The latest treasure trove of Wikileaks emails released last week shows that Australian green groups have been secretly funded to destroy our coal industry by environmental activists connected to the Clinton campaign. Apart from the friendship between Hillary Clinton and Julia Gillard, what does Australia get from the Clinton Foundation for donating all that cash? A whole lot of trouble is what. The email account of Clintons campaign chairman John Podesta reveals extraordinary details of the sabotage of the $16 billion Adani coalmine in Queensland, which has damaged Australias national interest and denied cheap electricity to millions of poor Indians. Last August John Hepburn, former Greenpeace activist and founder of Australian anti-coal group the Sunrise Project, sent a crowing email to his American paymasters, the Sandler Foundation, which is also a major donor to the Clinton Foundation. (Founder Herb Sandler and mate George Soros funded another Clinton-aligned progressive group, the Centre for American Progress, previously chaired by Podesta.) The Adani Carmichael mine and the whole Galilee Basin fossil fuel industrial complex is in its death throes, Hepburn wrote in the email forwarded to Podesta. I am going to buy a few bottles of bubbly for a celebration with the (Environmental  Defenders Office) legal team, our colleagues at GetUp, Greenpeace, 350.org, ECF, Australian Youth Climate Coalition, Mackay Conservation Group, Market Forces and the brilliant and tireless Sunrise team. In another email forwarded to Podesta, Hepburn panics about an Abbott government inquiry into environmental charities and discusses hiding Sunrises sources of funding to safeguard its charitable tax status. Hepburn boasts about the latest legal blow to Adani, when the Federal Court overturned its approval and the Commonwealth Bank quit the project. In it he now wants to escalate the campaign  towards the other 3 big Australian banks. And he mocks miners who try to claim that there is some kind of foreign-funded and tightly orchestrated conspiracy to systematically  destroy the Australian coal industry. (I seriously dont know where they get these wacky ideas from!) As if its not bad enough that foreign-funded activists are meddling with our largest export earner, Podestas emails also detail their insidious influence on indigenous land owners who blocked the Adani mine using powerful native title rights. This alliance of green groups with native title owners is a frightening development detailed in a new book by historian Keith Windschuttle, The Break-up of Australia: The Real Agenda behind Aboriginal Recognition. He reveals the imminent expansion of native title claims, either  approved or quietly being processed, stretch across a whopping 60 per cent of the Australian continent, an area twice the size of Western Europe. Already 6000sq km of the Kidman cattle empire in the Kimberley has been given, via native title, to green activists to be converted from productive cattle country to a wildlife conservation area. In return, the Yulumbu people get a paltry $50,000 a year royalty, Windschuttle writes. As a flora and fauna sanctuary it is economically defunct for the foreseeable future. At worst, writes Windschuttle, the upcoming referendum for indigenous constitutional recognition, proposed by Gillard in 2012, could pave the way for a separate Aboriginal state on native title land, funded by taxation, royalties and lease payments  passive welfare in another guise. At the very least, the  alliance between foreign- funded green groups and  indigenous owners gives  environmentalists the opportunity to take whole swathes of Australia out of the productive economy and shut down industries they dont like, from coal mines in Queensland to cattle farms in Western Australia. Thanks for nothing, Hillary and Julia.
 Will years of alleged fraud at the CDC get more attention in the Trump administration? 7 reasons CDC employees should be crying in the hallways PORTLAND, Oregon   Question : The day after Donald Trumps unexpected win in the presidential election last week, how many government agencies had reports in the media of their employees crying in the hallways? Answer : Exactly one. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which is based in Atlanta, GA. As a long-time critic of the CDC, I was pretty shocked to see this headline last week, courtesy of Atlantas NPR radio station, 90.1 WABE: Atlanta CDC Employees Express Anxiety Over Trumps Win The story detailed the climate at CDC the day after the election: At the General Muir deli across the street from the CDC, a few employees talked to WABE, asking that their names not be used. One microbiologist said her colleagues were crying in the hallways. Its really sad, she said. Its depressing. Im eating a bagel to try and be happy. See: http://news.wabe.org/post/atlanta-cdc-employees-express-anxiety-over-trumps-win The average voter  even a Trump supporter  probably has no idea why CDC employees might be crying in the hallways, while the average autism parent (meaning those of us who have children with autism) like me understands it perfectly. Frankly, its pretty hard for me to write about the CDC without shaking with at least a little bit of rage. On the off chance this is your first time considering this topic, Ill steady my hands and explain it to you: Source: learntherisk.org The CDC is in charge of recommending the vaccination schedule for U.S. children, which has grown from 5 total doses in the 1960s to more than 70 today. The CDC is ALSO in charge of monitoring vaccine safety for those more than 70 doses. In an ironic twist (at least for parents like me), the CDC is ALSO in charge of tracking the number of children with Autism in the U.S., a number that has grown from 1 in 10,000 in the 1980s to 1 in 68 today. For many autism parents, the CDC being in charge of both implementing the vaccine schedule and monitoring the safety of vaccines has always felt like an extreme conflict of interest. And, we were never alone in that feeling. 10 years ago, two members of Congress, Representatives Dave Weldon and Carolyn Maloney, tried to pass a bill to separate vaccine safety from the CDC: From the press release for the bill: Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney At a press conference Wednesday morning, U.S. Reps. Dave Weldon, M.D. (R-FL) and Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) introduced a bill that would give responsibility for the nations vaccine safety to an independent agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, removing most vaccine safety research from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Currently, the CDC has responsibility for both vaccine safety and promotion, which is an inherent conflict of interest increasingly garnering public criticism. Congressman Dave Weldon, M.D. Theres an enormous inherent conflict of interest within the CDC and if we fail to move vaccine safety to a separate independent office, safety issues will remain a low priority and public confidence in vaccines will continue to erode, said Weldon, noting that across the federal government similar conflicts of interests have been remedied, but with regard to mandatory childhood vaccines the conflict continues to persist unchecked. This bill will provide the independence necessary to ensure that vaccine safety research is robust, unbiased, and broadly accepted by the public at large. Vaccines do wonders for public health, but when the government requires them, it must also ensure that theyre safe, said Maloney. We need adequate, unbiased research on vaccines, and this legislation would deliver that. I applaud Dr. Weldon for his tremendous commitment to and leadership on this issue. He is truly dedicated to protecting our children and the public at large. See: https://maloney.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/weldon-maloney-introduce-vaccine-safety-bill Alas, like every bill intended to reduce the power and influence of the CDC, the bill never passed. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., a well-known environmental activist and progeny of one of the most famous political families in the world, has spoken with force about the conflict problems at CDC: Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. The CDC is a captive agency. The vaccine agency has become a subsidiary of big pharma. Vaccines are a $30 billion industry, an increasing profit center. They have been able to compromise all checks and balances that once protected children.  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. For parents uncertain as to where CDCs loyalties lie, the departure of the previous head of CDC  Julie Gerberding  to a well-paying job as President of the vaccine division of Merck , the largest vaccine maker in the world, made many of us permanently cynical: Dr. Julie Gerberding, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was named president of Merck & Co Incs vaccine division, the company said on Monday. Gerberding, who led the CDC from 2002 to 2009, stepped down when President Barack Obama took office. See: http://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-gerberding-idUSTRE5BK2K520091221 7 Reasons Back to the employees crying in the hallways and eating bagels to feel better. In my opinion, its going to get far worse before it gets better for the CDC, and heres 7 reasons why: Reason #1: The CDC just got outed last month by its own scientists complaining that CDCs mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests. From the Huffington Post on October 17, 2016: Concerns about the inner workings of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been mounting in recent months amid disclosures of cozy corporate alliances. Now a group of more than a dozen senior scientists have reportedly lodged an ethics complaint alleging the federal agency is being influenced by corporate and political interests in ways that short-change taxpayers  It appears that our mission is being influenced and shaped by outside parties and rogue interests  and Congressional intent for our agency is being circumvented by some of our leaders. What concerns us most, is that it is becoming the norm and not the rare exception, the letter states. These questionable and unethical practices threaten to undermine our credibility and reputation as a trusted leader in public health. See: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carey-gillam/spider-bites-cdc-ethics-c b 12525012.html The scientists  who chose to remain anonymous for fear of retribution (never a good reflection on an agencys culture)  published a complete letter with their complaints that you can read here : We are often directed to do things we know are not right.  CDC Scientists Preserving Integrity, Diligence and Ethics in Research (CDC SPIDER) Reason #2: CDC has a whistleblower scientist Dr. William Thompson  alleging that CDC scientists destroyed data that showed a link between the MMR vaccine and autism This is a serious allegation, especially because Dr. Thompson is the principal author of a number of the studies used to prove vaccines dont cause autism released by CDC. From former CBS journalist Sharyl Attkisson: A current Centers for Disease Control (CDC) senior scientist has made an unprecedented admission: he and his colleagueshe says committed scientific misconduct to cover up a meaningful link between vaccines and autism in black boys. Just as startling, the CDC scientist, Dr. William Thompson, says the study co-authors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the study. The remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room, and reviewed and went through all the hardcopy documents that we had thought we should discard, and put them into a huge garbage can. The co-authors brought a big garbage can into the meeting room  [and put the documents] into a huge garbage can.  CDC Senior Scientist Dr. William Thompson See: https://sharylattkisson.com/cdc-scientist-we-scheduled-meeting-to-destroy-vaccine-autism-study-documents/ A huge garbage can? Did he really say that? Yes, he really did, and one of our Congressmen  Representative Bill Posey of Florida  repeated Dr. Thompsons words in Congressional testimony: Reason #3: CDC has another whistleblower alleging that CDCs gathering of autism prevalence numbers has been fraudulent From the The Alliance for Human Research Protection website: On April 4, 2016, Dr. Judith Pinborough-Zimmerman, the former Principal Investigator for the CDCs Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network (ADDM) in Utah, filed a whistleblower lawsuit in the U.S. District Court. Dr. Zimmerman charged University of Utah researchers for CDCs Network with publishing data under peoples names who had not done the work and that the data contained uncorrected errors. Depositions from Zimmerman and her former colleagues suggest that the alleged data errors were serious and have the potential to produce major differences in reported Utah autism rates. In the 2008 ADDM Network Report, Utah autism rates were the highest in the country at 1 in 47. In the 2012 report released today, Utah rates plummeted nearly 20% to 1 in 58 as most other ADDM Network sites reported either rising or stable autism rates. See: http://ahrp.org/lawsuit-by-principal-investigator-for-cdc-utah-autism-data-filed-whistleblower-lawsuit/ Health Choice, an advocacy organization, explains why Ms. Zimmermans allegations are so serious: The CDC has been misrepresenting the alarming rise in autism rates since the late 1980s, says Health Choice Executive Leadership Team Chairman Mark Blaxill. His Health Choice analysis, The Autism Emergency Continues, released today outlines a number of criticisms of the CDCs surveillance program. They have selected a partial and unrepresentative sample of states to track, changed the sample in a biased fashion over the years, and then take too long to report out the data. Todays 2012 report is over a decade behind the problem, giving us autism rates for children born twelve years ago. If the sharp increases in autism rates began in the late 1980s, asks Blaxill, why would CDC design a tracking survey beginning with the 1992 birth year? Elsewhere, theyve published data with very low rates from the late 1980s in New Jersey and Georgia but dont connect the dots in the ADDM publications from todays 1 in 68 rate back to these earlier numbers. Health Choice is very worried that the CDCs ADDM Network reporting is not accurately representing the seriousness of the autism epidemic. For most affected individuals, autism is a lifelong disability, a condition that frequently wreaks havoc on families, school systems, and state resources. Mr. Blaxill went on to say, since 1990, autism rates have exploded: something new and terrible is happening to a generation of children. Its time to for the CDC stop sugar coating the inconvenient facts and confess that we have a national emergency so we can finally get to the bottom of this tragic problem. Reason #3A: One of the authors of the Danish Studies exonerating thimerosals (a mercury preservative) role in Autism is wanted by the CDC for embezzlement (Authors note: the failure to mention Poul Thorsen was brought up to me by an attentive reader. Its hard to keep track of so much malfeasance!) Im just glad I can prove this one with other articles, its almost too much to believe: Researcher who dispelled vaccine-autism link: Most-wanted fugitive This is on the HHS website, right now! A former Centers for Disease Control (CDC) researcher, best known for his frequently-cited studies dispelling a link between vaccines and autism, is still considered on the lam after allegedly using CDC grants of tax dollars to buy a house and cars for himself. Most wanted fugitive CDC researcher Poul Thorsen published studies dispelling a link between vaccines and autism Poul Thorsen, listed as a most-wanted fugitive by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, was discredited in April 2011 when he was indicted on 13 counts of wire fraud and nine counts of money laundering. Some have argued that his alleged fraudulent behavior calls into question the validity of his studies. There is no indication the studies have been retracted to date. See: https://sharylattkisson.com/researcher-who-dispelled-vaccine-autism-link-most-wanted-fugitive/ I cant make this stuff up! Heres another article about Poul Thorsen from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr: Central Figure in CDC Vaccine Cover-Up Absconds With $2M See: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr/central-figure-in-cdc-vac b 494303.html Reason #4: Two Merck whistleblowers are alleging that the Mumps vaccine doesnt work very well, and that Merck knew that and fudged the data Remember the former CDC head (Julie Gerberding) who went to go work at the Merck vaccine division? Yup, it really is that ugly  See: http://philadelphia.legalexaminer.com/fda-prescription-drugs/massive-fraud-in-merck-mmr-vaccine-testing/ A U.S. judge rejected Mercks attempt at a dismissal after determining there was plausible grounds for the claims. Therefore the medical giant is being forced to defend themselves and their vaccine in at least two federal cases. Merck could also be forced to defend itself in Congress. Representative Bill Posey (R-FL)  a known critic of the CDC whom is investigating the link between autism and vaccines  is reviewing hundreds of documents turned over by the CDC whistleblower. According to the whistleblowers court documents, Mercks misconduct was far-ranging: It failed to disclose that its mumps vaccine was not as effective as Merck represented, (ii) used improper testing techniques, (iii) manipulated testing methodology, (iv) abandoned undesirable test results, (v) falsified test data, (vi) failed to adequately investigate and report the diminished efficacy of its mumps vaccine, (vii) falsely verified that each manufacturing lot of mumps vaccine would be as effective as identified in the labeling, (viii) falsely certified the accuracy of applications filed with the FDA, (ix) falsely certified compliance with the terms of the CDC purchase contract, (x) engaged in the fraud and concealment describe herein for the purpose of illegally monopolizing the U.S. market for mumps vaccine, (xi) mislabeled, misbranded, and falsely certified its mumps vaccine, and (xii) engaged in the other acts described herein to conceal the diminished efficacy of the vaccine the government was purchasing. The fraudulent activities, say the whistleblowers, were designed to produce test results that would meet the FDAs requirement that the mumps vaccine was 95 percent effective. Reason #5: Just yesterday, a local Atlanta TV station explained to the world what the vaccine court is and that its not working Definitive book on the vaccine court. Never heard of the Vaccine Court? Youre not alone. This is the first news story Ive ever seen mentioning and criticizing the court, and its from an Atlanta TV station! From WSB-TV: A federal program designed to help victims suffering from life-altering reactions to vaccines is falling short on promises made when it started. Its called the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, a $3.6 billion fund created to take care of victims with catastrophic reactions to vaccines. But a Channel 2 Action News investigation found it also protects vaccine-makers from being subject to lawsuits. And they dont pay for the program  you do. See: http://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/investigates/3b-program-to-help-vaccine-victims-falls-short-on-promises/467245775 Reason #6: A published study shows that 83 cases from vaccine court (see above) compensated children with autism for vaccine injury So, let me get this straight: A senior scientist from the CDC who authored many of the studies proving vaccines dont cause autism says they threw away data in a big garbage can that showed a connection between vaccines and autism  A group of lawyers then reviewed records from the vaccine court and found children with autism are being compensated by the court for vaccine injury causing their autism   Are we sure vaccines cant cause autism? Read: Pace Environmental Law Review For over 20 years, the federal government has publicly denied a vaccine-autism link, while at the same time its Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has been awarding damages for vaccine injury to children with brain damage, seizures and autism. A new investigation, based on verifiable government data, breaks ground in the controversial vaccine-autism debate. The investigation found that a substantial number of children compensated for vaccine injury also have autism and that such cases have existed since 1989, the year after the VICP was formed. SafeMinds Executive Director, Lyn Redwood, RN, MSN comments, This study dramatically shifts the debate on autism and vaccines. The question is no longer, Can vaccines cause autism? The answer is clear. Now, we have to ask, How many cases of autism have vaccines caused and how do we prevent new injuries from occurring? The government has asserted that it does not track autism among the vaccine-injured. SafeMinds responds that not looking is the easiest way not to find something. SafeMinds is calling for immediate federal research into the mechanisms of injury in these children in an effort to protect other children from harm and Congressional action to reform the VICP. Reason #7: President-Elect Trump appears to know the truth about vaccines and autism, and hes not afraid to say it! Yes, I saved the best for last. If youre an autism parent, you already knew this one. But, Donald Trump has been speaking the truth about what happened to our kids for years. The first I heard of President-elect Trumps understanding of this issue was back in December 2007: TRUMP SPEAKS: I THINK ITS THE VACCINATIONS See: http://www.ageofautism.com/2007/12/trump-speaks1.html What if you were a large national autism charity and you held a fundraiser at a billionaires house and the billionaire told reporters he thought autism was caused by vaccines? What if your large national autism charity was wildly dismissive of vaccines as a cause for autism, had scientists on staff who had worked to produce faulty research exonerating vaccines alongside the CDC, and had no research dollars allocated to exploring the vaccine-autism relationship? Well, then you would be Autism Speaks holding a fundraiser at Donald Trumps Palm Beach mansion. As THIS article from the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports: At a news conference Thursday in a gold-trimmed Mar-A-Lago ballroom, Trumps wife, Melania, noted her 22-month-old son, Baron, and said: I cannot imagine what the mothers [with autistic children] and mothers all around the world go through.   Lets get rid of autism. In an interview, Donald Trump said he thinks the rising prevalence of autism is related to vaccinations of babies and toddlers. One in 150 children is now diagnosed with autism, with the prevalence higher among boys. When I was growing up, autism wasnt really a factor, he [Trump] said. And now all of a sudden, its an epidemic. Everybody has their theory, and my theory is the shots. Theyre getting these massive injections at one time. I think its the vaccinations . As you may know, President-elect Trumps statements have only gotten bolder since then. Or how about his words during this appearance on Fox News? Thank you for your honesty, President-elect Trump. Crying through the hallways at CDC? I think the crying has just begun. J.B. Handley is the father of a child with Autism. He and his wife co-founded Generation Rescue, Jenny McCarthys autism charity.

In a series of tweets and ... http:///2016/11/cdc-scientist-confirms-donald-trump-is.html Donald Trump is no stranger to controversy, including the vaccine debate. In a series of tweets and interviews over the past few years, the presidential candidate has stated that he strongly believes that there is a link between "monstrous" vaccines and autism . He has suggested that delivering vaccines in smaller doses over time could reduce autism rates among U.S. children. Despite being cast to the lunatic fringe by the mainstream media for his remarks, CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson has confirmed Trump's suspicions  namely, that   autism is real .Congressman Bill Posey from Florida helped expose the corruption of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) . He recently read a statement on the House floor written by CDC scientist Dr. William Thompson.In the statement, Dr. Thompson admitted to omitting data from a study which showed that autism rates were higher among African American boys who received the MMR vaccination before the age of three.(1) "Regardless of the subject matter, parents making decisions about their children's health deserve to have the best information available to them. "They should be able to count on federal agencies to tell them the truth. For these reasons, I bring the following matter to the House floor," Posey stated.(2) He then proceeded to read the statement provided by Dr. Thompson. The statement pertained to a 2004 study published in the journal Pediatrics. The doctor revealed that he and his colleagues intentionally destroyed data in the study which showed that African American MMR-vaccinated boys under the age of three had   for autism. According to the whistleblower, the CDC held a meeting of scientists to discuss whether they should destroy the evidence. The authors decided to scrap their findings. Fortunately, Dr. Thompson saved computer files and hard copies of the omitted data for legal reasons.(3) "Mr. Speaker, I believe it is our duty to insure that the documents that Dr. Thompson are not ignored. Therefore I will provide them to members of Congress and the House Committees upon request. "Considering the nature of the whistleblower's documents as well as the involvement of the CDC, a hearing and a thorough investigation is warranted," Posey concluded.(2) Because the report pertains to vaccines, the mainstream media continues to ignore these revelations. Meanwhile, they continue to parade Donald Trump as a kook for suggesting that there is a link   The double standard boggles the mind and sickens the stomach.Trump hasn't backed down from the vaccine debate despite the mainstream media's backlash against his remarks. In 2015, he appeared on the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham's show stating: "I've known people that had totally magnificent children, functioning a hundred percent, everything beautiful, smart as a whip, and they go for this shot and get this shot of this massive dose, of everything at one time, and they end up with horrible autism."(4) In addition, Trump stated on a Fox News television program in 2012: "I've seen people where they have a perfectly healthy child, and they go for the vaccinations and a month later the child is no longer healthy."(5) Trump made similar remarks in a series of tweets in 2014, after a CDC report revealed that autism rates in U.S. children had increased by 30 percent in the last two years.(6)The CDC report that coincided with Trump's tweets did not actually state what caused the spike in autism rates. Given Dr. Thompson's recent testimony, however, it's easy to think of at least one possibility. By S. Johnson

Print Email http:///2016/11/donald-trump-promised-to-bring-edward.html Edward Snowden is an American computer professional who previously worked as a contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA). Snowden made headlines around the world in 2013, after he copied and leaked classified information from the NSA, belonging to the United States government. His disclosures revealed how the American government had covertly spied on its citizens  and the rest of the world  in the name of so-called national security. These damning revelations exposed the American government, even among its allies. The Department of Justice later unsealed charges against Snowden, forcing him to seek asylum in Russia.Currently, Snowden is living at an undisclosed location in the vast country and has, so far, spent three years in exile. Since the disclosures, privacy activists in the West have pushed for more anti-spying laws. In the United States, for example, Congress has ordered the NSA to end its bulk phone metadata collection program authorized by a particular portion  Section 215  of the Patriot Act. Under the new guidelines from Congress, the NSA may no longer directly collect and hold data about the domestic phone records of American citizens. In 2013, when Snowden made these revelations, the American public, and even people elsewhere in other countries, shared their opinion on the matter. Where some people, especially those in the Obama administration, believed Snowden should be crucified, privacy activists saw Snowden as a hero. At that time, Trump, of course, was preparing to run for the office of president of the United States. He also shared his opinion on the revelations made by Snowden, which had rocked the country to its core. The billionaire said then, that he would bring Snowden back to the United States with an apology, if only he was the president of the country. Below is Trumps Tweet on the matter on June 18, 2013. All I can say is that if I were President, Snowden would have already been returned to the U.S. (by their fastest jet) and with an apology!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2013 When Trump tweeted, many mocked him, saying that he would never become the president of the United States. However, now that he has just been elected, some people are holding him to his words, demanding that he immediately bring Snowden back, as he once said. In another tweet, published on April 19, 2016, Trump said Snowden deserves nothing but the death penalty for damaging the countrys reputation with his revelations. Snowden also responded by saying he does not fear death, and that he has done nothing wrong, but only provided help to the people around the world. Before the elections, Trump was accused by Democrats  and even some Republicans  of having ties to the Russian government. Hillary Clinton alleged that the Kremlin, led by President Vladimir Putin, was trying to rig the election in favor of Trump. The concern here is that if it is true, that Trump indeed has links with the Russians, then he might possibly negotiate for the return of Snowden. Of course, Trump cannot order for the execution of Snowden, but he can certainly put him in jail. Snowden himself seems to have preferred Trump over Clinton, during the election. He tweeted before the election that the election was between Trump and Goldman Sachs, referring Goldman Sachs to Clinton. 2016: a choice between Donald Trump and Goldman Sachs.  Edward Snowden (@Snowden) February 28, 2016 For activists, Trump can turn things around by pardoning Snowden . Apart from Snowden, there are also calls for Trump to intervene and free Chelsea Manning and Julian Assange. WikiLeaks has said President Obama has a politically pivitol moment to pardon Manning and Snowden, and if not, he hands Trump a presidency with the freedom to take his prize. Assange and his WikiLeaks organization have come under heavy scrutiny from the Democratic Party for helping Trump to win the election. WikiLeaks published many hacked emails of the party, revealing corruption and malpractices in favor of Clinton getting the nomination of the party. This unhinged the unity of the party, and may have contributed to the voters choice of the presidential candidates.

 Billionaire globalist financier George Soros MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force beh... Print Email http:///2016/11/billionaire-globalist-soros-exposed-as.html Billionaire globalist financier George Soros MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation  and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. Wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle, and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today. In light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether its an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous. Soros affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: "Americans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results"Hundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia."Tonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesdays presidential election."The gatherings  organized by MoveOn.org and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trumps bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible."Within two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon." Now come reports from various protest locations that reveal a substantially coordinated effort, and not the organic grassroots showing by concerned Americans, as the mainstream media is reporting. Photos from Austin, Texas reveal a line of busses the protestors arrived in, making their appearance seem substantially less than organic  with a direct implication of being strategically orchestrated. Anti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem. Here are the busses they came in. #fakeprotests #trump2016 #austin pic.twitter.com/VxhP7t6OUI  erictucker (@erictucker) November 10, 2016 With evidence mounting, the question must be asked; is George Soros working through his front organizations to foment an American revolution? @BeshoyBadie @desjax @erictucker Pretty evident that the signs were printed by Soros and Creamer groups. IIRC Soros linked w/ MB & Huma pic.twitter.com/KgXvIQr2b8  MEGATRON (@MEGATRONs SMIRK) November 10, 2016 Note that the group is actively organizing protests to a democratic election that no one is contesting the legitimacy of in terms of whether the vote was rigged, etc. Essentially, they are displeased with the results and are calling for people to rise up and not accept the results. For an organization that feigns to promote democracy, their actions speak otherwise. This is a disaster. We fought our hearts out to avert this reality. But now its here, MoveOn.org staff wrote to members on Wednesday. The new president-elect and many of his most prominent supporters have targeted, demeaned, and threatened millions of usand millions of our friends, family, and loved ones. Both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands. We are entering an era of profound and unprecedented challenge, a time of danger for our communities and our country. In this moment, we have to take care of ourselves, our families, and our friendsespecially those of us who are on the front lines facing hate, including Latinos, women, immigrants, refugees, Black people, Muslims, LGBT Americans, and so many others. And we need to make it clear that we will continue to stand together. Perhaps the most absurd part of the protests is that President-elect Trump hasnt made a single policy decision yet  and, in fact, the entire section of his website regarding banning Muslims was scrubbed shortly after his election. This denotes that anything said during the campaign was most likely simple election campaign rhetoric and subsequent framing of said rhetoric by the opposition. The left wing organization is one of a number of progressive organizations affiliated with Soros Open Society Foundation. Soros-affiliated organizations across the world are deeply connected to various color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and a number of other political uprisings across the globe. According to a report in New Eastern Outlook : "The totality of what is revealed in the three hacked documents show that Soros is effectively the puppet-master pulling most of the strings in Kiev. Soros Foundations Ukraine branch, International Renaissance Foundation (IRF) has been involved in Ukraine since 1989. "His IRF doled out more than $100 million to Ukrainian NGOs two years before the fall of the Soviet Union, creating the preconditions for Ukraines independence from Russia in 1991. Soros also admitted to financing the 2013-2014 Maidan Square protests that brought the current government into power."Soros foundations were also deeply involved in the 2004 Orange Revolution that brought the corrupt but pro-NATO Viktor Yushchenko into power with his American wife who had been in the US State Department. "In 2004 just weeks after Soros International Renaissance Foundation had succeeded in getting Viktor Yushchenko as President of Ukraine, Michael McFaul wrote an OpEd for the Washington Post. McFaul, a specialist in organizing color revolutions, who later became US Ambassador to Russia, revealed:"Did Americans meddle in the internal affairs of Ukraine? Yes. The American agents of influence would prefer different language to describe their activities  democratic assistance, democracy promotion, civil society support, etc.  but their work, however labeled, seeks to influence political change in Ukraine." Anyone familiar with the history of the Soros Open Society Foundations in Eastern Europe and around the world since the late 1980s, will know that his supposedly philanthropic democracy-building projects in Poland, Russia, or Ukraine in the 1990s allowed Soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries wealth, according to the New Eastern Outlook. During the 2016 presidential cycle, Soros committed $25 million dollars to the 2016 campaign of Hillary Clinton. Per the standard Clinton operating procedure, this was indicative of the symbiotic relationship of favors between the billionaire and his array of political puppets across the globe. As a testament to the power wielded by Soros, contained within WikiLeaks recent release of hacked DNC emails, is a message from billionaire globalist financier George Soros to Hillary Clinton while she was U.S. Secretary of State, that clearly reveals Clinton as a Soros puppet. Found within the WikiLeaks Hillary Clinton email archive is an email with the subject  Unrest in Albania , in which Soros makes clear to Clinton that  two things need to be done urgently . The Clinton-Podesta Email Scandal is All About SATANISM and Pedophilia: 'Sacrificing a Chicken to Moloch' He then directs the Secretary of State to  bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha  and  appoint a senior European official as mediator . Revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power, Soros then provides Secretary of State Clinton with three names from which to choose. Unsurprisingly, Clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by Soros  Miroslav Lajcak. Make no mistake that the events youre seeing transpire nationwide are being orchestrated in part by a billionaire political elite class that is looking to subvert the will of the American people by attempting to foment a new American revolution. Soros formula has been duplicated in numerous nations, and it looks as if he now has the U.S. in his sights as the next target. Please share this critically import story in hope of waking people up to the globalist agenda at work here in America!

http:///2016/11/john-mccain-to-donald-trump-dont-you.html Sit down. This is going to shock you. (Not). We reported yesterday on the telephone call between US president-elect Trump and Russian president Putin, where the current and future presidents discussed the need to set aside differences and look to more constructive future relations. With serious observers of this past year's increasing tensions between US and Russia openly worrying about a nuclear war breaking out, with some 300,000 NATO troops placed on Russia's border, with sanctions hurting average businesspersons on both sides, a normal person might look at the slight thaw in Cold War 2.0 as an early positive indicator of the end of the Obama Era.Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) begs to differ.In a blistering statement he released today responding to the Trump/Putin telephone call, Sen. McCain condemned any efforts by President-elect Trump to find common ground with Putin. Any claim by Putin that he wants to improve relations with the US must be vigorously opposed, writes McCain. He explains: "We should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened Americas allies, and attempted to undermine Americas elections." Interesting that Republican McCain has taken to using the Hillary Clinton campaign line (the one that lost her the election) that somehow the Russians were manipulating the US electoral process. The claim was never backed up by facts and Hillary's claim that some 17 US intelligence agencies agreed with her was shown to be a dangerous and foolish lie.Why is Putin not to be trusted, according to McCain? "Vladimir Putin has rejoined Bashar Assad in his barbaric war against the Syrian people with the resumption of large-scale Russian air and missile strikes in Idlib and Homs. Another brutal assault on the city of Aleppo could soon follow." What McCain doesn't say is that unlike US troops in Syria, the Russians are invited by the Syrian government and operate according to international law . Oh yes, and they are also fighting al-Qaeda and ISIS , which has sought to overthrow Assad for the past five years. Maybe McCain is just really sensitive after meeting with al-Qaeda and ISIS in Syria? As rumors swirl from Washington about neocons sniffing out top jobs in the incoming administration, it would serve president-elect Trump well to reflect on he true nature of the neocon beast...

 President Elect Trump is new title for New York businessman, millionaire and Republican candidate Do... Print Email http:///2016/11/president-elect-trump-new-era-of.html President Elect Trump is new title for New York businessman, millionaire and Republican candidate Donald J. Trump, who yesterday on November 8th, 2016 successfully won the US presidential election. Trump managed to defeat favorite Hillary Clinton by a relatively narrow margin. The victory came as a shock to many Americans, regardless of where they reside on the political spectrum. For many in the alternative media, the victory of President Elect Trump comes with a great sense of relief that career criminal Hillary Clinton was not elected (or installed) as so many had expected. Clinton had already showed a propensity to collude, cheat and lie during the Democratic Primaries where she triumphed with dirty tactics over Bernie Sanders.For many others, turned off by Trumps racism, sexism, xenophobia, Islamophobia and generally flippant comments, the Trump victory is devastating and will challenge them psychologically and emotionally to accept the reality for the results. Hillary Clinton: What Went Wrong? The result is especially surprising given the degree to which Hillary Clinton had ingratiated herself with the upper echelons of the NWO ( New World Order ). From an outside perspective, it seemed Clinton had left no stone unturned in brown-nosing and sucking up to the most powerful people and organizations in the world, including the Rothschilds , Goldman Sachs, the Rockefeller CFR ( Council on Foreign Relations ) and many many more. Additionally, given her propensity for criminality and her powerful backers such as George Soros , coupled with the serious problems electronic voting machines possess in being able to be hacked and the vote flipped, many are left wondering how Hillary lost . What went wrong? At this stage in the game of post-election analysis, we can point to a few things. Hillarys criminal past clearly caught up with her. It is unprecedented in the history of US presidential elections for a leading candidate to be under an on-again, off-again criminal investigation. Clinton simply has so many scandals in her recent and distant past that its like trying to stop a ship with 30 holes from sinking; you cant plug them all. She was also running up against the problem that the Democrats had been in power for 8 years, when recent history shows that power seems to change hands in around that time frame. Clinton represented the establishment, and as the popularity of both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump has shown, people are tired of the same. They intuitively know the system is rigged and corrupt, even if they cant exactly put their fingers on it. Obama, Mr. Hope and Change, got in with a slick campaign of promising something different (upon which he didnt deliver). Trump represented anti-establishment, and whether he truly embodies that or not is an entirely different matter, because its all about perception. Does a Trump Victory Show that NWO Powerbrokers Are Less in Control than It Seems? The win of President Elect Trump is truly shocking and monumental event. Many people (including myself) were predicting that it was a foregone conclusion that Clinton would win. For instance, founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange stated before the election that Trump would not permitted to win. The MSM ( Mainstream Media ) were clearly favoring Clinton at almost every turn. Whatever you think of Trump, we can at least say the will of the majority of American voters was respected, which is a relief, given how much corruption exists in our society today.The question now is this: is a Trump victory the result the NWO powerbrokers wanted all along, for reasons we are yet to see? Or is it a genuine uprising against these forces? What Does a Trump Presidency Mean for Liberty and Freedom? For me, Trump can be summarized in one word: unpredictable . President Elect Trump truly embodies unpredictability more than any other high-level politician around. One moment he is railing against the 9/11 official story, then he is declaring his love for Israel, then he is bringing up the vaccine-autism connection, then he is suggesting Snowden be killed. Next he is suggesting GMO corn makes you stupid, then he suggesting Muslims be banned from the US, then he is calling global warming a hoax , then he is suggesting the Government be given the power to shut down the internet. Then, after all of that, he makes friendly overtures to Russia while demonizing the hell out of Iran. What does he stand for? Peace or war? Freedom or tyranny?At this stage no one knows, probably not even Trump himself. He has contradicted himself numerous times throughout his campaign, and merely once suggesting a good idea (i.e. looking at who controls the issuance of money instead of letting the international bankers via the Federal Reserve control it) doesnt mean it will become his policy. Unpredictability is one of Trumps great qualities, but also one of his most dangerous. A lot will depend on with whom he surrounds himself once becoming President Trump, and what kind of advice they give him. His VP Mike Pence is a standard conservative Republican who will be no doubt far more to the liking of the NWO conspirators, but Trump is also taking advice from retired DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) chief Michael Flynn, the man who came out and highlighted how the US created ISIS in a declassified DIA document .For now, America and the world have around two-and-a-half months to get over the incredible shock of yesterdays result and psychologically prepare itself for a Trump presidency. Meanwhile, it would be foolish for us to expect that one man can fix all of Americas problems. It will be the job of the independent and alternative media to hold Trump to his promises and his word, and to continue to share ideas of how we can truly create a better, freer and more just society. This necessarily involves questioning the very structures and systems of society, and will never magically improve with just the passing of the baton from one politician to another.

Print Email http:///2016/11/president-trump-man-made-global-warming.html Man-made global warming is a hoax perpetuated by the elite to make money and damage the U.S. economy, according to President-elect Donald Trump  and America isnt going to stand for it anymore. Obama thinks its the number one problem in the world today. I think its very low on the list, Trump said on the Hugh Hewitt show, indicating a major shift in U.S. policy. Trump continued: You know in the 1920s people talked about global cooling, they thought the earth was cooling. I believe there is weather and I believe there is change and I believe it goes up and it goes down and it goes up again and it changes depending on years and centuries. Pointing out that U.S. manufacturing and the economy as a whole has suffered since climate change rules were introduced by global organizations  making everybody poorer, except the elites who profit from the fearmongering  Trump has promised to make America competitive again.Trump is putting his money where his mouth is. According to a member of his transition team, the President-elect is looking at ways to withdraw as quickly as possible from a costly global climate agreement currently being ratified in Morocco. Since Trumps victory in Tuesdays election, governments ranging from China to small island states have reaffirmed their support for the agreement at climate talks running until November 18 in Marrakesh, Morocco. But Trump believes the global rules and regulations will continue to harm the American economy and the President-elect wants out. It was reckless for the Paris Agreement to enter into force before the election, the source, who works on Trumps transition team, told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Top Scientist Resigns: ' Global Warming is a $Trillions Scam  It has Corrupted Many Scientists ' 30,000 scientists agree with Trump A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward agreeing with Trump that man-made climate change is a scam perpetuated by the global elite in order to make money. One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore . The weather has been so cold for so long that the global warming HOAXSTERS were forced to change the name to climate change to keep $ flow!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2014 If youre still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his climate change crusade, flying around the world on his private jet, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $200 million in 2016  largely due to investments in fake green tech companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans. From the National Review : A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased. Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda  even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being pushed by global warming proponents. And, of course, there are the more than 30,000 American scientists (to date) who agree with Trump and have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative  and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. Breaking: Global Warming Data FAKED by Government Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth  not human activity . Many more still are likely to sign the petition and speak out against the mainstream propaganda now that Trump has indicated a major change in U.S. policy. By Baxter Dmitry
A short summation of this election cycle would read more like a spy novel than it would a typical race. Theres been Russian intrigue, neo-Nazi violence, backstabbing, double-dealing, conspiracies, hidden foreign connections, and even a full-on James Bond-like supervillain. The world seems to have flipped upside-down, making former friends enemies and former enemies friends. And the latest case of that is Foxs Jeanine Pirro, who early on Sunday, took to the airwaves to side with Hillary Clinton in being critical of FBI director James Comeys announcement of new emails last week . Yes, a Fox News anchor sided with Clinton. Maybe the Mayans were right about this whole end of the world stuff, but they forgot to carry a zero and were a couple of years off. All that is wrong with Washington There are so many non-scandals concerning email swirling around Clinton that it can be difficult to keep them separate, and they tend to blur together in a big ball of nonsense  unless youre a right-winger, in which case you probably have a detailed ledger of all the scandals and update that ledger daily. The latest scandal comes from FBI director James Comey, who, last week, revealed that the FBI had found additional emails they were investigating. Comey, in his infinite good sense, announced this publically, less than two weeks before the election, because nobody would assume that was good old-fashioned Nixonian ratfucking. Except thats exactly what happened, and thats not just my read on the situation  its also Judge Jeanine Pirros read on it, too. While speaking early Sunday morning, Pirro ripped into Comey, denouncing him as symptomatic of all that is wrong with Washington. Pirro continued : One of the most revered agencies in our nations historynow seen as putting its finger on the scales of justiceshould not now be front and center. You know I support Donald Trump and want him to win, but whether its Hillary Clinton or anyone else, Comeys actions violate not only longstanding Justice Department policy but the most fundamental rules of fairness and impartiality. Comey, it should be noted, made his announcement without the backing of the Department of Justice . The most generous reading about this is that Comey made a short-sighted mistake and needs to be reprimanded. The most cynical reading is that Comey chose his timing so he could try to torpedo Clintons campaign. Comeys announcement confused aids and prosecutors , too, with some wondering why he would drop a bombshell which could be a big dud and others accusing him of acting irresponsibly. Pirro explained she had something like this happen to her; she ran for New York attorney general about 10 years ago, and when she was in the homestretch, the Justice Department and the FBI broke the policy prohibiting public statements that affect elections and said they were going to open an investigation of Pirro. Pirro called it mean-spirited and noted that it was bootless, with the only direct result being it cost her at the polls. At any rate, theres an old saying about stopped clocks on military time thats relevant here.

Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr Just one week before America decides whether or not to elect Donald Trump, one of his supporters decided to help get his message out by torching a black church and defacing its wall with the words Vote Trump. When firefighters arrived at Hopewell Missionary Baptist Church Tuesday night, they found it in flames, and the Vote Trump slogan written in silver spray paint on the outside wall of the church, Mark Rigsby of Mississippi Public Broadcasting reports. Greenville Mayor Errick Simmons calls this a hate crime  an attempt to frighten voters just days before the presidential election. Trump has yet to condemn the attack, or even mention it. Mississippi has been the host of many decades of violence directed at African Americans. During the Jim Crow era, acts of terror committed against black Mississippians was disturbingly common. It seems for at least one Trump supporter, the term Make American Great Again means returning to that dark time. But rather than let this disgusting display of intolerance be the story, Americans got to work. In just hours, a verified GoFundMe account was set up by concerned citizens and thousands of dollars began to pour in to help rebuild. Its goal was to raise $10,000. It likely wouldnt be enough to repair all of the damages inside and outside of the church, but it would be a start. Instead, people gave over $150,000. And perhaps even more remarkably, the entire world appeared ready to reject the deplorable racism and bigotry that led to this act. The campaigns organizer updated the campaign by saying that people from all faiths (and none at all) and many countries have contributed: Responses have been pouring in from all over the world, and theyre truly extraordinary. Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists and many more, from all over the United States and many other countries. And according to GoFundMes VP of Communications and Policy Dan Pfeiffer, this campaign is perhaps the fastest growing in the history of the site. This one right here is verified and one of our fastest growing history https://t.co/E4smWW2s7d https://t.co/xIQWY4ulsV  Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) November 3, 2016 A slogan that has often been used to counter Trumps message of cynical bigotry comes to mind: Love trumps hate.

0 comments Obama was speaking to donors at a private fundraiser in California when he railed against former House Oversight Committee Chair Darrell Issa for calling his administration corrupt. Heres a guy who called my administration perhaps the most corrupt in history  despite the fact that actually we have not had a major scandal in my administration, Obama said! Obama has had more scandals than any president in history! Just because the MSM refuses to report on them does not mean they do not exist! Issa was the key figure in several investigations of the Obama administration, including the Fast and Furious debacle with Attorney General Eric Holder, Hillary Clintons failure in Benghazi, the failures in the Veterans Affairs department, and the IRS using its power to target conservative Tea Party groups for investigations. Obama accused Issa of wasting taxpayer money on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere. This guy has spent all his time simply trying to obstruct, to feed the same sentiments that resulted in Donald Trump becoming their nominee, Obama said. We could list 77 scandals, but here are just 7 of the biggest! 1.) IRS Targeting Scandal In 2013, Lois Lerner, former director of the IRS Exempt Organizations division, admitted that officials in the IRS Cincinnati office acted improperly. 2.) VA Waiting List The Department of Veterans Affairs inspector general first noted the waiting list problem at a Phoenix clinic in 2014 and then found other clinics with similar problems. Veterans were placed on phony waiting lists, and some even died while waiting for care. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned from his position. 3.) GSA Spending Spree In 2012, Martha N. Johnson, the administrator of the General Services Administration, resigned after the federal procurement agency was engulfed in a controversy. The department was accused of allowing excessive spending on travel and conferences for the agency and employees. 4.) Attack on the Benghazi Compound On Sept. 11, 2012, weeks before a presidential election, terrorists attacked U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, Libya. Obama administration officials initially blamed this attack on a spontaneous protest against an anti-Muslim YouTube video that spun out of control. 5.) Clinton Emails It was the Benghazi committee that first discovered that before, during, and after her time as secretary of state, Clinton maintained a private email server. This prompted the FBI to investigate questions of whether Clinton violated the law in terms of storing classified information. 6.) Fast and Furious Gun Walking Operation Fast and Furious was a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives program, meant to be a sting operation. It allowed about 2,000 guns to flow to Mexican drug trafficking organizations under federal supervision before authorities lost control of the guns. 7.) Solyndra Subsidies The Energy Department provided a $535 million loan guarantee to the politically connected solar panel firm Solyndra as part of the 2009 stimulus bill. Not long after building its factory, the California firm filed for bankruptcy protection and an FBI investigation ensued. The company did not find a buyer and eventually closed down. So Barack Obama just shut up!
Ivanka Trumps Instagram account stands apart from her fathers candidacy. Its the public feed of Ivanka, the brand. American wife, mother & entrepreneur. EVP at the Trump Organization. Founder of IvankaTrump.com and #WomenWhoWork, her bio says. Scrolling through, it sometimes feels like an alternate reality. When Donald Trumps presidential campaign is in free fall, or facing controversy, Ivanka is posting a mix of inspirational quotes, family pics, and the occasional selfie. Photos of her on the campaign trail are far and few between. Thats on purpose. My Women Who Work initiative and my brand, was launched far before the presidential cycle commenced and will continue long afterwards, she said this month at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. Still, the Donald Trump campaign and Ivanka Trump brand do coexist, and its often jarring to witness them side-by-side. This is the story of the 2016 campaign, juxtaposed with @ivankatrump. June 16, 2016: Donald Trump announces his presidential campaign at Trump Tower in New York City. Ivanka introduces him as a man who needs no introduction. Actors are paid to wear shirts and pretend to be supporters. Trump accuses Mexico of sending drugs, rapists, and murders across the border and promises to build a wall on the southern border. Ivanka posts a photo of her introduction. See her speech on IvankaTrump.com (link in profile). A photo posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Jun 16, 2015 at 4:55pm PDT December 7, 2015: Donald Trump calls for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States following an ISIS-inspired shooting in San Bernardino. Ivanka posts five black and white photos to promote her Ivanka Trump Jewelry campaign. I love the idea of elevating an otherwise simple look with stunning accessories, she writes. A photo posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Dec 7, 2015 at 10:56am PST February 18, 2016: Donald Trump calls Pope Francis disgraceful after his comment that anyone who wants to build a wall is not Christian. No leader, especially a religious leader, has the right to question another mans religion or faith, Trump says. Ivanka posts a photo with the (Link in profile) to her next #dinner #menu. The #recipes are sure to warm you up when its cold outside! she writes. A photo posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Feb 18, 2016 at 2:15pm PST March 13, 2016: Donald Trump says he will pay the legal fees of a man accused of assaulting a protester at his rally in North Carolina. From what I heard, there was a lot of taunting and a certain finger was placed in the air, he says on Meet The Press. I dont condone what he did. But you know what, not nice for the other side, either. Ivanka posts that she finally saw @HamiltonMusical the previous night and was blown away. Definitely a must-see! she writes, with two thumbs up emoji. A photo posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Mar 13, 2016 at 6:58pm PDT March 30, 2016: Donald Trump defends his then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who the day before was charged with battery after being accused of grabbing then-Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Trump tells Today Fields lied. Ivanka posts an inspirational #WomenWhoWork quote from Dorit Jaffee about tranquility. A photo posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Mar 16, 2016 at 6:37am PDT September 30, 2016: Donald Trump goes on an early morning tweetstorm, attacking Hillary Clinton and Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe contestant Trump once called Miss Piggy and Miss Housekeeping, between 3 a.m. to 5 a.m. He accused Machado of being in a sex tape, which she was not. Ivanka posts a photo of a woman with a card in her purse that reads Women Who Do It All and writes The weekend is calling your name! #WomenWhoWork. A photo posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Sep 30, 2016 at 11:03am PDT October 22, 2016: During a policy speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, Donald Trump threatens to sue the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign, he says. Total fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these lill be sued after the election is over. Ivanka posts a looping video of her feet in front of a toasty fire.

Still, the Donald Trump campaign and Ivanka Trump brand do coexist, and it's often jarring to witness them side-by-side. This is the story of the 2016 campaign, juxtaposed with @ivankatrump. June 16, 2016: Donald Trump announces his presidential campaign at Trump Tower in New York City. Ivanka introduces him as a man who needs no introduction. Actors are paid to wear shirts and pretend to be supporters. Trump accuses Mexico of sending drugs, rapists, and murders across the border and promises to build a wall on the southern border. Ivanka posts a photo of her introduction. See her speech on IvankaTrump.com (link in profile).

From what I heard, there was a lot of taunting and a certain finger was placed in the air, he says on Meet The Press.I don't condone what he did. But you know what, not nice for the other side, either. Ivanka posts that she finally [email protected] the previous night and was blown away. Definitely a must-see! she writes, with two thumbs up emoji.

The Fight Isnt Against ISIS, Its Against Assad A collection of thoughts about American foreign policy By November 09, 2016 " Information Clearing House " - Louis XVI needed a revolution, Napoleon needed two historic military defeats, the Spanish Empire in the New World needed multiple revolutions, the Russian Czar needed a communist revolution, the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires needed World War I, Nazi Germany needed World War II, Imperial Japan needed two atomic bombs, the Portuguese Empire in Africa needed a military coup at home, the Soviet Empire needed Mikhail Gorbachev What will the American Empire need?I dont believe anyone will consciously launch World War III. The situation now is more like the eve of World War I, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. Ever since Gorbachev naively ended the Cold War, the hugely over-armed United States has been actively surrounding Russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, NATO expansion. At the same time, in recent years the demonization of Vladimir Putin has reached war propaganda levels. Russians have every reason to believe that the United States is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. This mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an evil enemy make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up.  Diana Johnstone, author of Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary ClintonIn September 2013 President Obama stood before the United Nations General Assembly and declared, I believe America is exceptional. The following year at the UN, the president classified Russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the Islamic State and the ebola virus. On March 9, 2015 President Barack Obama declared Venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.Vladimir Putin, speaking at the UN in 2015, addressing the United States re its foreign policy: Do you realize what you have done?Since the end of World War 2, the United States has:Attempted to overthrow more than 50 foreign governments, most of which were democratically-elected. Dropped bombs on the people of more than 30 countries. Attempted to assassinate more than 50 foreign leaders. Attempted to suppress a populist or nationalist movement in 20 countries. Grossly interfered in democratic elections in at least 30 countries.* Plus although not easily quantified has been more involved in the practice of torture than any other country in the world for over a century not just performing the actual torture, but teaching it, providing the manuals, and furnishing the equipment. *See chapter 18 of , Rogue State: A Guide to the Worlds Only SuperpowerOn October 28, 2016 Russia was voted off the UN Human Rights Council. At the same time Saudi Arabia won a second term, uncontested. Does anyone know George Orwells email address?A million refugee from Washingtons warfare are currently over-running Europe. Theyre running from Afghanistan and Iraq; from Libya and Somalia; from Syria and Pakistan.Germany is taking in many Syrian refugees because of its World War Two guilt. What will the United States do in the future because of its guilt? But Americans are not raised to feel such guilt.The Plan is for the United States to rule the world. The overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. It calls for the United States to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. It calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. It says not that the United States must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful. Vice-President Dick Cheney  West Point lecture, June 2002Two flew over the cuckoos nest: We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known. security and freedom for millions of people around the globe have depended on Americas military , economic, political, and diplomatic might.  Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney, Why the world needs a powerful America (2015)State Department spokesperson Mark Toner: Assad must go even if Syria goes with him.Many of the moves the Obama administration has made in terms of its Cuba policy are in lockstep with Bill Clintons, as expressed in the recommendations of a 1999 task force report from the Council on Foreign Relations. The report asserted that no change in policy should have the primary effect of consolidating, or appearing to legitimize, the political status quo on the island.A successful American regime change operation in Syria would cut across definite interests of the Russian state. These include the likely use of Syria as a new pipeline route to bring gas from Qatar to the European market, thereby undercutting Gazprom, Russias largest corporation and biggest exporter. Assads refusal to consider such a route played no small role in Qatars pouring billions of dollars in arms and funds into the Syrian civil war on behalf of anti-Assad forces.War with Russia will be nuclear. Washington has prepared for it. Washington has abandoned the ABM treaty, created what it thinks is an ABM shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit US nuclear first strike. All of this is obviously directed at Russia, and the Russian government knows it. How long will Russia sit there waiting for Washingtons first strike?  Paul Craig Roberts, 2014Iran signed the nuclear accords with the United States earlier this year by agreeing to stop what it never was doing. Any Iranian nuclear ambition, real or imagined, is of course a result of American hostility towards Iran, and not the other way around.If the European Union were an independent and rational government it would absolutely forbid any member country from stockpiling American nuclear weapons or hosting a US anti-ballistic missile site or any other military base anywhere close to Russias borders.Full Spectrum Dominance, a term the Pentagon loves to use to refer to total control of the planet: land, sea, air, space, outer space and cyberspace.

I refuse to believe that a little fourth rate power like North Vietnam does not have a breaking point.In 2010, WikiLeaks released a cable sent to US embassies by then- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She wrote this: Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support for Al Qaeda, the Taliban, al Nusra and other terrorist groups worldwide. Surely this resulted in at least Washingtons much-favored weapon: sanctions of various kinds. It did not.US General Barry McCaffrey, April 2015: Because so far NATOs reaction to Putins aggression has been to send a handful of forces to the Baltics to demonstrate resolve, which has only convinced Putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. So we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest Putins stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to protect Russia-speaking people. For Gods sake, the last time we heard that was just before Hitler invaded the Sudetenland. No, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1983 when the United States invaded the tiny nation of Grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of Americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. It was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that that didnt believe that the American Empire was Gods gift to humanity.Since 1980, the United States has intervened in the affairs of fourteen Muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. They are (in chronological order) Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo, Yemen, Pakistan, and now Syria.How our never-ending mideast horror began: Radio Address of George W. Bush, September 28, 2002: The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year. Yet just six weeks before 9/11, Condoleezza Rice told CNN: Lets remember that his [Saddams] country is divided, in effect. He does not control the northern part of his country. We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt.The fact is that there is more participation by the Cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the American population in the running of theirs. One important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the United States, exert great influence over all aspects of life.The U.S. is frantically surrounding China with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines through several nearby smaller Pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in Australia The U.S. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol Chinas nearby waters. Warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon. (Jack A. Smith, Hegemony Games: USA vs. PRC, CounterPunch)Crimea had never voluntarily left Russia. The USSRs leader Nikita Khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia after the US-induced Ukrainian coup in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin refers to the Ukrainian army as NATOs foreign legion, which does not pursue Ukraines national interests. The United States, however, insists on labeling the Russian action in Crimea as an invasion.Putin re Crimea/Ukraine: Our western partners created the Kosovo precedent with their own hands. In a situation absolutely the same as the one in Crimea they recognized Kosovos secession from Serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a countrys central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary And the UN International Court of Justice agreed with those arguments. Thats what they said; thats what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to accept  and now they are complaining about Crimea. Why is that?Paul Craig Roberts: The absurdity of it all! Even a moron knows that if Russia is going to put tanks and troops into Ukraine, Russia will put in enough to do the job. The war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. As Putin himself said some months ago, if the Russian military enters Ukraine, the news will not be the fate of Donetsk or Mauriupol, but the fall of Kiev and Lviv.In a major examination of US policy vis--vis China, published in March 2015, the authoritative Council on Foreign Relations bluntly declared that there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, peaceful coexistence, mutual understanding, a strategic partnership, or a new type of major country relations between the United States and China. The United States, the report declares, must, therefore, develop the political will and military capabilities to deal with China to protect vital U.S. interests.John F. Kennedy changed the mission of the Latin American military from hemispheric defense  an outdated relic of World War II  to internal security, which means war against the domestic population.  Noam ChomskyCuban baseball players who are paid a million dollars to play for an American team are not defectors, a word which has a clear political connotation.Boris Yeltsin was acceptable to American and Europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed Western capital free rein in the newly opened Russian territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsins era was also a time of rampant corruption by Russian oligarchs who were closely associated with Western capital. That corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of Vladimir Putin twice as president between 2000-2008, and again in 2012.Many ISIS leaders were former Iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by American troops.

( Deutsche Welle , April 2, 2014 interview) Wed be even better off if we hadnt overthrown the progressive, secular Afghan government, giving rise to the Taliban in the first place and inciting the Russians to intervene on their border lest the Soviet Islamic population was stirred up.The former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in an interview in 1998 summed up exactly what the US thinks of the UN: The UN plays a very important role.

 Donald Trump claims the U.S. presidential election is rigged, drawing condemnation from the political/media establishment which accuses him of undermining faith in American democracy. But neither side understands the real problem, says .By  " Consortium News " - The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the worlds gold standard that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The wise men of the system simply insist otherwise.We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000).Strangely, in such cases, it is not only the party that benefited which refuses to accept the evidence of wrongdoing, but the losing party and the establishment news media as well. Protecting the perceived integrity of the U.S. democratic process is paramount. Americans must continue to believe in the integrity of the system even when that integrity has been violated.The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nations leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized.Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldnt vote).That unsavory deal enabled Thomas Jefferson to defeat John Adams in the pivotal national election of 1800. In effect, the votes of Southern slave owners like Jefferson counted substantially more than the votes of Northern non-slave owners.Even after the Civil War when the Constitution was amended to give black men voting rights, the reality for black voting, especially in the South, was quite different from the new constitutional mandate. Whites in former Confederate states concocted subterfuges to keep blacks away from the polls to ensure continued white supremacy for almost a century.Women did not gain suffrage until 1920 with the passage of another constitutional amendment, and it took federal legislation in 1965 to clear away legal obstacles that Southern states had created to deny the franchise to blacks.Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedys vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the Souths heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners.However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixons Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960.Nixons TreasonSo, by 1968, the Democrats once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didnt want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that  with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided  President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam.The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixons campaign went behind Johnsons back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnsons Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixons emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam.Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixons treason  from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election  he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford  three pillars of the Establishment  expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking:Some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that Im wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected, Clifford said. It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our countrys interests.Cliffords words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of Americas electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process.To this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixons treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the librarys archivists call the file on Nixons sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their X-file. [For details, see Consortiumnews.coms  LBJs X-File on Nixons Treason. ]The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixons paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his treason  top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJs presidency  led to Nixons creation of the plumbers, a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the plumbers became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committees headquarters at the Watergate in Washington.Although the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixons far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnsons Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixons sabotage  and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome  the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.coms  The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .]In effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixons strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting presidents foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign.Reagans October Surprise CaperIn that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reagans campaign feared that Carter might pull off an October Surprise by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reagans team take action to block Carters October Surprise?The testimonial and documentary evidence that Reagans team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carters October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixons Paris peace talk maneuver.That evidence indicates that Reagans campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reagans vice presidential running mate.By early November 1980, the publics obsession with Irans humiliation of the United States and Carters inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reagans inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan.Bolstered by his image as a tough guy, Reagan enacted much of his right-wing agenda, including passing massive tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, weakening unions and creating the circumstances for the rapid erosion of the Great American Middle Class.Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Irans cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration.In summer 1981, when Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East Nicholas Veliotes learned about the arms shipments to Iran, he checked on their origins and said, later in a PBS interview:It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment. [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time.Those early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reagans beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaraguas leftist government.While many facts of the Iran-Contra scandal were revealed by congressional and special-prosecutor investigations in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the origins of the Reagan-Iran relationship was always kept hazy. The Republicans were determined to stop any revelations about the 1980 contacts, but the Democrats were almost as reluctant to go there.A half-hearted congressional inquiry was launched in 1991 and depended heavily on then-President George H.W. Bush to collect the evidence and arrange interviews for the investigation. In other words, Bush, who was then seeking reelection and who was a chief suspect in the secret dealings with Iran, was entrusted with proving his own guilt.Tired of the StoryBy the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 October Surprise question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991.However, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israels exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 October Surprise case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Caseys attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages.Although the bogus Newsweek/New Republic London alibi would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the Presidents flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation.Meanwhile, Bushs State Department and White House counsels office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena.Years later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassys confirmation of Caseys trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape.Williamson said that among the State Department material potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was] a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown, Beach noted in a  memorandum for record  dated Nov. 4, 1991.Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beachs boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bushs reelection hopes in 1992.At the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bushs reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to kill/spike this story.Gray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. Whatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate October Surprise investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President , Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.]Among touchstones cited by Gray were No Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan. White House talking points on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings.Timid DemocratsBut Bushs White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received  and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993  there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagans election victory.That would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process  and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be good for the country.In 2014 when I sent a copy of Beachs memo regarding Caseys trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task forces dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue.The [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the trip to Madrid, Hamilton told me. Should they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that.Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task forces dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task forces investigation.If the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us, Hamilton said, adding that you have to rely on people in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquirys failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was nave in the extreme.Arguably, Hamiltons timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bushs team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamiltons investigative conclusion reinforced the group think dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a conspiracy theory when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasnt done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent.Still, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didnt make any sense .But the dismissive group think remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned. [For details, see s Americas Stolen Narrative or Trick or Treason: The 1980 October Surprise Mystery or Consortiumnews.coms  Second Thoughts on October Surprise. ]Past as PrologueLee Hamiltons decision to clear Reagan and Bush of the 1980 October Surprise suspicions in 1992 was not simply a case of miswriting history. The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bushs rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000.Indeed, if the full truth had been told about the fathers role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, its hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush stolen election in 2000.Regarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Floridas electoral votes and thus the presidency.The reality of Gores rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Floridas disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted.However, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be good for the country.So, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery  that the so-called over-votes in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the under-votes that hadnt registered on antiquated voting machines. Over-votes would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on clear intent of the voter.However, instead of leading with Gores rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred.On Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Gores victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for the good of the country, much as Johnsons team had done in 1968 regarding Nixons sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamiltons inquiry had done regarding the 1980 October Surprise case.Within a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didnt accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom.However, this violation of objective and professional journalism  bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle  was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future.By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000  even if the medias motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks  the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.coms  Gores Victory ,  So Bush Did Steal the White House , and  Bush v. Gores Dark American Decade. ]A Phalanx of Misguided ConsensusLooking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the stolen elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful losers are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters will had been ignored or twisted.Al Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Courts majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bushs legitimacy.Similarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern wise man, in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didnt ruffle too many feathers.But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies  uttered for the good of the country  is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest.So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isnt pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia.Trumps complaints about rigged elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they dont succeed at stealing the election from white people.There is a racist undertone to Trumps version of a rigged democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. Hes just not honest about what those flaws are.The hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracys gold standard; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.Investigative reporter  broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

By  " PIPR " - Imagine, Donald Trump would accede to the US Presidency, an unlikely event with the presstitute media relentlessly slamming, slashing and demonizing him, not unlike they do with President Putin  while cheering no-end for the warmonger Killary, no matter what atrocities she has on her hands and body, no matter that blood is dripping out of her mouth every time she opens it  like Iraq, Libya, Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan, Sudan  and more, much more. They, the elite, the military-security complex, the financial mafia, want more blood, more than is already covering the entire current Obama Administrations structure of psychopaths. Blood is weapons, blood is money, blood is more profit, blood is good for business  so said the Washington Post, just slightly translated from war is good for business. The warmongering MSM (mainstream media) also propagate for more weapons to enrich the military-security complex that pays them. But just for a moment, lets assume, Trump would get elected with such a large margin that voter fraud would be difficult to manage.Trump is sending a different narrative from that of eternal war. Trump seems to be looking into a different direction. He essentially says  stop the conflict with Russia, make Russia a partner, stop outsourcing jobs, bring them back, give labor back to Americans, slash the unemployment rate  which is, of course, everybody knows, way above the silly fabricated 5%. The reality is that unreported but real unemployment in the US is hovering between 22% and 25%, a real hammer for the economy, increasing anger and unhappiness and crime. Trump also says in the same vein as bringing back jobs  STOP globalization, restrain NATO, rein in the banks  yes, Wall Street, the Goldman Sachs-es and Co. of this world of fake pyramid money, dominated by the Rothschild-Rockefeller-Morgan clan. Trump says, lets have a financial system that works for the people.Does he mean it?  I dont know. Could be true. Most of what he says makes sense for America, for Americans  and by extension for much of the rest of the world, especially Europe, the genuine Europe, not the puppet-commandeered Europe. He also says a lot of outright discriminatory and xenophobic rubbish  like building a wall separating Mexico from the US of A, emulating Israel; and propagates a crackdown on Moslems. Does he mean it? Or does he want to please potential voters?  Such statements are indeed dangerous rubbish, but they are secondary to all the other things that are PRIORITARY, as they would help restore American society, workforce, dignity  most important: DIGNITY. Dignity is important for Americans to wake up to realize that they are living in a country that wastes their money, the peoples resources  on countless criminal wars around the world, feverishly racing towards Full Spectrum Dominance to benefit a few. The secondary stuff is important too, but can be dealt with in parallel by Americans that have come to senses.Trump is in many ways like Frances Marine LePen, representing the extreme right, and therefore, no matter what sensible things she says and has on her agenda to do  and I dont doubt one minute that she means what she says  like EUREXIT and send NATO to hell  she is still framed by the left intellectuals  if such a thing still exists in our neoliberal universe  as a discriminatory xenophobe who would expel all colored and veiled foreigners. Of course, thats bad. But let her first initiating France exiting from the EU, the Euro and NATO  the likely salvation of Europe, then tackle the other issues. First comes first. A true intellectual left would have to understand that  and not bend to the presstitute promoted clichs.Trump has enough money power. He doesnt have to bend to the military security complex, to the banks, to the Obamacare pharma-fiefdom. He doesnt really have to bend to anybody. That worries the elite. He is independent. Lets give him the benefit of the doubt. In no case could he be worse than Hillary  the killer  so much can be read from every word she says. Her pattern of pathology  We came, we saw, we won , when she saw the bloodstained image of the NATO-slaughtered Ghaddafi  indicates that she would not stop from pressing this infamous Red Button of Death and total world annihilation  perhaps even repeating that same smirk, , We came, we saw, we won .Now lets go to the next hypothesis, assuming Trump would be elected and they  the elusive high-powered small elite that pulls the strings on Washington and the White Houses overseas puppets, and lets assume they would let him live, at least for a while, Trump might be doing irrational things in the eye of the Beltway slaves. Recognizing the perils for his own country and those for his neighbor, Canada, Mr. Trump might call on the western stooges, in Europe particularly, who for the sake of brown-nosing the naked king in Washington, are prepared to sell-out 500-plus million European and their future generations to the most nefarious trade deals the world has ever known  CETA, TTIP and TiSA (let alone the TPP, where 12 Pacific countries are about to kiss ass in Washington)  telling them to come to senses, think democracy and stop the deals that 80% or more of Europeans despise and reject.As a parenthesis and philosophically speaking, one could say that given the hundreds of years of colonization around the globe, of shameless exploitation, of raping and killing millions of people throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America, that these trade deals are Europes historically deserved heritage.The Saker wrote a great essay on the aberration of this upcoming election and what might follow after the election, The US Is About To Face The Worst Crisis in Their History  http://www./article45729.htm . One of the articles commenters pinned it down to the point:  If Trump does become Commander in Chief, his first job will be securing his life. Those who really run the show in the US will stop at nothing to safeguard their empire. Truly the US is at a cross roads and by extension the world. Times are really scary .What Trump says he would do during his first 100 days in office, he presented in a groundbreaking speech at Gettysburg, Pa. this past weekend, is for the most part truly astounding http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/10/24/donald-trump-delivers-a-powerful-policy-speech-on-his-first-100-days-in-office/ . It is not less than revolutionary, because no US politician, let alone a Presidential candidate or President has said something for the most part so sensible as did Presidential candidate Trump. Summarizing, he promises bringing back overseas jobs, would prevent the continued outsourcing of the American production processes, bring order to the crime-ridden communities, he would seek friendly partnership with Russia, defusing the WWIII threat  and he would tackle, restrain and control the corrupt banking system, including the endless money-making machine, the privately owned, Rothschild dominated FED.  That is a challenge other Presidents have failed to master, including Lincoln and JFK. We know how they ended.Trump has already hinted that to revive the American economy the zero-interest policy may have to be changed, so that banks become more responsible. The owners off the system would hardly allow Trumps interference in their obscene profit-making scheme. Theyd rather at their calling let the bomb loose. A sudden change of this policy would hit many over-stretched banks like a bombshell  reminiscent of 2008 Lehman Brothers, just magnified by a factor of 10. There are currently at least three, possibly five Wall Street giants that are on the edge. They get by, because of the FEDs zero interest policy- and they make sure that this doesnt change, as several if not all of them are part of the private FED system. Would Trump dare touching this system?  Its a deadly challenge. He knows it.This time there may be more at stake then just another banking collapse, a planned emulation of the 2007 / 2008 crisis, where Wall Street was copiously rewarded for its excesses by tax-money bail-outs. Be aware, this time it would not be tax-payers money that would rescue the Too-Big-To Fail (TBTF) banks, but it would be YOUR money, your deposits, your savings, your pension funds, possibly even your shares if you have any in the bank being collapsed  and the process would be called bail-ins.The (western) world is under the hegemon of a privately-owned money system, the US-dollar  and most people dont even know it. The accent is on the western world , because the east, comprising Russia, China, the SCO countries (Shanghai Cooperation Organization  comprising China and Russia and most of the Central Asian former Soviet Republics, plus Iran and Pakistan  and others are waiting in the wings), the EEU (Eurasian Economic Union), as well as most of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), are forming their own eastern economic and monetary block.  I have said this before, but will repeat it for readers to realize  this economic block  is largely, if not entirely, delinked from the dollar scheme. It consists of about half the worlds population and one third of the worlds GDP, a solid GDP that is. In contrast to the western, especially the US GDP; in the eastern block much of the GDP is based on real labor output and manufacturing.In reality, this eastern economic power block which is also displaying the worlds largest economic development potential, since history remembers, the New Silk Road  or the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) economic development scheme, stretching from Vladivostok to Lisbon (if Europe chooses to participate), does not need the west anymore. The OBOR project has already begun. It represents a view into the future, with job opportunities and the outlook for a truly better life for hundreds of millions, possibly billions of people during coming generations  a dynamic vision for the future. The east is where the future lays.-Donald Trump as President notwithstanding, a new western well-planned banking collapse may start in the US, the ramifications and impact would be felt around the globe  sinking millions, hundreds of millions of people into poverty, misery, the like we havent seen in recent history. The banks depositors money might not be enough. The reptiles are hungry. They might privatize public properties, infrastructures, roads, ports railways, health care, education, pensions, natural resources  anything that is still in the hands of the people. If Greece is a reminder, then think of Greece blown up by a factor of 1000  all around the globe, touching in extremis the vulnerable people of the vulnerable countries  billions of people. While the money flows again from the poor to the rich, to an ever-shrinking pool of super-rich; widening the rich-poor gap to a disgusting yawn. Leaving the 99.99 %  by now the 99. % ever more powerless, having to fend for sheer survival  seeking refuge in better lands  Its a war by money. Canons, bombs and guns could rest  for a while.For years, I have felt the Empire will have to be brought down from inside  from the people who cant take it anymore, from an internal revolt that eventually would break the worldwide extended monsters back. Rome and most subsequent empires have fallen this way. It may still happen. But now I side more with The Sakers theory, namely that the defeat may come from a combination of inside revolt and outside forces, not so much military forces, but economic forces. In theory, it could happen tomorrow. Just imagine, the one third of world-GDP-countries would drop all their dollar reserves, all the dollar denominated international contracts, all dollar issued trade agreements  and in particular, abandon at once the unwritten rule of hydrocarbons to be traded only in US-dollars. It would most likely wipe out the western economy.This will not happen, of course. Simply, because the One Third GDP holders do not want to destroy the economy of the rest of the world, especially the so-called developing and emerging countries, many  or most of them  eventually to become allies of this eastern block that promises peaceful co-existence rather than the current western pattern of ever multiplying wars and conflicts  a sheer dollar-fed killing spree, with destruction and weapons manufacturing no end.The Power of Money. Would Donald Trump, as President, himself a moneyed powerhouse, survive such a calamity? In fact, would he be able and strong enough to veer the ship around, guiding the world away from such destructive scenarios and towards peace and cooperation between East and West?  Or is the train already too far out of the station?  No telling at this time. The signals are certainly not good. But, lets put in a grain of optimism and bank on a positive strand of dynamics fueled by an increasing human consciousness  one that would not allow Hillary to push the Death Button. is an economist and geopolitical analyst.

 The elite realize that their time is short Image Credits: donaldjtrump.com . At the third debate, Donald Trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election. Trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it. The media went berserk claiming that Trump was undermining democracy. But is the US system really rigged? And if it is, can Trump overcome it? Why rig the system? Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. Revelation 12:12 It is human nature to want to accumulate wealth. It is also human nature to want to keep what you have. One of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them. A democratic republic is particularly easy to influence. The wealthy elite can buy candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs.
 By     Louis XVI needed a revolution; Napoleon needed two historic military defeats; the Spanish Empire in the New World needed multiple revolutions; the Russian Czar needed a communist revolution; the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empire needed World War I; Nazi Germany needed World War II; Imperial Japan needed two atomic bombs; the Portuguese Empire in Africa needed a military coup at home; the Soviet Empire needed Mikhail Gorbachev . . . What will the American Empire need? I dont believe anyone will consciously launch World War III. The situation now is more like the eve of World War I, when great powers were armed and ready to go when an incident set things off. Ever since Gorbachev naively ended the Cold War, the hugely over-armed United States has been actively surrounding Russia with weapons systems, aggressive military exercises, NATO expansion. At the same time, in recent years the demonization of Vladimir Putin has reached war propaganda levels. Russians have every reason to believe that the United States is preparing for war against them, and are certain to take defensive measures. This mixture of excessive military preparations and propaganda against an evil enemy make it very easy for some trivial incident to blow it all up. Diana Johnstone, author of Queen of Chaos: The Misadventures of Hillary Clinton In September 2013 President Obama stood before the United Nations General Assembly and declared, I believe America is exceptional. The following year at the UN, the president classified Russia as one of the three threats to the world along with the Islamic State and the ebola virus. On March 9, 2015 President Barack Obama declared Venezuela an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States. Vladimir Putin, speaking at the UN in 2015, addressing the United States re its foreign policy: Do you realize what you have done? Since the end of World W Attempted to overthrow Dropped bombs Attempted to assassinate Attempted to suppress The Plan is for the United States to rule the world. The overt theme is unilateralism, but it is ultimately a story of domination. It calls for the United States to maintain its overwhelming superiority and prevent new rivals from rising up to challenge it on the world stage. It calls for dominion over friends and enemies alike. It says not that the United States must be more powerful, or most powerful, but that it must be absolutely powerful. Two flew over the cuckoos nest: We are, as a matter of empirical fact and undeniable history, the greatest force for good the world has ever known. . . . security and freedom for millions of people around the globe have depended on Americas military , economic, political, and diplomatic might. War with Russia will be nuclear. Washington has prepared for it. Washington has abandoned the ABM treaty, created what it thinks is an ABM shield, and changed its war doctrine to permit US nuclear first strike. All of this is obviously directed at Russia, and the Russian government knows it. How long will Russia sit there waiting for Washingtons first strike? Iran signed the nuclear accords with the United States earlier this year by agreeing to stop what it never was doing. Any Iranian nuclear a US General Barry McCaffrey, April 2015: Because so far NATOs reaction to Putins aggression has been to send a handful of forces to the Baltics to demonstrate resolve, which has only convinced Putin that the alliance is either unable or unwilling to fight. So we had better change his calculus pretty soon, and contest Putins stated doctrine that he is willing to intervene militarily in other countries to protect Russia-speaking people. For Gods sake, the last time we heard that was just before Hitler invaded the Sudetenland. No, my dear general, we heard that repeatedly in 1983 when the United States invaded the tiny nation of Grenada to protect and rescue hundreds of Americans who supposedly were in danger from the new leftist government. It was all a fraud, no more than an excuse to overthrow a government that that didnt believe that the American Empire was Gods gift to humanity. Since 1980, the United States has intervened in the affairs of fourteen Muslim countries, at worst invading or bombing them. They are (in chronological order) Iran, Libya, Lebanon, Kuwait, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo, Yemen, Pakistan, and now Syria. How our never-ending Mideast horror began: Radio Address of George W. Bush, September 28, 2002: The Iraqi regime possesses biological and chemical weapons, is rebuilding the facilities to make more and, according to the British government, could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as 45 minutes after the order is given. The regime has long-standing and continuing ties to terrorist groups, and there are al Qaeda terrorists inside Iraq. This regime is seeking a nuclear bomb, and with fissile material could build one within a year. Yet . . . just six weeks before 9/11, Condoleezza Rice told CNN: Lets remember that his [Saddams] country is divided, in effect. He does not control the northern part of his country. We are able to keep his arms from him. His military forces have not been rebuilt. The fact is that there is more participation by the Cuban population in the running of their country than there is by the American population in the running of theirs. One important reason is the absence of the numerous private corporations which, in the United States, exert great influence over all aspects of life. The U.S. is frantically surrounding China with military weapons, advanced aircraft, naval fleets and a multitude of military bases from Japan, South Korea and the Philippines through several nearby smaller Pacific islands to its new and enlarged base in Australia . . . The U.S. naval fleet, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines patrol Chinas nearby waters. Warplanes, surveillance planes, drones and spying satellites cover the skies, creating a symbolic darkness at noon. (Jack A. Smith, Hegemony Games: USA vs. PRC, CounterPunch) SRs leader Nikita Khrushchev, a native of the region, had donated Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Crimeans were always strongly opposed to that change and voted overwhelmingly to rejoin Russia after the US-induced Ukrainian coup in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin refers to the Ukrainian army as NATOs foreign legion, which does not pursue Ukraines national interests. The United States, however, insists on labeling the Russian action in Crimea as an invasion. Putin re Crimea/Ukraine: Our western partners created the Kosovo precedent with their own hands. In a situation absolutely the same as the one in Crimea they recognized Kosovos secession from Serbia legitimate while arguing that no permission from a countrys central authority for a unilateral declaration of independence is necessary . . . And the UN International Court of Justice agreed with those arguments. Thats what they said; thats what they trumpeted all over the world and coerced everyone to acceptand now they are complaining about Crimea. Why is that? Paul Craig Roberts: The absurdity of it all! Even a moron knows that if Russia is going to put tanks and troops into Ukraine, Russia will put in enough to do the job. The war would be over in a few days if not in a few hours. As Putin himself said some months ago, if the Russian military enters Ukraine, the news will not be the fate of Donetsk or Mauriupol, but the fall of Kiev and Lviv. In a major examination of US policy vis--vis China, published in March 2015, the authoritative Council on Foreign Relations bluntly declared that there is no real prospect of building fundamental trust, peaceful coexistence, mutual understanding, a strategic partnership, or a new type of major country relations between the United States and China. The United States, the report declares, must, therefore, develop the political will and military capabilities to deal with China to protect vital U.S. interests. military from hemispheric defensean outdated relic of World War IIto internal security, which means war against the domestic population. Noam Chomsky Cuban baseball players who are paid a million dollars to play for an American team are not defectors, a word which has a clear political connotation. Boris Yeltsin was acceptable to American and Europeans because he was seen as a weak, pliable figure that allowed Western capital free rein in the newly opened Russian territory following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Yeltsins era was also a time of rampant corruption by Russian oligarchs who were closely associated with Western capital. That corrosive culture came to a halt with the election of Vladimir Putin twice as president between 20002008, and again in 2012. Many ISIS leaders were former Iraqi military officers who were imprisoned by American troops. The fight isnt against ISIS, its against Assad; at the next level it isnt against Assad, its against Putin; then, at the next level, it isnt against Putin, its against the country most likely to stand in the way of US world domination, Russia. And its forever. Connecting to the US-based Internet would mean channeling all of Cubas communications directly to the NSA. George W. Bush has been living a comparatively quiet life in Texas, with a focus on his paintings. Im trying to leave something behind, he said a couple of years ago. Yeah, right, George. We can stand up some of the paintings against the large piles of Iraqi dead bodies. Seymour Hirsch: America would be much better off, if, 30 years ago, we had let Russia continue its war in Afghanistan . . . The mistake was made by the Carter administration which was trying to stop the Russians from their invasion of Afghanistan. Wed be better off had we let the Russians beat the Taliban. ( Deutsche Welle , April 2, 2014 interview) Wed be even better off if we hadnt overthrown the progressive, secular Afghan government, giving rise to the Taliban in the first place and inciting the Russians to intervene on their border lest the Soviet Islamic population was stirred up. The former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in an interview in 1998 summed up exactly what the US thinks of the UN: The UN plays a very important role. But if we dont like it, we always have the option of following our own national security interests, which I assure you we will do if we dont like whats going on.

We could call it the war, air and fiscal crimes tribunal and we could put politicians and CEOs and major media owners in the dock with earphones like Eichmann and make them listen to the evidence of how they killed millions of people and almost murdered the planet and made most of us far more miserable than we needed to be. Of course, we wouldnt have time to go after them one by one. Wed have to lump Wall Street investment bankers in one trial, the Council on Foreign Relations in another, and any remaining Harvard Business School or Yale Law graduates in a third.

Sam Smith I have come to think of the export of democracy as the contemporary equivalent of what missionaries have always done in the interest of conquering and occupying the uncivilized world on behalf of the powers that be. I have said that the church invented the concept of conversion by any means, including torture and killing of course, as doing the victims a big favor, since it was in the interest of saving their immortal souls. It is now called, democratization. Rita Corriel It is more or less impossible to commemorate the war dead without glorifying them, and it is impossible to glorify them without glorifying their wars. Paul Craig Roberts
 By     A populist wave that began with Brexit in June became a tsunami as Trumps cyclone hit Washington Tuesday night, leaving the capital in a shambles. His is a story straight out of Grimms fairytales. the peasants rose up. The phony civility of the neoconservative nightmare that Americans (and the world) have endured for years is cracking. Trumps victory is pure protest by the masses. Exciting, but disturbing, as Trump is just another billionaire. He will be sure to look after his own, but then again, maybe he can stare them down. Fortunately, there is the Republican Congress and Senate to provide stability as the upstart get his feet on the ground. The weakened Democrats will have to fight extra hard after years of complacency under the nice, liberal Obama. For critics of media control by the Israel lobby in the US, and the sham elections where money rules, the victory shattered this paradigm. Though the Masters of Discourse control the entirety of world media, and they decide what people may think and say from Canada to Hong Kong, only you, American citizens, can defeat them. Trump has a great quality making him fit for the task: he is impervious to labels and libels. He had been called everything in the book: anti-Semite, racist, women hater, you name it. And he still survived that flak. Such people are very rare, writes Israel Shamir. Almost all presidents since Jimmy Carter have campaigned as outsiders. Reagan, Bill Clinton, Bush jr, Obama. But they were all seasoned politicians and all disappointed. President Trumpthink: Governor Ventura There is a precedent of a boorish outsider, made famous and pilloried in the media, who catapulted into the political world. His name is Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler who served as the 38th Governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003. He was the first member of the Reform Party to win a major government position, now in the Independence Party of Minnesota. He surprised everyone with a sober, uncorrupt term in office, reforming taxation and constructing the METRO Blue Line light rail in MinneapolisSaint Paul. He shattered the Republican-Democratic stranglehold and no one suffered. Trump has shattered it again. He makes a path open to a third party or independent candidate in the future. Trumps trump card Trumps final ad, a 2-minute masterpiece of populist rhetoric infuriated the ADL for hinting the obvious: the forces of international finance that have their own agenda for the US, behind our backs, and whose agent is/was Hillary Clinton. He depicted a global power structure that is bleeding America dry with horrible trade deals that enrich elites and open the gates to mass immigration. The people behind this globalist takeover include George Soros, Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen and Goldman Sachs Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, with the implication that Clinton is their minion. The Clinton machine is at the center of this power structure. Weve seen this first hand in the WikiLeaks documents, in which Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends and her donors, charged Trump. That jab alone was worth more than all of Hillarys millions spent on ads attacking him for peccadilloes. Now the intelligent Republicans are waking up. Trumps words are branded in their minds. That alone makes the election historic. The ADls slander of Trumpthis ad touches on images and rhetoric that anti-Semites have used for agemerely alerted Americans to the emptiness of the anti-Semitic slur. If something is true, pointing it out is not bigotry. Senior House deputy whip Dennis Ross of Florida lauds Trump for his known ability as negotiator. Sure, he might toss out statements like build a wall, or no Muslims, and say something sensational. But then he knows how to give in a bit and come up with a solution. House Speaker Paul Ryan publicly disowned Trump during the campaign, and now has to eating crow. The closest modern comparison of an outsider president and a speaker of the same political party may be the fractious relationship during the late 1970s between Democrats President Jimmy Carter and House Speaker Tip ONeill. Carters team didnt have an appreciation for how the system worked in Washington and struggled to advance his agenda. New American ball game The Republican win in the Congress and Senate, with a Republican president, offers a chance to produce meaningful change. Will Trump develop more concern for the environment and work to help the millions of poor Americans who put their trust in him? He has a huge responsibility to repay his voters and give hope for reconciliation with his opponents. There is much soul searching to be done now, on both sides of the divide in American political life. The election represents a call to action for people to fight hard to save the environment, rebuild a county falling apart, and demand a responsible US foreign policy. Democracy only works when we all take part. People are awakening from their Wall St induced sleep. Look for a new Occupy Wall St and peace campaigning. Thats the bright side. Trumps policies on the Middle East and Iran are confused and incoherent. Lets hope that his friendship with Vladimir Putin portends realism, and the ability and intent to change the US imperial mindset that plagues the world. The French are just as furious with the same scenario there. Trumps victory makes a victory for the Front National s Marine Le Pen more likely. The American peoplefree! Le Pen tweeted as Trumps count reached the threshold of victory. It also gives energy to Britains vote to leave the European Union. Protest candidates throughout Europe have gained votes and seats in many countries, and entered government coalitions in 11 Western democracies, including in Austria, Italy and Switzerland. This wave of protest is gathering momentum. The American people have the chance now, and the responsibility, to help shape where Trump will take his revolution. Whether he can work with his foreign counterparts to create a peoples new world order, not the one Bush Sr. promised in 1991 and that Bush Jr. failed to achieve. Foreign policy has too long been off limits, done by elites behind closed doors. Government has to listen to the people now, after years of passivity and policies shaped by the elite. Trump made serious promises to revitalize American. People will now hold him to them. Canadian  is known worldwide as a journalist specializing in the Middle East, Central Asia and Russia.

   Tweet Its true, in Europe you need to hide in the woods to speak good about trump. Do your news even report a fraction of the things I see in this sub? In Germany not a single bad thing about Hillary gets reported.
 by   October 27, 2016 Tweet Following our story yesterday, there have been more reports of early voters in Texas seeing their ballots flipped from Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton. Voters in Arlington and Amarillo complained that when they highlighted the box to select Trump/Pence, it switched to Clinton/Kaine. Now numerous other Texans have gone public on social media to report similar problems. However, election officials in Texas are denying that there is a problem. Typically, weve found its voter error with the equipment, Frank Phillips, Tarrant Countys election administrator, told WFAA . Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates   or do something with the wheel .There is not an issue with the equipment. Are all these examples just voters making mistakes or inaccurately reporting what happened? Or could there be a real problem with electronic voting machines in Texas? http://www.infowars.com/more-reports-of-votes-flipping-from-trump-to-clinton-in-texas/ An ongoing CBS4 VOTER FRAUD investigation Finds People Voting Twice DENVER (CBS4) An ongoing CBS4 voter fraud investigation has uncovered a dozen cases where Coloradans are suspected of voting twice. Previous CBS4 Investigations revealed ballots cast in the names of Coloradans who had been dead for months sometimes years- before votes were cast in their names. In six of the new cases, voting records show the same people voting twice in Colorado elections. In another six cases, people are suspected of voting in Colorado and another state during the same election cycle. http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/10/25/cbs4-investigation-finds-people-voting-twice/ Voting Machine Caught on Camera Casting Ballot for Democrat when Selecting Republican Early voting has only been underway for two whole and were already facing a glitch in the system. Chambers County was forced to pull the plug on their voting machines and turn to the paper ballot due to a software problem. All electronic voting has been stopped until the software can be updated. http://kluv.cbslocal.com/2016/10/26/chambers-county-texas-switches-to-paper-ballots/ Florida Governor Busted Attempting To Toss Thousands Of Mail-In Ballots A federal judge on Saturday blocked Florida Governor Rick Scotts attempt to throw out tens of thousands of mail-in ballots, then publicly reprimanded him. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued a blistering caution to Scotts top election official on a lawsuit about vote-by-mail ballots. According to ABC News , the judge accused Governor Scott appointed Secretary of State Ken Detzner of delaying a hearing on the lawsuit, so that he could use every second available to run out the clock, . That means, there would not be enough time to address the lawsuit. Then, Judge Walker said the governors man, Detzner, was in effect committing an undeclared war on Florida voters rights. Floridas Democratic Party filed a lawsuit asserting that thousands of vote-by-mail ballots were rejected each election, because the voters ballot envelope and the registration file signatures do not match. Without a signature, Florida law says that a vote-by-mail ballot cannot be counted.
Woohoo, he slammed this nasty heifer! Jones said of Gingrich in a tweet she has since deleted but is screen captured below. Jones immediately caught flak from Twitter users for calling Kelly a name. @megmcsweeney wrong .she only believes the so called trump victims .hypocrite!
 by   October 27, 2016 Are the elite foreshadowing the future of America?! It seems so. All throughout the month of October, mainstream media has made cryptic statements, scenarios, and outcomes regarding what America could look like if Donald Trump loses the presidential race. In an article from The Boston Globe, one scenario includes a potential American uprising. During the presidential debates and campaigns, Mr. Trump has alleged the election as being rigged, in favor of Hillary Clinton. According to a Bloomberg News poll, 56% of Trump backers believe the election will be rigged  even though the election is really a SELECTION. However, The Washington Times has also questioned the same thing: Will there be some type of uprising, civil unrest, or some other triggered outcome if Donald Trump were to lose the elections? Its also very cryptic to note how former Republican Joe Walsh made this interesting Twitter statement as of October 26th, 2016: If Trump loses, Im grabbing my musket. Then theres the Russian threat, which is constantly making its way into mainstream news. According to Western sources, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is an ally of Vladimir Putin, has warned Americans to vote trump or face nuclear war  claiming that the Republican candidate is the only person who can prevent an escalation in tensions between Moscow and Washington. He has also said that: The only way they can get worse is if a war starts. And while the American government continues to constantly blame Russia for alleged cyberthreats, cyberattacks, and election hacks  we know this is all propaganda in preparation for world war. Do The Elite Know Something We DONT?!?! LEARN MORE!
Region: USA in the World So why did the US Secretary of State John Kerry going to the South Pole, as US presidential elections were being held on November 8, 2016, and why was the news provided late in the game and as an unexpected surprise? One need to keep in mind that many US states allowed early voting, so millions of Americans had already cast their ballots beforehand; they and perhaps Kerry too did not have to be in their home districts on polling day, or perhaps he did not want to wait in long lines like in places like Ohio where the number of polling stations were reduced to keep some categories from voting. Presumably John Kerry is not one of these and his vote would have been counted. It will be remembered that Kerry stood for president himself, against George W. Bush, and would have beaten him if he had won Ohio, which he failed to do by only a few thousand votes. So you would imagine a man of such experience and seniority would be out on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton right until the polls close in the East of the country, which is when candidates traditionally claim victory or concede defeat. But Kerry wasnt even in the country in November 8th. He was considered so important that he had been sent to  of all places  the South Pole. While the rest of his party was hard campaigning for Clinton he was chilling it at the US military-scientific facilities there, apparently looking into something to do with  environmental policy  which wasnt part of his job description last time anyone looked. However, perhaps now, in retrospect, he knew the election results that many are now claiming was a total surprisehow all the poll results were wrong and the American people had spoken in rejecting the status quo, and all what Clinton and those who stand behind her stand for. Nonetheless, on a lighter note, no one knows the full extent of the US footprint in Antarctica as it is all classified. The bases there are known primarily for drug abuse, which was once widespread, with the US itself supplying the drugs to its own employees as it did in Vietnam. But Kerrys visit there was unlikely to have influenced the outcome of the election, or indeed much else. Unless the US is willfully changing the environment of regional countries from its Antarctic bases it seems very odd that Kerry should have gone to the South Pole, and then followed up with a tour of the Southern hemisphere countries, to discuss such an issue at such an inopportune time. So why was Kerry sent to the South Pole, about as far away from the election as possible? There are plenty of possibilities, many of which are credible. But as ever, the most unlikely one is the most likely to be true  and it isnt pretty. Poles not so far apart One day the performance artist Laurie Anderson decided she would go and visit the North Pole, just like that. She managed to get near it and found it was a restricted area, owned by the US military, so she couldnt actually reach the pole itself . Andersons North Pole trip was in 1974. Five years later a New Zealand airliner crashed into one of the Antarctic mountains, or so we were told. As a result, all civilian over flights of the South Pole were also banned. The US doesnt extend as far north as the North Pole, or as far south as the South Pole, but they have somehow become US-controlled territory regardless, part of the vast swathe of land where the US exacts different forms of taxation without giving the inhabitants representation. In Merab Ratishvilis novel White Lama the leading character ends up going to the South Pole. He finds a gap in the ice and discovers a hidden colony of very tall psychics, who live in a temperate climate and grow tropical fruit trees . That is only a story, but it is based on a real event: the attempted Nazi colonisation of Antarctica in 1938. These characters are alleged to be descendants of those Nazis, maintained by foreign powers for the own purposes . For many years it has been rumoured that the Nazis built some sort of scientific-military base in Antarctica. They are most unlikely to have gone all that way on a fishing expedition. As their victims knew, the Nazis were very well-organised and efficient. We know for example that if they had invaded England they were intending to use the town of Bridgenorth as their UK operations base  a very sensible choice, as it is near the geographical centre of the UK, between its two main industrial hubs of the time and gives easy access to all the important cross-country transport and communications routes. Operation Highjump After the Second World War a number of leading Nazis were spirited away to the US on ratlines so that they would neither stand trial for their crimes or have their knowledge fall into the hands of the Russians. In 1947 US Admiral Richard E. Byrd led 4,000 American , British and Australian troops in an invasion of Antarctica called Operation Highjump. This and at least one follow-up expedition was called off because the troops came under attack by what are described as flying saucers. Even in the country whose citizens went running to the hills when Orson Welles told them that the Martians had landed their military do not run away from flying saucers. Why is the US unable to describe what forces were unleashed against the invasion force, and by whom? What truth is so frightening it has to be shrouded in science fiction terms in order for people to dismiss the reports? Whatever the Nazis did in Antarctica, the US probably found out about it. The US biolab in Tbilisi is one of a number of dubious former Soviet facilities it has taken over and turned into restricted areas in the same way. It would be in character for the US Antarctic base to have once been operated by a foreign power, and have been taken over for scientific purposes most self-respecting scientists would never touch, those with military applications the US always denies until it can gain political capital from them. Cats among the penguins Kerry does have an indirect connection with the Nazis. Like the Bush family, he too is part of the Skull n Bones secret society. George Bush Srs father, Prescott Bush, ran the Bank of America which financed the Nazi Partys initial bid for power, and got its own money from somewhere. Antarctic expeditions cost a lot of money, particularly when a country is spending vast amounts on armament production preparing for war. Kerry may have a personal connection with whatever is going on down there now, which the US keeps strictly under wraps. But there are also precedents for sending important people to the South Pole at historic turning points, which this US election is bound to be, whoever wins. The most famous concerned Colonel Leroy Fletcher Prouty, Chief of Special Operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President John F. Kennedy. He was on his way to the South Pole on a government mission at the time John F. Kennedy was shot, and for the rest of his life maintained that that was not a coincidence but a deliberate attempt to get him out of the way so that he could not impede what he later stated was a plot. Prouty retired from military service soon after the assassination, despite the siren call of the pension, and always maintained that the CIA assassinated Kennedy to prevent him taking it over after the Bay of Pigs fiasco in Cuba. He also maintained that the CIA itself answered to a shadowy global elite rather than the US government, and that this elite acts with impunity throughout the world. If so, it does so through secret societies, like Skull n Bones. As Colonel Prouty had worked in senior CIA roles for years he had considerable inside knowledge of how that organisation operated and who did what. He was dismissed as a crackpot, as all those who dispute the official version of the Kennedy assassination are, but his claim that Edward Lansdale, the basis of Burdick and Lederers novel The Ugly American, was present at the scene as one of the Three Tramps is perfectly consistent with what the public knows about Lansdale and his work, let alone what Prouty must have known. We should all hope that no one is planning a political assassination. But there is some reason why Kerry was being kept out of the way. We can speculate what his connections with the shadowy global elite are, but we know his connections with the US government. If the government wanted him out of the way on Election Day, with all his campaign experience, we can assume that whatever someone doesnt want him to see, or he himself doesnt want to be implicated in, involves the current US administration itself. He who knows least lives longest Though various Americans once claimed to have been the first man to reach the North Pole the claims of each one were disputed, largely by other Americans. The first people who undoubtedly reached the North Pole were the crew of the airship Norge, which flew over it in 1926. Their commander was Roland Amundsen, who had also famously been the first person to reach the South Pole in 1912, that time by land . Amundsen did not enjoy this triumph for long, as he disappeared along with his plane and five crewmen two years later. He was searching for the missing crew of the Airship Italia, commanded by one of his 1926 crew, Umberto Nobile. Neither most of Amundsens plane, or any of the bodies, have ever been found. The Airship Italia disaster aroused a lot of suspicion at the time and since. The Italian government refused to fund this polar flight. When the airship crashed one of the crew twice tried to commit suicide. The Italian ship supposedly monitoring the distress signals from the survivors ignored them and the Italian government made no attempt to rescue its stranded citizens. Eventually Captain Nobile and his pet dog were rescued while his men were left on the ice, most unusually, and many of these later disappeared without trace, just as Amundsen was later to do, having volunteered as a private citizen to lead a rescue attempt. Maybe Nobile himself didnt know what his polar mission was supposed to accomplish. But it was clearly something people in high places did know, and were embarrassed by. Amundsens death left Nobile as the person who knew more about the two poles than anyone else, and he was subject to a smear campaign which had the effect of damaging anything he might say later, just as the one against Prouty did. Now we have a situation where the poles are considered so important that they are restricted areas controlled by the worlds only superpower. But few people fight over other inhospitable areas. This is why various Eskimo and desert peoples are allowed to continue their traditional way of life, rather than being forcibly civilized by great powers, as, for example, the highly cultured Tibetans are by the Chinese. This changes when energy resources are involved. But even then the oil and gas-rich zones do not become restricted. They may be taken over by big corporations working hand in glove with foreign governments, but what they are doing is trumpeted to the skies, not restricted to an inner circle which probably doesnt include most of those carrying out the work. Frozen before the politicians get there John Kirby, the man who is trying to minimise terrorism and helping John Kerry prevent the Saudi government being prosecuted for their part in 9/11, was apparently expecting to go along with Kerry to the South Pole base when he gave his briefing. We do not know what is going on at the US South Pole base but we do know what is happening at some other US bases with a similar classified level. In each case, what we know is connected with terrorism: manufacturing biological weapons, arming and training terrorists, spying on the local population and then strangely failing to discover successful terrorist outrages in advance, despite the US admitting straight after them that it knows a great deal about the terrorists involved. At one time the Southern hemisphere wasnt a problem to the US. A string of compliant democratic governments and military dictatorships kept things under control well enough, despite some local terrorist groups doing their best to remove them. It could concentrate on other parts of the globe, like the Middle East, and simply send in new diplomats, or CIA torture trainers, to sort out any government that started backsliding. Now the worm has begun to turn. The Broad Left remains in control of Uruguay, despite being composed of former urban guerrillas who were tortured by previous US-backed regimes. Philippines president Roberto Duerte is cosying up to China and telling the US it has lost an ally, and despite his backtracking on this in later statements his new deals with China remain in place . Chile and Paraguay have elected leaders determined to move on from the US-controlled past, and even Nauru, the tiny phosphate-rich but future-challenged Pacific state, is selling itself to the highest bidder, a new one every week, whatever the US thinks about it . So there are reasons Kerry wanted to go to the Southern hemisphere and find new levers of influence. But he doesnt know whether he will be Secretary of State after the election, or who any new Secretary of State will report to. Whatever Kerry does now the new US president, Donald Trump, will just have to tolerate. Of course Kerry cannot take overtly political initiatives without knowing who the new president was going to be. But he started his diplomatic tour by having visited the South Pole  as mysterious, but nevertheless blatant, a command and control centre as the US has anywhere, as its own behaviour towards it makes clear. It may well be true that Kerry went to the South Pole to keep him away from something serious the US government or Soros funded NGOs are planning. But more likely his job may be to take actions which will forestall anything a new government might want to dosuch as draining the swamp. Such actions are not likely to be legal or desirable actions if they began with a visit to the US South Pole base. Whoever Kerry was really working on a highly-contested election day remains a big question; it was likely someone whose interest is in a transparent government, rule of law which are the kind of things a real democratic system is supposed to stand for.

They reveal the story of the world economy. Central bankers have done their best to conjure forth inflation in the hopes that this will vanquish deflation but the risk is that our daily lives, and the sustainability of governments, will be affected by an ongoing battle between these two forces. There will be important consequences. Quantitative Easing is now catching people in a vice by pushing up their cost of living even as their income is still falling. This breaks the vital social contracts between citizens and their governments and sets in motion many seemingly unrelated outcomes: social unrest in emerging markets, the movement of manufacturing and jobs back to the US and the West, improvements to the value added of emerging market firms, higher food and energy prices. The rising price, but shrinking size, of a steak, a candy bar and an apartment not only cause pain at home, they also propel some nations to deploy their militaries to secure resources and protect their citizens from the ill effects of inflation and deflation alike. This is already resulting in military confrontations, incidents and near misses between American, Chinese and Russian planes, warships and submarines. The solution is growth and innovation. Luckily, anonymous individuals are balancing their hubris against the risk of failure and proceeding to build a more dynamic economy and the new social contracts that will exist tomorrow. The only question is whether governments are hostile or hospitable to these efforts. By being alert to the many signals around us anyone can better navigate through the turbulence to the treasures of the world economy instead of being continuously overwhelmed and surprised by it. All the Presidents Bankers: The Hidden Alliances that Drive American Power  Who rules America? All the Presidents Bankers is a groundbreaking narrative of how an elite group of men transformed the American economy and government, dictated foreign and domestic policy, and shaped world history. Culled from original presidential archival documents, All the Presidents Bankers delivers an explosive account of the hundred-year interdependence between the White House and Wall Street that transcends a simple analysis of money driving politicsor greed driving bankers. Prins ushers us into the intimate world of exclusive clubs, vacation spots, and Ivy League universities that binds presidents and financiers. She unravels the multi-generational blood, intermarriage, and protg relationships that have confined national influence to a privileged cluster of people. These families and individuals recycle their power through elected office and private channels in Washington, DC. All the Presidents Bankers sheds new light on pivotal historic eventssuch as why, after the Panic of 1907, Americas dominant bankers convened to fashion the Federal Reserve System; how J. P. Morgans ambitions motivated President Wilson during World War I; how Chase and National City Bank chairmen worked secretly with President Roosevelt to rescue capitalism during the Great Depression while J.P. Morgan Jr. invited Roosevelts son yachting; and how American financiers collaborated with President Truman to construct the World Bank and IMF after World War II. Prins divulges how, through the Cold War and Vietnam era, presidents and bankers pushed Americas superpower status and expansion abroad, while promoting broadly democratic values and social welfare at home. But from the 1970s, Wall Streets rush to secure Middle East oil profits altered the nature of political-financial alliances. Bankers profit motive trumped heritage and allegiance to public service, while presidents lost control over the economyas was dramatically evident in the financial crisis of 2008. This unprecedented history of American power illuminates how the same financiers retained their authoritative position through history, swaying presidents regardless of party affiliation. All the Presidents Bankers explores the alarming global repercussions of a system lacking barriers between public office and private power. Prins leaves us with an ominous choice: either we break the alliances of the power elite, or they will break us. About author
25 Views November 10, 2016 GOLD , KWN  For people who are worried about Druckenmiller selling his gold  Before we get to Druckenmiller selling his gold, look at the collapse in the 30-year bond market as interest rates continue to surge! A picture is worth a thousand words  30-Year U.S. Treasuries Continue To Plunge Today, Hitting New Lows! By Bill Fleckenstein President Of Fleckenstein Capital November 10 (  )  I am going to stick with yesterdays format and try to make sense of the market motion, then turn to the action lower in the column, and Im doing this in response to all the questions Ive been getting about how various markets can possibly do what theyre doing, i.e., why are they behaving as they are  IMPORTANT: To find out which company Doug Casey, Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that already has a staggering 18.1 million ounces of gold that just added another massive deposit and is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest gold opportunities in the world  CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored Great Again: Well, That Didnt Take Long In the first place, lets be clear, this is all guesswork, and a lot of the motion is noise and the overlapping of extremely short-term time horizons with longer ones. Be that as it may, I will give it my best shot. What we have seen over the last 48 to 72 hours is a massive psychological sea-change  albeit, almost certainly temporary  from overwhelming pessimism to overwhelming optimism regarding the prospects for the U.S. economy and all things American. That has collided with fumes from QE here, and actual QE from other counties. Said differently, a massive change in psychology has collided with free money to spark euphoria, something that can generally only last a short time. As that begins to take place people begin to factor in all the things that can go right and very few of the things that can go wrong, though they dont handicap the amount of time it takes to accomplish said things, nor the degree of difficulty in accomplishing them. For instance, if Congress magically passed a $1 trillion infrastructure project, it would take quite a good deal of time to get the permits and design what needs to happen before the first shovels hit the dirt, so to speak. Not to say that the consequences of doing the project wouldnt be economically positive, but there is quite a long lag between planning to do it and actually starting it. That matters because, at the moment, the multiple on the stock market is very high (north of 20), and it is where it is because of zero-percent rates (and the ridiculous TINA rationale). As rates rise, that tends to put pressure on valuations while it potentially causes some TINA-driven buyers to think twice, especially if they start to lose money. Given my belief that the bond bull market is finished, and that a Trump administration would likely be very unfriendly to bonds, interest rates are headed higher, something that could really be exacerbated if peoples perceptions about inflation change. Buy and Hold On? The bottom line is, given the valuation of the stock market and the likely decline in bonds, it will be rather difficult for the stock market to trade on the potential for good news long enough for the good news to hit. Therefore, it is quite likely this could be the final equity market blow-off, however far it may go, sort of matching the bond blow-off of last summer. There is some precedent for just this sort of stock market action, as something similar occurred right after Ronald Reagan was elected. I touched on this yesterday (and please dont send me any emails telling me Trump is not Reagan, I totally understand that), i.e., that we have a potential sea-change in psychology from a very negative macro outlook for the U.S. economy to one that is expected to be better. Again, that doesnt necessarily translate to higher equity prices, due to the impact of rising rates on the current level of valuations to consider. Nonetheless, after Reagan was elected there was about a two-week 10% rally in the S&P, which then reversed and a substantial decline ensued. I believe if and when the stock market rally finally is perceived to have ended we could see a lot of destruction very fast, given the brittle structure that I have talked about ad nauseam. And of course a reversal in the stock market would probably impact the dollar (and metals) and we might even get a kneejerk reaction in bonds. Taking Some You Time Nearly all markets are currently in motion, so it is best to step back, try to figure out what is really going on, think about what you are looking for that would cause you to change any positions you have, but avoid taking any action unless you are fairly certain about what is happening and why. Beneath the surface of the stock market one can see that tech is being sold (that sector, especially FANG, has the highest multiples and therefore is the most vulnerable to a change in the bond market, plus a strong dollar hurts them), while Trump plays are being purchased. I dont see how the market can readjust itself and really hold together because I dont think there will be enough buyers of tech to accommodate the sellers, and thus the market overall could easily come under pressure fairly soon, but we will just have to see how that plays out. WallStreet.com Basically, while were in this period of quasi euphoria, the market for the moment is a concept stock, like biotech, and concept stocks dont generally bother having fundamentals, nor do people worry about them until they do, and then they decline drastically as a consequence of basically being binary. With all of that out of the way I will turn to the action. Overnight the SPOOs were about 0.75% higher and the market itself was higher in the early going. We then got a quick reversal both lower then back higher, at least for the Dow (the S&P was up fractionally). The Nasdaq, however, kept leaking. By days end the former added over 1% while the latter lost 0.75%. Away from stocks, the euphoria playbook was in use and all the outside markets were very volatile, with green paper quite strong, while oil lost 1% and bonds were initially strong, then were beat up again. The 10-year lost another 8 basis points, as yields have now risen from 1.50% to 2.12% in five weeks. Precious metals gave up an overnight rally and were lower. Part of that was exacerbated by Stan Druckenmiller, who said hed sold his gold into the election-night rally (I have covered that all in Ask Fleck). After going negative silver climbed back into positive territory, gaining 0.3%, while gold lost 1.5%. Included below are six questions and answers from the Q&As with Bill Fleckenstein. Bonus Q&A Question: Hi Fleck  Hope all is well and you are enjoying the interesting times we live in now. Forget Trump   lets talk about the Indian PM who has overnight banned large currency notes and is forcing people to deposit them in lieu of newer notes. I feel that this will help to thwart black money (nearly $2 Trillion) and terrorist activities (fake notes etc.) and will also curb real estate prices. But this could change how people view Gold even more. I suspect many Indians now are conducting transactions in Gold (or Crypto currencies such as Bitcoin) which could elevate Gold demand. Import of gold in the form of coins and medallions is prohibited. Ah well, another interesting bit of info in the ever changing times we live in. Narendra Modi Bans Indias Largest Currency Bills in Bid to Cut Corruption Enjoy Answer from Fleck:  I suspect this will boost gold demand, after the initial shakeout in a scramble for cash by real estate guys. How can anyone trust the government at all after this? Question: Fleck, I find it odd that SLV has not broken its Tuesday low, 11-8-16, while GLD has. Makes me believe that the down move in GLD is just noise unless, or until, SLV closes below the Nov. 8th low. Is this how you analyze price movement in the precious metals complex; that is, waiting for all assets to show a confirmation in movement? Thanks Answer from Fleck:  Silver is benefitting from being an industrial metal, too. That is part of the concept that is working right now. Question: Hey Bill, 1. In theory Trump should be good for main street and I am wondering if this will cause inflation to tick higher? My inclination is that it will. 2. In the overnight Gold futures market it seems to be trading strong and then loses that strength when the U.S. opens. My guess is that more spec. longs are unwinding and this should bring open interest down to a more normal level. I know you dont regard the COT data as too meaningful but if Gold holds above $1,200 while spec. long open interest declines, would this be a good set up for the next leg higher? Thanks! Answer from Fleck:  1. Yes, plus psychology is changing. 2. There are many scenarios that could be positive, not just yours. Druckenmiller Sells His Gold Question: As far as I know Soros does trade his positions whereas Druckenmiller keeps his positions for some time. What do you make of Stan selling all his gold? [Speaking to CNBC this morning, fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller  who had been pessimistic about the U.S. economy, said that he is now quite, quite optimistic on the U.S. economy following the election of President-elect Donald Trump. Its as hopeful as Ive been in a long time. I sold all my gold on the night of the election. Why? All the reasons I owned it for the last couple of years seem to be ending, namely, expectations that inflation is now set to spike, forcing money out of safe assets  like gold and Treasurys  and into the dollar.] Answer from Fleck:  Druck is a trader and investor. Please see the other post on this topic. Question: In India the gold prices have doubled in few cities due to the currency note issue. Wall Street and the moron Drunkenmiller does not have a clue. Chinese demand will also accelerate due to yuan fall. Gold demand is spiking up in Asia all over. Out of touch Wall Street can control the gold prices only for few days. If this continues I will load up gold bars here in America to sell in India and rest of the Asia. There are enough rich people in India who want gold. Maybe Stan should sell any coins left over to me. Answer from Fleck:  You make worthwhile points about demand, but in the short run they can be trumped by the herd for a little while. Question: Interesting .I dont recall gold miners caring a hoot when Druckenmiller declared that he was long gold. Now that he says hes out (of gold), they obediently pay attention??? Answer from Fleck:  LOL, for this five minutes. *** To subscribe to Bill Fleckensteins fascinating Daily Thoughts CLICK HERE. ***ALSO JUST RELEASED: If You Are Worried About The Action In The Gold Market, Just Read This  CLICK HERE.  2015 by .

November 22 (  )  Overnight bond markets enjoyed a nice bounce, with the exception of Japan, while equity markets followed bonds. Here in America, the early going saw the indices modestly higher  IMPORTANT: To find out which company the richest man in China has invested in, one that Rick Rule and Sprott Asset Management are pounding the table on that is quickly being recognized as one of the greatest investment opportunities in the world  CLICK HERE OR BELOW: Sponsored Over the course of the day the market drifted sort of sideways and was just modestly higher with an hour to go, when I had to leave. Away from stocks, green paper was slightly higher, oil was flat, and fixed bounced while the metals were mixed, with silver a couple of pennies higher and gold a little lower. Still Voting (With Their Wallets) It has now been a couple of weeks since the election and the major indices have all hit new highs. However, I am trying not to draw any definitive conclusions until we learn more about who is going to populate the Trump administration and exactly what they plan to try to accomplish. That said, no matter who they pick I expect there is going to be a fair amount of friction. I also want to give the equity market some time to finish its somewhat emotional reaction to the election. I say emotional because, when looking back at what occurred in 1980, obviously emotion and optimism trumped the facts for some space of time, but it eventually took a couple of years of pain before real positives outweighed the negatives. We have a much, much worse hand to play now, although that is not to say we cant all be better off in a couple of years from an economic standpoint  and that has to be the hope of everyone. Nevertheless, I continue to believe that all of this semi-euphoria is a head-fake, although I think the bond markets are definitely right to finally stop discounting deflation and start the process of discounting inflation. Included below are three questions and answers from the Q&As with Bill Fleckenstein. Bonus Q&A Question: Hi Bill, Traders question: over the next 3 months, what offers more upside, the metals or the miners? Thank you Answer from Fleck:  Miners, IMO. Will India Ban Gold Imports? Question: Rumor has it that India is about to ban imports of gold. What do you think the chances are that this will really occur? And if so, how negative would it be for the price of gold? Answer from Fleck:  Zero. And quite negative. Question: Hi Bill, In your recent daily rap, you indicated that the stock market is on borrowed time. In the background of rising usd, are you confident that gold and silver will rise as a result the upcoming market correction. I thought in February that a weak dollar factored into the spectacular growth of miners. Answer from Fleck:  If stocks decline for real, the dollar probably will as well. There are many factors at work at all times, and it is easy to pick one and say that it is THE variable. Thus, what happened early in the year was a function of more than just a weak spot for the dollar. *** To subscribe to Bill Fleckensteins fascinating Daily Thoughts CLICK HERE.

 https://www./lrc-blog/epic-deep-state-internecine-division/ I believe in these final climatic days before November 8, we will see epic Deep State internecine division. Some will publicly surface, most will remain buried sub-strata. The Deep State is not monolithic or homogeneous but is composed of many seemingly disparate elements or competing factions united by their systemic base criminality under the phony rubric of national security. Administrations change, but the Deep State endures. I think the overall standard perception of Trump as viewed as an outlier or dangerous loose cannon to the statist old guard elites who see his enormous ego, hubris, and independence of mind as threatening to their rackets is breaking down and being challenged late in the game by some factions. Raison dtat, institutional loyalty and self-interest trumps everything else. The Clinton ties to epic criminality and predation are thoroughly documented but under-reported by the regime media in thrall to their Deep State suzerains up to this point. She is now being deemed expendable by some elements. And like Huma, she will be thrown under the bus. Some of those factions within the Deep State  particularly those un-elected powerful bureaucrats deep within the permanent government and Pentagon that determine actual day-to-day policy from one administration to another, will turn on Hillary, out of amoral self-interest and institutional loyalty. James Comey is perhaps the first and most notable. Prepare for the Night of the Long Knives, version 2016. 3:14 pm on October 30, 2016
 https://www./lrc-blog/trumps-prospects-improve/ Trump shares have gained sharply in the IEM prediction market, rising from under 10 cents to about 29 cents. Ordinary polls also are showing the race tightening. Clinton leads, but the suddenly much higher volatility of prices means that Trumps prospects have improved. Trump released his contract with America 6 days ago. The biased media ignored it. The failures of Obamacare made headlines coincident with Trumps shares rising. Donna Braziles passing debate questions to Clinton is also coincident with Clinton falling and Trump rising. The continuous Wikileaks revelations about Clinton are also coincident with the Trump comeback. My guess is that a good many voters who (naively) respect the integrity of the FBI are dismayed as they learn how Clinton interfered with the investigation and how the FBI was corrupted. (These are voters, and there are many, who think J. Edgar Hoover is a hero and who have never heard of entrapment.) Others are bound to be affected by the huge sums of money handed over to the Clintons where quid pro quos are evident. Charitable giving cannot explain these transfers. Yet others who support the Second Amendment are being solidified against Clinton by revelations that she intends to use executive orders to get her way. Clinton and Trump have taken opposite positions on the integrity of Americas voting methods. Trumps position has been helped by recent complaints of machines that switched votes from one candidate to the opposition. Clintons position has been hurt by (a) her own manipulations during the Democratic primaries, and (b) her attempts to link Trumps position with the bogeyman Russians. Furthermore, Clinton accused him of treason when she said We also know from the former head of our Counterterrorism Center, Matt Olsen, that the kinds of rhetoric and language that Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries. Her extremism in this charge signals her fear of Trumps challenge. It could only cause Trump supporters to close ranks behind him and assure greater voter turnout for him. Clintons many baseless charges and wild exaggerations show yet again her fondness for character assassination and attacks on anyone she perceives as an obstacle to her ambitions. 11:52 am on October 28, 2016
 By  on October 27, 2016 Subscribe Ivana Trump, the first wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, confirmed what many of us have been thinking for a long time now: Trump is a childish buffoon. Her story of a young Donald Trump on the ski slopes is telling of the temperament we see in the nominee now. Ivana Trump: He Could Not Take It Trump biographer Michael DAntonio spoke with Ivana Trump about her marriage to The Donald, and she remembered a time he took her skiing. This was early on, before they married, and one would think Donald would want to show his best side, right? No. You see, Ivana neglected to tell the young Donald Trump that she was a very accomplished skier. According to Ivana Trump, Donald skied down the slope first, and then:   He goes and stops, and he says, Come on, baby. Come on, baby. I went up. I went two flips up in the air, two flips in front of him. I disappeared. Donald was so angry, he took off his skis, his ski boots, and walked up to the restaurant. He could not take it. He could not take it. She said he stormed off, saying: Im not going to do this for anybody, including Ivana. We all know by now that Donald Trump is a man who doesnt like to lose. Ever. He is a man easily baited, easily goaded, and he has the temper of a petulant child. His outbursts have sparked the hashtag #trumpertantrum . Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was correct when she said, in her speech at the Democratic National Convention: A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. Nor is a man who storms off in a huff when bested by his girlfriend on the ski slopes. Donald Trump: I Loved To Fight DAntonio also said that Donald told him how he loved a good fight. I loved to fight. I always loved to fight. All types of fights. Any kind of fight, I loved it, including physical. Theres a word for people who act like that: Bully. Of course, Trump has put his childish, bullying ways on display for the world during this election cycle. Ivana just happened to be one of his earlier victims. Watch their appearance on Oprah in 1988, when Trump said she does what he tells her to do: Carrie is a progressive mom and wife living in the upper Midwest. Connect
 Posted on October 31, 2016 by  in Politics Share This A womans Halloween costume is going viral after she snapped a quick picture and posted it to Twitter. Although a few panties were in a wad because she dressed as Hillary Clinton wearing a prison jumpsuit, liberals just about went into full meltdown after seeing what was behind her. The image was actually seen on the social media account of The Blaze reporter and famed conservative commentator Tomi Lahren  after she shared one of her videos from Facebook. As it turns out, one of her subscribers had a picture that made for the perfect response. As can be seen, a woman decided to dress up as Hillary Clinton in a prison jumpsuit  but thats far from the complete picture.  Mr. Cards (@MrCards007) October 21, 2016 Hitting her point home, it seems as though the womans significant other decided to dress up as Donald Trump, who was actually hauling Hillary Clinton off to jail. The visual created reflects Mr. Trumps promise given during the second debate when he said that he would put her in jail. Of course, others seemed to have loved the idea so much that they decided to duplicate the idea while putting their own spin on things: so my parents dressed up as trump & Hillary for prison for the costume party  pic.twitter.com/9RVAx4834z  Faith Sampson (@Faithh Sampsonn) October 29, 2016 Even a few kids got involved with the Halloween costume idea: Happy Halloween ! Donald J. Trump (@P0TUSTrump) October 31, 2016 With everything thats come out during the recent days, theres only one place that Hillary Clinton deserves to be. Between compromising the security of the American people through the use of her illegal email server to whoring out our country to fill her pockets, there isnt a single person who can argue that this woman is a criminal. Fortunately, it seems that FBI Director James Comey recently found his backbone and decided to actually start holding Hillary accountable. Lets just hope Trump wins this election by a landslide and can follow through with that promise to lock Hillary away once and for all.
Share This Adam Aliev had a sex change operation before marrying his male lover. However, after his brutal murder by an anti-LGBT bigot, dont expect to hear a peep from the liberal media. A young transgender, who recently had surgery to become a woman, was found brutally hacked to pieces and completely unrecognizable at a gruesome murder scene. However, as soon as the liberal media found out the identity of the suspected killer, they fell eerily silent about the major news story theyd otherwise blast across the airwaves. The liberal agenda is clear  propagate everything that promotes their progressive ideals. However, when it comes to Islam, the left has an incredibly difficult time defending its teachings since they almost always oppose liberal values. Once again, the left has proven that ratings and the already soiled reputation of their favorite religion are more important than even their own beliefs. From a young age, Adam Aliev believed he was meant to be female. Unfortunately, his family was not supportive of his decision to live as a woman, to say the least, but this only empowered Aliev to undergo a sex change operation and take the name Raina. Sadly, shortly after 25-year-old Aliev made the transformation and married his male lover, he was brutally murdered for his lifestyle. While all of this fits the liberal dream of pushing a victimized LGBT poster children in an attempt to demonize conservatives, the leftist media wont be flooding social media with Alievs face for one crucial reason. Naira Naija News reports that not only is Alievs disapproving family made up of devout Muslims, his father is also suspected of being responsible for his sons heinous murder. Aliev was reportedly butchered and hacked into pieces just after his father Alimshaikh Aliev rallied other devout Muslims on live television to honor kill his transgender son. Let him be killed, I dont want to see him. Bring him here and kill him in front of my eyes, the father ordered. Alievs passport shows him before his surgical transformation, the final straw that prompted his Muslim family to demand his gruesome murder. Shortly after the broadcast, police confirmed that Aliev was cut up into pieces and unrecognizable to those who knew him. I did not recognize Adams cut-up body when it was brought to the village, an official said. Aliev was born into a Muslim Chechen family in Dagestan, a Muslim-dominated area in the Russian Trans-Caucasus. According to Alimshaikh, his sons decision to live as a woman and marry a man had apostatized him from Islam, which the Quran teaches is worthy of execution. Although it is unclear whether Alimshaikh is an actual murder suspect, he is undeniably responsible for bringing about his sons death, which could and should result in criminals charges. According to Daily Mail , Alievs mother was reported to be crying day and night after she heard about his sex change and un-Islamic wedding. It was then that the father publically broadcasted a purman, which is an invitation for Muslims to kill a particular person. He cheated them, he went there to Moscow, had surgery and he turned from a boy to a girl, said a female neighbor of the victims father. And now in Chechnya it is known too. His mother is saying I dont want to see him, I gave birth to a son, but what for? It is such a disgrace for the family. If the mother and father give a purman, it means they want him to be killed. Muslims are responsible for 91 percent of the worlds honor killings, which have motives ranging from marrying against their familys wishes to simply insulting Islam by becoming too Western. In fact, even the familys Muslim neighbor believes that Alievs actions are so dishonorable that they warranted his death. Mad World News reported in December 2015 that a 23-year-old Muslim woman brutally drowned her 2-year-old daughter after she caught her own father raping the child. The little girl suffered severe internal injuries before the mother walked in on the girls 59-year-old grandfather sexually abusing her. The woman drew her still bleeding daughter a bath and held her underwater until she stopped breathing because she wanted to avoid scandal. This is just one example of the sinister measures Muslim will go to in order to preserve their religions idea of honor. While the left claims to be the champion of LGBT rights, dont expect them to make a fuss over Alievs death. As they have consistently proven, Islam trumps the LGBT community. Either because they are terrified of Muslims or because they are blindly ignorant of the ideology, liberals will likely come to the defense of Islam over its transgender victim.
Corrente. Days Until: -3. Comment on polling: Election calls have never seemed very interesting to me  were it my place to make them  in the same way that predicting when a flood will crest is a lot less interesting than understanding (and perhaps managing) a watershed. That doesnt mean predictions are not fun! Madison asked in the Federalist 51 : But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? By the same token: What is the horse race, but the greatest of all the performing arts? That said, putting past Water Coolers into the call frame, the method I used didnt yield bad results. Rather than tracking the very noisy individual polls, I decided to use the RealClearPolitics polling averages every Monday  once a week, for sanitys sake  and plug those averages into a reasonable list of swing states provided by the New York Times, whose interactive tool then enabled me to game out scenarios in the electoral college. In all the weeks I did this but one, Trump had a plausible path to victory, depending on reasonable scenarios in individual states. In other words, still in the call frame, I beat most of the paid pollsters in the political class who were, er, trumpeting Clintons victory. And as we saw in yesterdays Water Cooler, I tied the Trump teams internal polling; they thought they were going to lose, though they qualified their views by pointing out the same plausible paths to victory that I did. Why did I not get the scale of Trumps victory? I mean, in 2008 and 2012, and maybe farther back, the Republican candiate always made a show of putting Pennsylvania in play, and it never came to anything. Trump won it! Along with Michigan and Wisconsin (where Sanders, interestingly, defeated Clinton as well). It is clear to any objective observer that the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which has resulted in rapidly rising premiums and deductibles, narrow networks, and health insurance, has not been a success. A Trump Administration will work with Congress to repeal the ACA and replace it with a solution that includes Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and returns the historic role in regulating health insurance to the States. The Administrations goal will be to create a patient-centered healthcare system that promotes choice, quality and affordability with health insurance and healthcare, and take any needed action to alleviate the burdens imposed on American families and businesses by the law [ President Elect ]. Let us know how that works out. And: To maximize choice and create a dynamic market for health insurance, the Administration will work with Congress to enable people to purchase insurance across state lines. The Administration also will work with both Congress and the States to re-establish high-risk pools  a proven approach to ensuring access to health insurance coverage for individuals who have significant medical expenses and who have not maintained continuous coverage. And: Modernize Medicare, so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation  and beyond Maximize flexibility for States in administering Medicaid, to enable States to experiment with innovative methods to deliver healthcare to our low-income citizens Hmm. Donald Trump has said he wants to repeal Obamacare, and we hope that wasnt an empty campaign promise, said Twila Brase, president and co-founder of CCHF. It will take more than a promise to make American health care great again and to restore health care freedom to patients and doctors. Republicans need to advance visionary ideas for health care, ideas that are bigger than buying across state lines; ideas that put patients and doctors back together again without the costly interference and intrusions of profiteering outsiders. The high cost of health care comes primarily from the middlemen, including managed care and government' [ Citizens Council for Health Freedom ]. CCHF is a good conservative site on health care policy. I dont agree with them on policy, but CCHF is relentless and above all they dont make stuff up. Obamacare Replacement Might Look Familiar [ Kaiser Health News ]. Could be. ObamaCare was, after all, originally a Republican plan, so it should be possible to rebrand it. It gets into a questions of semantics, said Mark Rouck, an insurance analyst for Fitch Ratings. Are they really repealing the act if they replace it with new legislation that has some of the same characteristics?  Topping the list of ACA provisions likely to survive under Trump is the requirement that employers cover workers children up to the age of 26, analysts said. The measure is widely popular and not especially expensive . A health law crafted by Republicans might also retain the ACAs protections for people with preexisting illness seeking coverage, said Glenn Melnick, a health economist at the University of Southern California  The ACAs biggest coverage expansion came through the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, which added more than 15 million people. Trump has suggested giving states fixed federal grants for Medicaid, which could lead to a substantial reduction in coverage or benefits. Then Donald Trump was elected president, and now the tables may have turned again. Trump has on several occasions expressed his opposition to net neutrality, once calling it another top down power grab [ MarketWatch ]. Whos Advising President-elect Trump on Heatlh Care?

And: Names reportedly under consideration for HHS secretary include former Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Gov. Rick Scott, R-Florida, and former Rep. Renee Ellmers R-North Carolina. Thin bench! One day after his election, we polled our readership of healthcare managers and clinicians to see what they think the short and long-term effects will be of Trumps policies on the healthcare sector, and we were flooded with responses. While most of them detail the deep concerns industry professionals have, a small few felt the businessmans idea could improve competition and lower costs [ Health Care FInance ]. Good article. At this early stage, we cant know with certainty exactly why Clinton lost. In a narrow sense, obviously, the electoral vote was lost because she lost Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Iowa. Exit polls (which are often unreliable, but all we have for the moment) and the vote distribution strongly suggest those states were lost because Clinton lost many of the white working-class voters that broke for Obama in 2012 . Overall exits show a 16-point swing to Trump among voters making less than $30,000 compared to the last presidential election  the biggest of any group in The New York Times crosstabs . Also, general turnout was off from 2012  [ The Week ]. So to fire the blame cannons at working class racism, you have to argue like this: Trump won the racist vote because the people who voted for the black guy wouldnt vote for the white woman. Oh, OK. Now, you can deploy the misogyny blame cannons, but the identity politicians seem to be going with racism at the moment. People often talk about racism/sexism/xenophobia vs. economic suffering as if they are totally distinct dichotomies. Of course there are substantial elements of both in Trumps voting base, but the two categories are inextricably linked: The more economic suffering people endure, the angrier and more bitter they get, the easier it is to direct their anger to scapegoats. Economic suffering often fuels ugly bigotry [Glenn Greenwald, The Intercept ]. I would go further and urge that racism/sexism/xenophobia are forms of politics, and that they are the evil twin of identity politics, and together are the only forms of politics permitted by elites . See the next link. A top liberal group [The Center for American Progress] has temporarily abandoned plans for a new project designed to court white working class voters after it could not marshal the necessary financial support for the project, according to documents obtained by the Washington Free Beacon [Washington Free Beacon (2014)]. So, the Democrats abandoned the (white) working class because the squillionaires wouldnt fund the effort to reach out to them (and here we are!) Could it be that the squillionaires had a reason for that? Like that would be against their class interests? More: The stated need for the project suggests potential pitfalls for Democrats in its eventual delay: In a midterm election year expected to heavily favor Republicans, CAP has apparently abandoned, for the time being, an effort to reach out to a constituency that it acknowledges could determine the viability of the Democrats voting coalition going forward. The Bobby Kennedy Project was the brainchild of CAP senior fellow Ruy Teixeira, who for the past decade has stressed that a lasting Democratic majority will require the party to make inroads with white working class voters. Much too little, much too late from Teixeira, who injected the identity politics virus into the Democrat bloodstream to begin with . The Dems need organization and focus on the young. Need a fifty State strategy and tech rehab. I am in for chairman again, Dean said [ Yahoo News ]. Oh, HoHo. Really? After helping Clinton rig her selection as a superdelegate and smearing Trump as a coke user on no evidence ? Yeah, the 50-state strategy was great. But that was before you lost your mind!

Mark Ames via e-mail: What we learned even in the 90sthere are never, ever any standards for a journalist writing about Russia. Ever. The more bigoted and fantastical, the better. And when your hack crap is completely 100% debunked by other revelations, no editor will ever, ever discipline you. The only way you can have problems with Russia journalism is if you step away from the herd. No editor will ever forgive you for it. And John Helmer debunked it more specifically by e-mail. Since his message was long, some key bits: My wife is linked to Putin  shes Russian. Im linked to Putin  his friend Oleg Deripaska tried to kill me. Fridman is busy exiting from Russia as fast as he can go  and may lose Vimpelcom Russia in consequence. The recent DoJ corruption penalty for Vimpelcom  $795M  indicates a reasonable lack of fondness on his part for the current US administration, but then Fridman has hired Richard Burt (Reagan-Bush) and Tom McLarty (Clinton) to advise  meaning lobby for him to get approvals from the Treasury, State and CIA for takeovers of fresh US assets, such as FreedomPop. And they are going through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, so the Trump connection cant be as bad as the Clintonites make out. Burt and McLarty are advisors to the LetterOne board, not directors on the Alfa Bank board. If Burt is considered a Trump man  e.g., , http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-campaign-lobbyist-russian-pipeline-229264  how to explain he was vintage Reagan and Bush?

Outsourcing this again to Ames who has seen more of this than I have: The super-secret server linkup is one of the most inane supermarket spy pulp fantasies Ive seen. Its cartoon-bad. Most conspiracy theorists work a lot harder on their inane inventions than this. It relies on total ignorance, on a cartoonish grasp of how linkups would work.

Donald Trump Used Legally Dubious Method to Avoid Paying Taxes New York Times. Par for the course for the New York Times. Article hyperventilates about supposedly improper behavior by Trump, yet the basis for the case is that what he did was later made impermissible. I deducted interest I paid on my one little student loan in the early 1980s because prior to the 1986 Tax Reform Act, all consumer interest was tax deductible. By the standards of the Times fulminating, what I did then was similarly legally dubious. Help me. On top of that, from what I infer from this piece, which is not at all clear on what Trump supposedly did (it tries to make his sin about failure to report, which sounds like a stretch; the IRS does have audit powers), it still appears that Lee Sheppards analysis of why what Trump did in 1995 was kosher then but not kosher later is the best account to date. And that was out a full month ago. Her article specifically discussed why the cancellation of debt income did not appear on his tax return at the time. I am putting the key part of her discussion (it was unpaywalled for weeks but now Tax Analysts has hidden it again) at the very end of this post so the geeky can see what a stretch the Times treatment is.
What Does Trumps Victory Mean For NATO? NPR. Charles flags the close, which is an unusually pointed admission of the basis of our imperialist project. Brexit Turkey is swiftly heading towards a regime of terror Bangkok Post (furzy) Trump Transition. I am trying, and hope you will help in comments, in pulling the noise out of the signal regarding what Trump will actually do when he becomes President and whether it will succeed, success consisting first of it being implemented and second, making him and his Administration appear to be legitimate (as in keeping campaign promises, delivering tangible benefits to voters or powerful interest groups he needs on board). Despite all the changes in messaging over the course of his campaign, Trump was consistent on immigration, trade and lack of infrastructure investment, and depicted all three as ways to improve conditions for workers. And political scientist Tom Ferguson says that the data shows that the propensity to vote for Trump was highly correlated with voters giving negative answers to questions like whether the economy or the job situation had gotten better. Trump and Sanders found power lying in the street by virtue of both parities abandoning high employment levels and wage growth as major policy goals. But if Trump is to deliver on his promise of delivering on those goals, he is at odds with much of his own party, which is keen to keep workers weak and preserve free trade (the corporate Republicans, particularly ones whose constituents include globalized businesses like autos, for the obvious patronage reasons; libertarians, out of ideology). Given that trade policy and immigration enforcement are areas in which the President has considerable latitude, whether and how he engages in these fights will be early tests of whether he intends to and is able to execute. Finally bear in mind that Trump not only has a thin bench staff wise, but also intellectually. Many of his sources of advice are ideologues who like the Brexiters in the UK, may cheerily recommend changes which might sound ducky (to them) without having the foggiest clue that the operational implications are nightmarish. For instance, Im told the Trump transition team on policy is apparently planning on recommending that the US exit Nafta and the WTO on the first day of the Trump presidency. Pray tell, have they looked into what this means for US customs, and for US exporters dealing with foreign customs? In other words, the right wing think tank types that the Trump team is relying on runs the risk of being as clueless about issues of organizational capacity as the Greeks were who thought they had a trump card (pun intended) in a Grexit (for those new to Naked Capitalism, we had an extensive series of posts on this topic, see here , here and here for some examples). So for instance, see this BBC story: Trump likes main Obamacare provisions very much , specifically, covering pre-existing conditions and letting children up to age 26. The story describes how the Republicans might oppose Trump: Complicating the matter is that a revise and reform effort may not fly with Mr Trumps ardent supporters and the cadre of arch-conservative politicians in Congress, who want to tear up the law root and branch. Mr Trump often broke with Republican orthodoxy while campaigning and didnt pay a political price. He may learn that as president he wont get far without his party establishments help. In WSJ Interview, Trump Says He Is Willing to Keep Parts of Health Law Wall Street Journal. Note the heavy emphasis on job creation. This had been the Democratic party lode star through the Carter era. He also defines Pences job, which is to help on health care and sell Trump policies to Congress. This is similar to the role Joe Biden played. And he rejected the Administration find those moderate Syrians strategy.
Whats that spell? Whats that spell? Schadenfreude!! Schadenfreude! Whats that spell? Schadenfreude!!! [cheers]. The Democrat establishment was warned about their weak candidate, and they were presented with a popular and well-funded alternative: Bernie Sanders. Instead, as the Podesta emails show in lavish detail, they used their control of the party machinery and their service providers in our famously free press to rig the election in their favor at every turn. When their candidate was nominated, the Democrat establishment tacked right, and proceeded to explain to Sanders voters that their voters were not needed because, as #BernieBros, they were racist and sexist. Sanders supporters have every right to say #WeWereRight and #WeToldYouSo. If this were Japan, wed be seeing Democrat Party leaders committing seppuku, or cutting off their little fingers or  supposing them not to be gangsters  ritually and tearfully bowing to the people they betrayed. This being America, and these being Democrats, they are feverishly deploying the Blame Cannons at racist and sexist #BernieBros, Johnson, Stein, and the dogs who wouldnt eat the dog food. These assclowns will only leave office if theyre whipped with scorpions. So get to it, Sanders supporters. This is your time. MBA Mortgage Applications, week of November 4, 2016: Purchase applications for home mortgages rose a seasonally adjusted 1 percent in the November 4 week as activity by home buyers stabilizes following a decline to the lowest level since January in the previous weeks [ Econoday ]. Wholesale Trade, September 2016: Inventories at the wholesale level rose 0.1 percent in September vs a revised 0.1 percent decline in August: [ Econoday ]. In a special positive, wholesale inventories of autos fell 1.7 percent in a draw, based on last weeks very strong results for October vehicle sales, that will have to be rebuilt. The risk that inventories may be too high are a key concern for the economic outlook, specifically that high levels of unwanted inventories could slow fourth-quarter production and employment growth. Wages: The Atlanta Feds Wage Growth Tracker came in at 3.6 percent in September, up from 3.3 percent in August and 3.4 percent in July, but the same as the 3.6 percent reading for June. By this measure, there are no obvious signs of an acceleration in wage growth for continuously employed workers during the last few months [ Econintersect ]. However, the headline wage growth tracker is a three month moving average of each months median wage growth. Interestingly, for September, the median wage growth (using data that are not averaged, sometimes called unsmoothed) was 4.2 percent, up from 3.6 percent in August, and the highest since late 2007.

Trucking companies are preparing to meet a Dec. 31, 2017 deadline to equip all trucks with electronic logging devices measuring their hours on the road.

Growth has been even weaker for non-oil imports, which have increased at an average annual rate of only 0.1 percent. This is in sharp contrast to the pattern in the five quarters preceding the second quarter of 2015, when real non-oil imports were growing at an annualized rate of 8 percent per quarter [ Liberty Stree t]. How has the recent slowdown in U.S. investment affected U.S. imports? The next chart shows that U.S. capital goods imports are very highly correlated with equipment investmenta category that excludes intangibles, residential investment, and changes in inventories. Equipment investment has been unusually weak, with its four-quarter percentage change falling into negative territory, which is unusual outside a recession period. These data suggest that the slowdown in import growth likely stems from whatever is behind the weakness in equipment, rather than from trade-specific factors such as trade policies or higher trade costs.

Notice the flaccidity of the language: democratic norms; all manner of; a fact  that will lead to. Remnik really needs an editor. Sad. Homeless in America [Thomas Friedman, New York Times ]. How do I explain Trumps victory? Way too soon to say for sure, but my gut tells me that it has much less to do with trade or income gaps and much more to do with culture and many Americans feeling of homelessness.' And then Friedman spirals off into abstractions about the feelings people have when they lose their homes, while somehow omitting to mention the fact that millions of Americans literally lost their homes in a foreclosure crisis caused by scamming banksters Obama never brought to justice, and who, if they were foolish enough to enter Obamas foam the runway HAMP program, were further screwed. Americans are not and have never been united by blood or creed, but by allegiance to a democratic system of government that shares power, cherishes the rule of law and respects the dignity of individuals. We hope our newly elected president will show respect for that system. Americans must stand ready to support him if he does, and to support the system whether he does or does not [Editorial Board, WaPo ]. Would that any of those things were true. Perhaps for the individuals on WaPos editorial board, they are. Political scientists have long recognized that most ordinary citizens have only a tenuous grasp of the presuppositions and complex obligations of democracy, the rights it grants and the self-restraints it imposes. Thus, political elites serve as the major repositories of the public conscience, if anyone does [Larry Bartels, New York Times ]. Ive always wondered why the Democrats never really work to extent the franchise. Here at least we have the ideological justification. Today the world has seen the end of two centuries of Anglo-Saxon dominance  a hundred years of Britain, from the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 to the Battle of the Somme, and a hundred years of the United States, ending today, with the election as president of the US of a fascist television personality married to a nude model [ Splash 247 ]. Decadence is the term that we need, here  decadence on a scale not seen in the world since the fall of the Roman Empire  which fell in much the same way, for much the same reasons. We have now seen a hat trick of democratic events in which men who come from the elite, and who have betrayed their class  Roderigo Duterte, in the Philippines, on May 9, was the straw in the wind, he was followed by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage in the UK, on June 23, and today by Donald Trump in the US, and they have, with the use of the internet social media, most especially Mark Zuckerbergs Facebook, successfully suckered the soggy mass of lazy, ill-educated, ill-read and ill-informed proles, and a good supply of what V.I. Lenin called useful idiots, in three nations, into putting them into power, by telling lies and by promising the proles what they want. What the proles want is good jobs but with the ability to buy the stuff they buy now at cheap prices, because it is made by under paid, hardworking, men and women in other countries who have stolen their jobs, and they want no foreigners. They cant have this, of course, but no matter, they dont read, they just look at memes, and the damage is done. Leave it to the Brits to work in the class angle, quote Lenin, and toss in an Orwell reference! Trump voters will not like what happens next [Garrison Keillor, WaPo ]. America is still the land where the waitress kids can grow up to become physicists and novelists and pediatricians, but it helps a lot if the waitress and her husband encourage good habits and the ambition to use your God-given talents and the kids arent plugged into electronics day and night. Help me. Americans have done a very dangerous thing this week. Because of what they have done we all face dark, uncertain and fearful times [ Guardian ]. Dear God, America what have you done?: How the world and its media reacted as Donald Trump became US President-elect [ Telegraph ]. A nice round-up of front page images. Trump won largely because people couldnt bring themselves to vote for Clinton, and not so much because anyone like him or his presumed agenda. And along the way he destroyed the Republican party, which may or may not sit so well with Republicans in Congress [ Mosler Economics] . So its not like he has a mandate to do anything or that he can rely on Republican support for anything. Im not so sure; I see the Republican primary and the general taken together a repudiation of both party establishments and the political class in its totality. That said, this is important: Regarding his proposed tax cuts, under current law bills cant be introduced in Congress unless they are paid for, so, for example, to introduce a tax cut it has to be paid for by spending cuts. Yes, Congress could change the law or override it but that would require Senate approval, and that takes a 60% majority that Republicans dont have. So my point is that at best its going to take a very long time to get anything done. And the way all the charts are decelerating it could all get pretty ugly waiting for the kind of fiscal adjustment needed to reverse course. The new Senates Republican majority will remain short of the 60 votes needed for a full repeal. But Congress demonstrated in the past year that it could use the upper chambers reconciliation process  requiring just 50 votes  to send a bill undoing major ACA elements to the White House. Last winter, President Obama vetoed that legislation [ WaPo ]. Meaning, of course, that the Democrats could have done exactly the same thing in 2009, but passed HR676 or SB703. That, throwing a bankster or two in jail, and a decent stimulus package instead of the one Larry Summers deked Obama into approving, and the Democrats might control all three branches of government today. And so it goes. As of 11:55 a.m. ET, Clinton had amassed 59,458,295 votes nationally, to Trumps 59,265,380  a margin of 192,915 that puts Clinton on track to become the fifth U.S. presidential candidate to win the popular vote but lose the election [ NPR ].

NTEB Ads Privacy Policy  There are so who ignorantly assert that the doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church was "unknown before John Nelson Darby taught it". I say "ignorant" because people make comments like these seemingly unaware that there are recorded accounts of it being taught all the way back to the 4th century AD. by  November 21, 2016 The doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture appears over and over again, in both Old and New Testaments. Take Enoch for example. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord. 1 Thessalonians 4:16,17 (KJV) For a reason that eludes me , the Bible doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church of Jesus Christ is a highly-despised subject in these Laodicean times we find ourselves in. Perhaps one of the reasons why it is so hated is because so many preachers stopped preaching on it years ago, because the idea of trying to live your life with a daily expectation of Jesus return is unpalatable to so many. Yet, the doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture appears over and over again, in both Old and New Testaments. Take Enoch for example. And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years: And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him. Genesis 5:23,24 (KJV) Enoch is a type of the gentile believer raptured out before the time of Jacobs trouble Who was Enoch? Glad you asked, Enoch was a gentile believer and follower of God. The Bible says that Enochs walk with the Lord was a really good one, and one day out of the clear blue, God raptured old Enoch up and out of this world, and translated him straight to the throne room of Heaven. Just a few verses later we read about the Flood of Noah, a type of the Great Tribulation which came upon the Earth. Something else about Enoch, he was also a street preacher who preached Jesus to lost people. And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him. Jude 1:14,15 (KJV) So, in type, we see the Pretribulation Rapture and the time of Jacobs trouble happening thousands of years before the coming time when those events will take place in real time, and not just in typology. In the New Testament, the apostle John is taken up to Heaven in yet another type of the Rapture. On the Last Times, the Antichrist, and the End of the World There are so who ignorantly assert that the doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church was unknown before John Nelson Darby taught it. I say ignorant because people make comments like these seemingly unaware that there are recorded accounts of it being taught all the way back to the 4th century AD. A sermon entitled  On the Last Times, the Antichrist, and the End of the World , ascribed to a man by the name of Ephraem Syrus, taught the doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture quite plainly. Here is a snippet from that sermon: For all the saints and elect of God are gathered, prior to the tribulation that is to come, and are taken to the Lord lest they see the confusion that is to overwhelm the world because of our sins That sermon would be the last bit of light from scripture before the Roman Catholic Whore of Babylon would swallow up the Christian Church for over a thousand years. Theres a reason why that period of time used to be taught in schools as the  dark ages , and the time corresponding with the advent of King James Bible in 1611 as the age of enlightenment. So as you can see , God has given types, examples and preaching on the Rapture for thousands of years. Now let us take a quick look at some of the major difference between the Pretribulation Rapture of the Church, and the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. THE SPIRITUAL TEMPERATURE OF THE CHURCH: Jesus says plainly in Revelation 3 that the last version of the Christian Church right before the Rapture is a self-centered, self-focused, lukewarm mess of a Church that locks Jesus on the outside. (Revelation 3:14-22 KJV). This is in stark contrast to Revelation 7 which shows an on-fire dedicated group of believers who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. There will not be anything lukewarm in the time of Jacobs trouble. SATAN STILL FREE TO ROAM AFTER THE RAPTURE: In the first three chapters of Revelation, we plainly see the Church Age. That comes to an end in Revelation 4:1,2 where John, a type of the Church, is taken to Heaven in a type of the Rapture. Match those verses with 1 Corinthians 15:50-57 and 1 Thessalonians 4:15-18 (KJV). No where there do we see Satans reign coming to an end, in fact, we see the appearance of Antichrist just two chapters after the Rapture in Revelation 6:1. Compare that with all the places that mention the Second Coming, which ends in Satan being bound for a thousand years. (Revelation 20:1-4 KJV). JESUS DOESNT LAND AT THE RAPTURE: Paul tells us in both 1 Thessalonians 4 and 1 Corinthians 15, that the Body of Christ is brought UP to meet the Lord in the air in the Rapture. According to Revelation, the Church stays up with the Lord all the way until Revelation 19:14 (KJV). But at the Second Coming, it is all about Him landing on the ground, and bringing His saints with Him . THE RAPTURE BRINGS COMFORT, THE SECOND COMING BRINGS DISTRESS: The apostle Paul, teaching on the Rapture to first century Christians, said that the doctrine of the Pretribulation Rapture was one designed to bring comfort to the hearer. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. 1 Thessalonians 4:18 (KJV) . But not so with the Second Coming/Day of the Lord, not by a l ng shot. Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light. As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it? Amos 5:18-20 (KJV) . If youre looking for comfort there, brother, youre in the wrong place. SECOND COMING PLAINLY TAUGHT WHILE RAPTURE WAS A MYSTERY REVEALED WITH PAUL: In hundreds of places all through the Old Testament, the doctrines of the Second Coming and the Resurrection of the Dead are clearly and plainly taught as doctrine. In Job, the very first book every written, we see that clearly proclaimed. For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: And though after my skin worms destroy this body , yet in my flesh shall I see God: Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. Job 19:25-27 (KJV) . So many of the Old Testament prophets, like Daniel, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Zephaniah, Zechariah and Joel all teach the Second Coming. But though we see types of the Rapture with Enoch and Solomon (Song of Solomon 2:9-12 KJV), the Pretribulation Rapture as teachable doctrine remained a mystery until it was revealed through the apostle Paul. Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, 1 Corinthians 15:51 (KJV) . I love to teach on the Pretribulation Rapture because the evidence for it flows all though the Bible, it couldnt be more clear. So why do so many Christians reject this doctrine? Let me go ask Jesus, Hes currently locked outside His own church at the moment (Revelation 3:20 KJV). But He promises that if I open the door unto Him, He will come in and be happy to show me a few things. Cant see a Pretrib Rapture in the Bible? Maybe its because you got Jesus on the wrong side of the door dont let the Bible correctors and the scholars steal your Blessed Hope. Jesus is coming to get us one Day very soon, as He promised to do. Keep looking up!

 'Nobody said it was going to be easy for us,' Trump declared. 'But we will never be stopped. Never, never be stopped.''I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic. They don't get enough credit. They don't get enough credit. They're amazing people.'   5, 2016 Secret Service agents rushed Donald trump offstage on Saturday evening during a rally in Reno, Nevada after they determined a protester in the audience with a gun posed a threat to the Republican presidential candidate. Go! Go! they shouted as they whisked him away and a combination of local police and private security wrestled the suspect to the ground. Thousands of people scattered like a sea of bodies, screams rang out and authorities dragged the man away as he kicked and strained. Trump returned to the stage just five minutes later. Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, Trump declared. But we will never be stopped. Never, never be stopped. I want to thank the Secret Service. These guys are fantastic. They dont get enough credit. They dont get enough credit. Theyre amazing people. Secret Service Swarms in to Protect Donald Trump After Scare in Reno Trump had spotted the protester and claimed he was a Hillary Clinton supporter before asking security to take him out. As he returned to his speech, Trump thanked a group of fans near the stage who had stepped in to subdue his would-be attacker. You were amazing, fellas, he said. I saw what you were doing. Thats a tough group of people right that  Nobody messes with our people, right? Trump then returned to his regular speech. JUST NOW: Donald Trump was just rushed off stage during his Nevada campaign rally: https://t.co/7fTJ3N3MQN pic.twitter.com/Hm7CRdFDTU  CBS News (@CBSNews) November 6, 2016 Federal agents and tactical officers from Reno Police removed the man and placed him in a bathroom near a secure entrance where Trumps motorcade and the press vehicles were staged. Two audience members told DailyMail.com that they had seen the man holding a firearm. That has not been confirmed by law enforcement. As police and good Samaritans took him down, the crowd surged backward and strained against the press section. CNN sucks! one man yelled. You people caused this! Audience members at the front of the crowd reportedly said they saw the man raise up a sign before a scuffle ensued. Saturdays incident marked the second time Secret Service had to intervene to get Trump out of harms way. In March a man leaped over a police barricade during a Trump rally at an airport hangar in Dayton, Ohio. The man,Thomas Dimassimo, was charged with disorderly conduct and inciting panic, but he never reached the stage. Secret Service tackled him when he was still several yards away from the candidate. I was ready for him, but its much easier if the cops do it, dont we agree? Trump said at the time. And to think I had such an easy life! What do I need this for, right? At this time a motive is not clear. source
That is a great video. Im glad I watched that again. plant this thought lemonhead: Thanks for the video link. The comments for that video also included this link: ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkFJZUIUeEA ), which strongly recommends unground grains over bread products. It may also be the case, that the higher heat of baking is more destructive to the plant chemistry than boiling or pressure cooking. plant this thought Other thoughts: It may be the case, that the higher heat of baking is more destructive to the plant chemistry than boiling or pressure cooking. A particle of freshly ground flour is still enormous compared to a bacterium, but grinding probably increases the surface area accessible to the bugs somewhat, and the seed coat probably slows down penetration, which may be a good thing. Jack Hall The other factor to consider is that the increase in surface area increases exposure to digestive enzymes and degradation by HCL which would increase absorption of nutrients in the small intestine rendering it less useful to bacteria once it has reached the colon. Stewart I would be interested in the the nature of the whole wheat rolls that were used in this study. Very often the difference in white rolls and whole wheat is minimal at best. They also tend to have added oils and frequently milk or whey. A real multi grain bread with higher fiber would likely do much better. Im looking for a good whole grain bread recipe if anyone can share one. lemonhead I used to bake bread, but gave it up a while ago. Ive been thinking about taking it up again and trying sprouted grains. Unfortunately, I dont remember the recipe(s), just that I had to add extra gluten to 100% whole grain dough (and that my current oven sucks). Peter Reinharts books are great, you might find them at your local library. lemonhead Just remembered something  Ive noticed more than one of the centenarians (7th Day Adventists) Ive seen interviewed make their own whole grain bread using freshly ground flour. Maybe theres something to freshly ground flour or homemade whole grain bread, or maybe its the fact that they have a task to do every morning that gets them out of bed and keeps them active. Thea lemonhead: One of my pet theories (nothing to back up that it makes a significant difference) is that home-made freshly ground flour a) will not have had as much time to lose as much nutrients and b) is not likely to be ground up quite as finely as what comes out of professional mills  and for these reasons is healthier. Even if true, I dont know if it is healthier enough to make any kind of significant difference in health outcomes. Its just a pet theory of mine. But I like it  Nick Presidente Most whole wheat rolls are about 60% whole wheat, the rest refined.. they need to keep it soft and fluffy for that selling feature. Unfortunately multigrain buns are worse, with the majority of grain being refined. Ive been attempting a 100% whole grain, no oil or sugar bread. I add ground flax and molasses, with very little salt. The salt makes the rising and over proofing a major concern. Very hard to find a good recipe. Also using a bread machine is limiting, and I dont have the tools right now to mix and bake by hand David J Good point  if the studies did not use intact whole grains, then that alone could be the reason no benefit was found. Also Im wondering if the whole wheat rolls or whatever else was used had emulsifiers in them. Some research on mice has shown that emulsfiers negatively impact gut bacteria. plant this thought Nick: My understanding is that the sugar (or molasses or honey) is only there as food for the yeast (which, of course, makes the bread rise). I wonder if the sugar content could be titrated to an amount that will be completely consumed by the yeast. Blair Rollin 1 cup whole grain spelt flour 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour 1 1/4 cup whole grain rye flour 1/4 cup 7-10 grain cereal 1 tbsp ground flaxseed meal 2 1/4 tsp yeast 2 tsp salt (or whatever you like) 1 tbsp molasses 6 tbsp gluten 1 2/3  1 3/4 cups water I use a bread maker. Knead for 15 minutes then let sit for 20 (turn the machine off and restart it). Then follow the machine cycle for whole wheat bread. You can substitute any other whole grain flour for the rye and it will be excellent, but possibly not as high a loaf. Bobs Red Mill has a big selection of whole grain flours you can try. No preservatives so its only good for a day or so but it freezes perfectly.I have been baking these whole grain breads for over a decade and will not willingly eat any other except whole grain Wasa bread. Once you start eating these fabulous whole grain breads you begin to believe that people can indeed live on bread and water. The refined ingredient is the gluten. You can reduce the amount of gluten but its going to get a lot flatter. (This is one of the very few refined products that I eat, so Im okay with it for the time being.) Thea Blair Rollin: Thanks for taking the time to share a tried and true recipe with us! Im not usually one for making bread, but you have me tempted with this recipe. Blair Rollin I assure you, Im very much in the camp of whole grains are better than whole grain flours. (I guess bread is just another hangover I have from my previous SAD diet.) But I only eat one slice of bread a day usually. The stuff is very handy for making a calorie rich meal (sandwich) that you can eat while youre driving. And its good for sopping up the pot liquor from my red beans and collards. plant this thought No oil in this recipe. Is oil included in standard bread recipes just as a pan lubricant? Is it not required if one uses a non-stick pan? Thea plant this thought: I dont make enough bread to answer your question about what is standard. I can guess that non-stick pans would be one way to avoid oil. Another way is to just shape the bread in big round pillow and bake it in an oven instead of a bread machine. When you bake it in an oven, you can put it on a silicon mat or parchment paper and I imagine that no oil would be needed in that case either. (though I dont know) . Stepping back a second. My philosophy: While I typically avoid oils in the food I cook, Im not opposed to occasionally greasing a pan for a special recipe. I think that is a reasonable way to use oils in ones life if I dont have heart disease or diabetes. Thats just my approach which Im sharing in case you would find it helpful. Ruth Spelt is an old fashion wheat flower that hasnt been messed with like the regular bread wheat. Its own gluton content is much lower because of not messing with it. Your bread will be lighter using the gluton flower with it. It is the gluton stretching that helps the bread to rise. AnnieVanCookie You made me laugh with the until know thing xD!! I wonder why theres people with sad diet and arent obese. I have been all my life struggling to loose weight even though I always ate healthy. I see people eating crap everyday and they just wont get fat. TofuAnnie I liked this pop-up as well! Your voice kept on as youre mini-me pointed to the until now. Its your signature, so why not?! I need to go back and re-watch the mircobiome videos. Thanks for your work, doc. David J Sorry but although I found it ok, it will keep me from sending it to skeptical people I am trying to convince to take this kind of work seriously. Nancy Altman It humor. Just humor. Come on, people, lighten up! Its good for your health! Thea AnnieVanCookie: Why do some people get fat and some stay thin when eating pretty much the same type of SAD diet? Why do some people get or stay fat even when they try to eat healthy? Its a great question. Dr. Lisle, one of the experts from Forks Over Knives, does a good job of answering that question at the beginning of his talk, How To Lose Weight Without Losing Your Mind: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAdqLB6bTuQ AZ DONALD hi thea, i searched and searched last night but couldnt find the video i was looking for and am hoping you can direct me to it. recently, dr G changed his recommendation from methyl cobalomin to cyano cobalomin because a small percentage of people dont absorb the methyl. are you able to direct me to that one? thanks, donald. Thea AZ DONALD: From my memory, Dr. Greger has always recommended the cyanocobalamin form. Here are a couple pages where you see that recommendation: An Ask the Doctor page from 2012: http:///questions/which-type-of-b12-is-best/ General nutrition recommendations from 2011: http:///2011/09/12/dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations/ In the new book (How Not To Die), Dr. Greger talks about recommending the cyano  form because thats the one that is tested in studies showing that it works. We dont have the body of evidence showing that the other forms work. . If there is a page where Dr. Greger talks about changing his recommendation on B12, Im sorry but Im not aware of it. kari228 Great Share, I had never seen this before. Erica Would you add an even greater benefit to the mixed whole grains by chilling them before eating? Im curious whether we would get the benefits of resistant starches with chilled whole grains. The studies we had seen previously showed a benefit when processed or refined (white) grains where cooled/chilled and then consumed. Yes, that works if theyre chilled AFTER theyve been cooked. They can be reheated and the resistant starches will remain. Mike Quinoa What about whole grain pasta thats not even cooked in the first place? I sometimes cold-cook pasta by just leaving it in cold water for a few hours, and then using it in a bean / pasta salad. David Hochstettler I tried making bread without flour sugar and oil for over a year and finally let it go. Now I eat a slice of ezekial bread every day to satisfy my cravings for bread and 300 grams of cooked whole wheat ,barley and brown rice in their whole form. To cook it I boil 3 quarts of water and add 3 cups of wheat berries and a 1/2 a cup each of pearl barley and brown rice and simmer for an hour. Quick cool it by running cold water through it in a strainer and bag it up in 300 gram fold top sandwich bags. Richard You bring out a good point: bread is addictive! I cant find where I read it before, but wheat has some kind of morphine-like substance it it. Bread is also an SOS (salt, oil, sugar) food. In fact, the average American gets more salt from bread than any other food. Bread has a high glycemic index, higher than intact grains. Trouble is, when Im hungry, its the most convenient and appealing thing in the house. That is, it was. From now on, Im going to keep bread out of my house and have some baked potatoes or yams in the fridge. Ben The ezekial breads and the silver hills breads are both healthy. Vege-tater I often microwave a large sweet potato, then slice it and make thin toast for a quick bread. Steve Billig I did not see in the study descriptions whether the whole grain variety that makes a difference in microbial richness (great term) is required over the course of a day, or perhaps over the course of a week. Did anyone pick that up? susan good question Steve, and its an interesting answer ! the transcript says they used whole grain barley, or whole grain brown rice and the combination of the two worked better than either alone . hmm might be able to make a cold chopped vegie salad using both grains that wouldnt be bad ! hope that answers your question steve. susan sorry steve, I may have missed your question.. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3744518/figure/F1/ this page details showing the number of grams per day over the course of how many weeks . Steve Billig Variety, to me, is one of foundations of healthy eating. Research shows that variety even trumps volume (more types of healthy foods yields better health than more volume of healthy foods). My understanding is that the way to achieve variety is to eat all the plant-based food groups (fruit, veg, grains, legumes, nuts/seeds) over the course of a day, and a variety within each food group over the course of a week (variety of nuts, or veg (crucifers/onion family/starchy family/leafy green family, etc.). Since the research only tested daily variety and not weekly variety, we do not know for sure, so in order to go with what we know, eat a variety of grains daily. susan Makes total sense to me steve. They achieved a better result mixing two varieties, so I would think it would be very beneficial to mix it up over the course of the week. I plan on mixing up grains in salads more often.. throwing in some lentils too, and trying new combinations. thanks Steve ! Wegan No, you said the t word. Ed Glad to see you more animated in your videos, but this one needs fireworks and music. I recently tried a newer probiotic with 115 interdependent strains, as I eat more veggies, beans,and lentils than most the changes were profound.This information can still kick my biome into another gear.

Comments As the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline continue to escalate, the crackdown from law enforcement has grown harsher and harsher. Hundreds have been arrested by Morton County police, many of them without charge, and have had their civil rights violated by shockingly cruel police officers, who are sexually humiliating their prisoners by strip-searching them and leaving them naked in their cells. When getting booked at the jail, they were all strip searched, forced to squat and cough to demonstrate they had nothing hidden in their rectums, then were put in orange jumpsuits. The treatment was the same for Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Dave Archambault, to a pediatrician from the reservation, Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, to actress Shailene Woodley, star of the films Divergent and Snowden, among others. The use of a strip search for those arrested on trumped-up charges like trespassing and rioting is a clear intimidation tactic that shows the the United States government still sees Native Americans as savages to be abused. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard told The Young Turks how her daughter was arrested, stripped of her clothes by three male and one female officer, and then left naked in a cell overnight. Theyre targeting our families she said. Human rights abuses have been widely committed by police and security forces as they try to discourage the protesters. Rebecca Kemble, Alderwoman from Madison, Wisconsin, recounts how arrested protesters are beaten and thrown into pieces of the very pipeline they are protesting. I saw the Marathon County deputy push her down the hill and slam her body and head into the transport van after this. Georgianne Nienaber of the Huffington Post knows where to point the finger for these outrageous crimes. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier is the official who sets the tone for police actions in Morton County North Dakota. He alone determines how prisoners are treated. He holds the authority to enforce humane treatment or encourage cruelty designed to instill fear, humiliation, embarrassment and shame. And shame is the ultimate weaponutilized by the narcissist in a pitiful attempt to gain control and break the spirit of his victims. This kind of systematic violence is the way the U.S. government has always treated the native inhabitants of the American continent. Very little mainstream news coverage is documenting these crimes, instinctively taking the side of the corporation plotting to desecrate the sacred grounds of the Standing Rock Sioux in order to make a quick buck off of climate-warming and water-poisoning fossil fuels. We cannot allow the police state to squash the will of the people. Listen to LaDonna Brave Bull Allard tell her story here:
License DMCA I woke up yesterday (Thursday) to a small but somewhat encouraging snippet on page 19 of my local (German) paper headlined "Trump: Clinton Risking World War," referring to Trump's remarks on Tuesday in a Reuters interview that was headlined "Trump says Clinton policy on Syria would lead to World War Three." The five-sentence German article ended with this: "Critics noted that such [no-fly zones as proposed by Clinton] might have to be enforced militarily." This was apparently (back-translating from the German) a translation of "Some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the United States into direct conflict with Russian fighter jets" (Reuters). The Reuters article goes on to say: "Clinton's campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.""'Once again, he is parroting Putin's talking points and playing to Americans' fears, all while refusing to lay out any plans of his own for defeating ISIS or alleviating humanitarian suffering in Syria,' Clinton spokesman Jesse Lehrich said in a statement." The New York Times and other mainstream outlets reported similarly. I suppose this is considered "balanced" coverage -- as if what Lehrich or "Clinton's campaign" said was a substantive response to what Trump has finally said clearly and should be obvious. To their credit, the BBC did add (at the end of a 21-sentence article) that Trump "echoes concerns raised last month at a congressional hearing by the highest-ranking military officer in the US armed forces." "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford told lawmakers a 'no-fly zone' in Syria could spell war with Russia. 'Right now, senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria it would require us to go to war, against Syria and Russia,' Gen. Dunford told the Senate Arms Services Committee." - Advertisement - At this point, just days before the election, it is probably too late, but it would be Trump's last opportunity to appear statesmanlike, and also save the planet from the catastrophic military adventurism that Clinton seems bound to embark on if she becomes commander-in-chief. At the least it would be a chance to ratchet up popular protest against the warmongering that has driven virtually all U.S. foreign policy since WWII, and is now taking us (and by "us" I mean the world) directly toward the precipice of WWIII. "Stop demonizing Russia; work with them, not against them." This is the message that needs to be shouted from the rooftops, and surely Trump has access to experts like Stephen Cohen, Ray McGovern, Robert Parry and others who can help him do so. He should be able to easily "trump" the empty arguments of the bellicose Russia-bashers, even if the latter are aligned across party lines against him -- and against us, since the war they are pushing for will be global. How stupid does one have to be to propose "no-fly zones" when the highest military officer in the country says it would result in war with Russia? How stupid does one have to be to believe that Putin is "Hitler," that Russia shot down MH17 and is guilty of "aggression" on the eastern European borders, in Ukraine, and in Syria, without ever questioning the "evidence" for any of these assertions, much less the equally problematic role the U.S. has played in every case? Yet this is the mainstream narrative, repeated uniformly and relentlessly at every turn. Trump is obviously not the best candidate in this race (Jill Stein is), but he is right on this most important issue of relations with Russia, which should have been the No. 1 issue from the beginning. So there is still a slight chance that Trump (and Stein also!) can at least go down with a (non-nuclear!) bang, not a whimper -- by giving peace, and reason, a chance. We should all hope that happens. - Advertisement -
License DMCA The United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the world's "gold standard" that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The "wise men" of the system simply insist otherwise. We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens' judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000). The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nation's leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized. Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldn't vote). - Advertisement - Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedy's vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the South's heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners. However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixon's Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960. - Advertisement - Nixon's "Treason" So, by 1968, the Democrats' once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didn't want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that -- with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided -- President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam. President Richard Nixon with his then-National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in 1972. License DMCA The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixon's campaign went behind Johnson's back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnson's Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixon's emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam.
License DMCA This is not about how politics controls research on cancer and other diseases. It is about a political economy which, in the name of democracy, is killing us.Today, I got my PSA score (used to assess degree of cancer), and it was not down, after 4 months of a heavy duty cannabis extract treatment and numerous anti-cancer supplements, along with a vegan anti-cancer diet. It didn't go down. After my cancerous prostate was removed 10 years, ago I had nearly 8 yrs cancer free, then two years, ago the score began to rise, from .2 to .4. to .5 to today's .6. That is a low score, but it is growing and my treatments have not stopped it. I ask: how can I have got cancer when since age 26, I have been on an organic anti-cancer diet? There are two theories, not necessarily incompatible: one asserts, as the man who discovered the cause of cancer did, that the cause is pollution. Dr. Warburg won the Nobel Prize but the Nazis kept him from accepting it. He said pollution caused cancer. The other theory is the genetic element: studies on twins seem to show that there is a genetic component, which may not cause cancer but predispose to it, make us vulnerable to the onslaught of pollution. So I am going to go with the idea that tho genetics makes some more susceptible, it is pollution which is killing us. On a gross level, this is easy to see. Each year, millions die from fossil fuel pollution; in the US, 13,000 die from coal pollution, and tens of millions suffer from air pollution, not to mention water pollution as in Flint, Michagan and many other cities. - Advertisement - Why do we have so much pollution? Why haven't we switched to clean energy? Why haven't we banned fossil fuels, which are poisons we eat and drink and breath every day? We know that pollution kills, makes sick, decreases productivity, increases healthcare costs, makes us suffer and destroys the environment, including climate disruption? Why is nothing being done? The reason is simple: politics. The oligarchy is made up of those who profit from pollution, from the energy industry to the ag industry. In a democracy, these corporations which are killing us would be stopped. But in an oligarchy where the polluters rule, all action is to prevent action; private profits trump public safety. Money trumps human health. Accumulating billions is more important than protecting the earth. This is a political decision, within a system of oligarchic rule. We are being killed by cancer because the ruling class has hijacked government and made effective regulation impossible. We are being killed by design, since the fossil fuel elites know the damage their products do. And so, as I ponder my next treatment (probably immunotherapy), I ask everyone to consider how our politics, mostly right wing, Republican, pro-corporate but including the establishment Democrats. Clinton, for instance, has received 7 million from the fossil fuel people this year. Clinton is also on record of supporting fracking. - Advertisement - Here is what Sanders said of her in April: ""Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs, when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water," he said April 10, "and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country." Politifact concludes that "Clinton's past support of fracking is well documented." And so it is not only the Republican's who are blocking action to reduce the damage done by fossil fuels; it is also the Democrats, who are bribed with millions to continue the status quo. Now Clinton says she wants solar on every roof. That is easy to say, and it will get some Bernie supporters to accept her. But her history is of defending the fossil fuel industry. And history trumps hypotheticals. Early detection means early treatment License DMCA Conclusion: pollution is killing us. Both parties have protected this lethal industry to varying degrees. It seems, as with so much else, that if we want change, if we want to stop killing ourselves with toxins in our air and food and water, we will have to finally end the rule of the oligarchs and establish a democratic nation, where the leaders lead in ending pollution and transforming us to clean energy and with it, better health for our families and our earth.

 In addition to the cyber manipulation of electronic voting (see http://www./2016/11/01/very-easy-to-invisibly-steal-us-elections/ ), Finian Cunningham explains a second method the Oligarchy has prepared that would allow the election to be stolen for Hillary. The groundwork that has been officially established indicates that a false flag cyber attack is the preferred method.A Digital 9/11 If Trump Wins by Finian Cunningham There are disturbing signs that a digital 9/11 false flag terror attack is being readied for election day in the US to ensure that Donald Trump does not win. Such an attack  involving widespread internet and power outage  would have nothing to do with Russia or any other foreign state. It would be furnished by agencies of the US Deep State in a classic false flag covert manner. But the resulting chaos and assault on American democracy will be conveniently blamed on Russia. That presents a double benefit. Russia would be further demonized as a foreign aggressor justifying even harsher counter measures by America and its European allies against Moscow. Secondly, a digital attack on Americas presidential election day this week, would allow the Washington establishment to pronounce a Trump win invalid due to Russian cyber subversion. Invalidation is a prepared option if the ballot results show Republican candidate Donald Trump as the imminent victor. Democrat rival Hillary Clinton is the clear choice for the White House among the Washington establishment. She has the backing of Wall Street finance capital, the corporate media, the military-industrial complex and the Deep State agencies of the Pentagon and CIA. The fix has been in for months to get her elected by the powers-that-be owing to her well-groomed obedience to American imperialist interests. The billionaire property magnate Trump is too much of a maverick to be entrusted with the White House, as far as the American ruling elite are concerned. The trouble is that, despite the massive campaign to discredit Trump, polls show his support remains stubbornly close to Clintons. The latter has been tainted with too many scandals involving allegations of sleazy dealings with Wall Street, so-called pay-for-play favors while she was former Secretary of State, and her penchant for inciting overseas wars for regime change using jihadist terrorist foot-soldiers. As one headline from McClatchy News only days ago put it: Majority of voters think Clinton acted illegally, new poll finds. http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article112635048.html#emlnl=Evening Newsletter Trump is right. The US presidential election is rigged. The system is heavily stacked against any candidate who does not conform with the interests of the establishment. The massive media-orchestrated campaign against Trump is testimony to that. But such is popular disgust with Clinton, her sleaze-ball husband Bill and the Washington establishment that her victory is far from certain. Indeed in the last week before voting this Tuesday various polls are showing a neck-and-neck race with even some indicators putting the Republican narrowly ahead. Over the weekend, the Washington Post, which has been one of the main media outlets panning Trump on a daily basis, reported this: The electoral map is definitely moving in Trumps direction. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/04/dont-look-now-the-electoral-map-is-definitely-moving-in-donald-trumps-direction/?wpisrc=nl headlines&wpmm=1 In recent days, American media are reporting a virtual state of emergency by the US government and its security agencies to thwart what they claim are Russian efforts to incite election day cyber mayhem. In one exclusive report by the NBC network on November 3, it was claimed that: The US government believes hackers from Russia or elsewhere may try to undermine next weeks presidential election and is mounting an unprecedented effort to counter their cyber meddling. http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-house-readies-fight-election-day-cyber-mayhem-n677636?cid=sm tw On November 4, the Washington Post reported: Intelligence officials warn of Russian mischief in election and beyond. https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russia-seen-as-unable-to-alter-election-but-may-still-seek-to-undermine-it/2016/11/03/b7387160-a1cd-11e6-8832-23a007c77bb4 story.html Apparently, the emergency security response is being coordinated by the White House, the Department of Homeland Security, the CIA, the National Security Agency and other elements of the Defense Department, according to NBC. These claims of Russian state hackers interfering in the US political system are not new. Last month, the Obama administration officially accused Moscow of this alleged malfeasance. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/07/us-russia-dnc-hack-interfering-presidential-election Russian President Vladimir Putin has lambasted American claims that his country is seeking to disrupt the presidential elections as hysterical nonsense, aimed at distracting the electorate from far more deep-rooted internal problems. http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-rejects-claims-russian-interference-us-election-43103312 The Obama administration and its state security agencies have not provided one iota of evidence to support their allegations against Russia. Nevertheless the repeated charges have a tendency to stick. The Clinton campaign has for months been accusing Trump of being a pro-Russian stooge. Clintons campaign has also claimed that Russian hackers have colluded with the whistleblower organization Wikileaks to release thousands of private emails damaging Clinton with the intention of swaying the election in favor of Trump. Wikileaks director Julian Assange and the Russian government have both rejected any suggestion that they are somehow collaborating, or that they are working to get Trump elected. But on the eve of the election, the US authorities are recklessly pushing hysteria that Russia is trying to subvert American democracy. Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014 is quoted as saying: The Russians are in an offensive mode and the US is working on strategies to respond to that, and at the highest levels. NBC cites a senior Obama administration official as saying that the Russians want to sow as much confusion as possible and undermine our process. Ominously, the news outlet adds that steps are being taken to prepare for worst-case scenarios, including a cyber-attack that shuts down part of the power grid or the internet. Nearly two weeks ago, on October 21-22, the US was hit with a widespread internet outage. The actors behind the distributed denial of service were not identified, but the disruption was nationwide and it temporarily disabled many popular consumer services. One former official at the US Department of Homeland Security described the event as having all the signs of what would be considered a drill. http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/white-house-readies-fight-election-day-cyber-mayhem-n677636?cid=sm tw Could that cyber-attack have been the work of US Deep State agencies as a dress rehearsal for an even bigger outage planned for November 8  election day? The Washington establishment wants Clinton over Trump. Shes the marionette of choice for their strategic interests, including a more hostile foreign policy towards Russia in Syria, Ukraine and elsewhere. But Trump might prove to be the voters choice. In which case, the shadowy forces that really rule America can trigger a digital 9/11. Its not difficult to imagine the chaos and mayhem from internet blackout, power, transport, banking and communications paralysis  even for just a temporary period of a few hours. Months of fingering Russia as a destabilizing foreign enemy intent on interfering in US democracy to get Comrade Trump into the White House would then serve as a self-fulfilling prophecy. In that event, the US authorities could plausibly move to declare the election of Donald J Trump null and void. In fact the scenario could be contrived to a far more serious level than merely invalidating the election result. The US authorities could easily feign that a state of emergency is necessary in order to defend national security. That contingency catapults beyond rigged politics. It is a green light for a coup dtat by the Deep State forces who found that they could not win through the normal rigging methods.Originally published: https://sputniknews.com/columnists/201611061047117877-digital-9-11-if-trump-wins/ The post  appeared first on PaulCraigRoberts.org .

By  on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016 at 3:23 pm He is taking the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throwing them back in Republicans' faces.   *The following is an opinion column by R Muse* Although this campaign season has been interesting, to say the least, there is something happening one never thought would occur. After spending nearly eight years demonizing, obstructing, and criticizing every and anything about the President of the United States, Republicans desperate to save their jobs are beginning to tout their  imagined  close ties to the Democratic President whose approval rating and popularity are growing. It is hypocritical, to say the least, and at some point a result of a toxic Republican candidate for the presidency, but for some GOP candidates it is a very dangerous strategy. If any Republican believed President Obama would allow them to take advantage of him after spending eight years assailing him as illegitimate and corrupt, they were sadly mistaken and underestimated the commander in chiefs tolerance during an election. The President is using the final two weeks before the election to decimate Republicans for either  belated rejection  or continued support of Donald Trump. President Obama is also reminding Republicans that  Donald Trump is the endpoint of eight years of [GOP] toxic hostility . It may be a tad of an exaggeration to claim that  Obama seems determined to spend the last two weeks of the election laying waste to every Republican who ever crossed him , but he is getting some well-placed and well-warranted shots at Republicans. Two Republican hypocrites hoping to take advantage of the Presidents approval ratings have been some of his harshest critics; so it likely stunned the President that they are boasting working closely with the man they obstructed, opposed, and attempted to get rid of. Ohio Senator Rob Portman had the temerity to run a campaign ad boasting about working closely with the President to break the grip of heroin addiction. President Obama took the time to excoriate Portman for,  Finally withdrawing his support from Donald Trump , but only  After looking at the polling. Now that its politically expedient. But he has supported him up until last week? So I guess it was OK when Trump was attacking minorities, and suggesting that Mexicans were rapists   and insulting Gold Star moms, making fun of disabled Americans. I guess that didnt quite tip it over the edge. Why was that OK? And now he says he will vote for the vice-presidential nominee instead, except that guy still supports Donald Trump.  The President was a little more exercised after learning that the man who called the President  one of the most corrupt presidents in modern times, California Republican Representative Daryl Issa, is sending out campaign mailers with the Presidents face on them and boasting about his close work with President Obama  to protect victims of sexual assault . Daryl Issa is in a fairly competitive race compared to past elections and he certainly has earned the Presidents wrath after obstructing progress and wasting taxpayer money on Issa-created scandals. During a fundraiser in La Jolla California Sunday last, the President assailed Issa for having the audacity to use a campaign mailer with the Presidents image on it. The President said,  Issas primary contribution to the United States Congress has been to obstruct and to waste taxpayer dollars on trumped-up investigations that have led nowhere. This is now a guy who, because poll numbers are bad, has sent out brochures with my picture on them touting his cooperation on issues with me. Now that is the definition of chutzpah. As remarked by Tim Murphy at Mother Jones, President Obama is not just evening up the score with Republicans who made his tenure miserable,  He is attempting to have the last word on the personal and political fights of the last eight yearsto take the conspiracy theories and obstruction that dogged his presidency from day one and throw them back in Republicans faces . The President clearly has a lot of  words  to harangue Republicans with. He said ,  Heres the thing. For years, Republican politicians and the far-right media outlets have pumped up all kinds of crazy stuff about me. About Hillary. About Harry. They said I wasnt born here. They said climate change is a hoax. They said that I was going to take everybodys guns away! They said that while we were doing military exercises that weve been doing forever, suddenly this was a plot to impose martial law. This is what theyve been saying for years now! So people have been hearing it they start thinking well maybe its true! And if the world theyve been seeing is Im powerful enough to cause hurricanes on my own and to steal everybodys guns in the middle of the night and impose martial laweven though I cant talk without a prompterthen is it any wonder that they end up nominating somebody like Donald Trump? And the fact is that there are a lot of politicians who knew better. There are a lot of senators who knew better but they went along with these stories because they figured you know what thisll help rile up the base, itll give us an excuse to obstruct what were trying to do, we wont be able to appoint judges, well gum up the works, well create gridlock, itll give us a political advantage. So they just stood by and said nothing and their base began to actually believe this stuff. So Donald Trump did not start this. Donald Trump didnt start it, he just did what he always did which is slap his name on it, take credit for it, and promote it. Thats what he always does. And so now, when suddenly its not working and people are saying wow this guys kind of out of line, all of a sudden these Republican politicians who were okay with all this crazy stuff up to a point suddenly theyre all walking away. Oh, this is too much. So when you finally get him on tape bragging about actions that qualify as sexual assault and his poll numbers go down, suddenly thats a deal-breaker. Well what took you so long! What the heck! What took you so long! All these years! The Mother Jones piece made out like President Obama is seeking retribution, or  revenge  against Republicans for their impropriety as legislators over the past eight years. Without knowing what goes on in the Presidents head to motivate his campaign rhetoric; that is a hard call to make with any surety. Barack Obama does not strike one as being vindictive. The President is, though, an accomplished campaigner and as his tenure in the White House is winding down and Republicans are struggling to find an identity apart from Donald Trump, it is prudent of the President to remind voters exactly what Republicans are about and what they are about is precisely why Donald Trump is their standard bearer; and why Republicans are hypocrites for both abandoning Trump and embracing the man they obstructed and tried to remove from the White House.
Sales of emergency survival food are increasing as we approach election day, and rightfully so. With Hillary Clinton and other democrats hellbent on resuscitating a non-existent Cold War and the violent riots weve seen by so-called protesters at Donald trump rallies, many preppers are seeing the signs and preparing for post-election unrest by storing large amounts of non-perishable food.Although it is quite normal to see long-term storable foods rise in sales around election time, but survival food companies are seeing a particularly large spike in business this year as we approach election day.This is more intense than what we saw in 2012, Keith Bansemer, marketing VP for My Patriot Supply, a survival food company, told NBC news. He says that last election season doubled their sales, and this time around they have seen their sales triple. We have everyone we can on the phones. We are overwhelmed, said Bensemer. Those who expect Trump to win fear a revolt from violent anti-Trump protesters, such as the riot seen in San Jose , California outside of a Trump rally. Others who expect Hillary Clintons coronation to the presidency are preparing for a possible World War 3 scenario, which may be a very well-founded concern considering Clintons war-driven rhetoric about Russias involvement in Syria and the establishment of no-fly zones in air space around Aleppo.However, not everyone is preparing for war with another country. Many are preparing for government-related threats to their life and liberty. One of the major threats we face is the ever-increasing desire of politicians to take away our guns and the resulting chaos that would ensue. Hillary Clinton completely disregards the second amendment, and the possibility that she would enact gun confiscation across the country should not be discounted. This would mean a declaration of war on the people, or at least those who cherish freedom.Bansemer does not think his customer base is fearing for any specific election outcome. He thinks that many just want to be prepared for whatever may come as a result of either of these candidates policies.You hear them saying, no matter who wins, I know I could take a positive step myself and secure whats important, he explained. Theyre securing their food supply. A number of other long-term food suppliers are seeing an increase as well.Legacy Foods is predicting that sales will jump in the weeks following the election, said owner Phil Cox. Legacy sells a $2,000 package of a years worth of storable food, containing nearly 1,100 meals and sealed in military-grade Mylar packs.Retailers are noticing the increase of sales of long-term food and they are serving the market. Costco is also getting into the emergency food market with a 390-serving bucket, or one months supply of food, for $115. Store owner Larry Friedman is unsure what to make of the increased presence of preppers at his military surplus supply store, M&G. Some are regulars in here, said Friedman. They come in, seem perfectly normal, and then suddenly, theyre talking about the apocalypse. You do a double-take.Friedman recalled seeing an increase of sales like this nearly two decades ago, after the original invasion of Iraq:It really started in 91 with Desert Storm. People were worried about Scud missiles and chemical weapons from Iraq. We had so many people waiting we almost couldnt close the doors. We sold every gas mask we could get our hands on. That was off the hook. Whatever reason one may have for preparing, there is no question that if disaster strikes and food becomes scarce, food will become a primary currency , and storable food will become highly valuable. Theres no good reason to pass up the opportunity to prepare.

Brilliant Takedown Of Feminism From An Old Man Brilliant Takedown Of Feminism From An Old Man December 28, 2012 30 Comments Culture Many of you are probably familiar with Fred On Everything , a member of the old guard when it comes to the fight against feminism. His Hooking Up article gives a birds-eye view of how feminism corrupted women, in a way that only a senior citizen who has seen it all can elucidate. What I dont get is, why are gals bitching? This is the world they wanted. They clawed and scratched and burned their bras and had court cases and threw fits to get exactly what they have. They hated men because, they said, men werent letting them copulate frantically like men had always wanted them to. Men, or more likely their mothers, didnt let them make themselves unattractive by dressing like hod-carriers and swearing like sailors. Finally men gave in and now women hate them for that . Whatever happened to gratitude? [ ] Sally Sue might have teeth like pearls and brains and perky tits and a wacky sense of humor and actually be quite a prize, but sex trumps art. If Sally didnt say Yes, she knew that Greta would. Women had commoditized themselves. It was a marvelous thing for the testosterone wads we think of as college boys. [ ] All you want is sex! Uh what else have you got? or So what? Or, Marriage? Why? Would sex be better? Would food taste better? I dont get it. Or, Marriage doesnt make sense. Do you want to eat in the same restaurant all your life? Women werent happen then and arent happy now. Trying to please them will just sacrifice what you want while giving no guarantee that theyll be content, yet we still have beta males and white knights fighting among each other to appease the unappeasable. Will they collectively realize their folly? Maybe a more relevant question is if we want them to wake up. When Im looting the Best Buy after a hurricane, I dont want to compete with other looters. Its possible the quality of goods Id be able to steal would be much less due to the competition.
Since we were children, we have been bombarded with propaganda that romantic love is the ultimate relationship ideal. Hollywood movies, Disney cartoons, and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding union, but how much of that narrative has been a lie? Is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair bond?I began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root. Love is a fleeting emotion, and like all emotions, it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky. Why have I been taught to select my life partner based on an emotion? Im surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a house, applying for a job, or doing my personal finances, but when it comes to choosing a human being that Im supposed to spend the rest of my life with, Im advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them all.Another major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged marriages, where partners are picked based on purely practical matters, have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates ( 1 , 2 , 3 ). While there are multiple reasons for divorce in any society, it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates .Romance was invented It turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority. Romanticism, a movement that began in the 18th century, put romantic love at the forefront, not just for individuals but nations as well, all from a central thesis of individualism. It wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel .The movement came primarily from bourgeois youth, who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings. the Romantic Movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois conventions, bourgeois society and morality. To be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young Romantic. The Romantics were, in fact, bourgeois origins, who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows. ( Source )[ ] Romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by Bourgeois society. ( Source They sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors , many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against privilege and inequality to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it. Combined with the fact that SJWs also trump feelings over logic, its clear to see how romanticists were proto-SJWs, whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of tradition.Romantics re-defined what relationships should be based on Prior to the romantic era, companionate love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical writings.Passionate love is the arousal-driven emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of happiness, and can also give people feelings of anguish. Companionate love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two people, and gives people feelings of peace. Scientists have described the stage of passionate love as being on cocaine, since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter, dopamine, as when cocaine is being used. ( Source )Besides Song Of Songs in the Old Testament , writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate love, and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new marriages, but its this passionate love that were told to strive for, of feeling like youve been swept up in an exciting whirlwind, before publishing the gory details on Buzzfeed or in a bestseller like Eat Pray Love, authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce .Women of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic love, and why wouldnt they? Its much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by non-committal alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you husband, king, and God. Women were given the chance to pick between excitement or responsibility, and we know what they have chosen.The works of the Romantic Era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience, partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period. The Romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers. ( Source )The modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love Jewish psychologist Robert Sternberg proposed the popular triangular theory of love , which is often used today as defining the love ideal. This theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful relationship.Anyone who takes an introductory psychology course, or who reads a pop psychology book, will be exposed to this theory, and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship. If its not there, the presumption is that the relationship is no longer consummate and far short of ideal.Believing that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of it, because when a woman no longer feels passion, she will walk away knowing that experts like Sternberg would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving. And this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves. They have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding vows, especially upon realizing that they initiate 80% of divorces .Romanticism and the rise of nationalism If nationalism came out of the romantic era, and passionate love was a mistake, does that mean nationalism is also a mistake?One of Romanticisms key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism, which became a central theme of Romantic art and political philosophy. From the earliest parts of the movement, with their focus on development of national languages and folklore, and the importance of local customs and traditions, to the movements that would redraw the map of Europe and lead to calls for self-determination of nationalities, nationalism was one of the key vehicles of Romanticism, its role, expression and meaning.[ ] Patriotism, nationalism, revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period. ( Source )Upon closer inspection, its easy to see that the ruling agenda of today, globalism , is essentially world nationalism. Instead of loving your neighbor, and only those who share your unique traditions or race, youre supposed to love everyone in the world , because its evil to think that there are large differences between a German businessman in a Hugo Boss suit and a Tutsi villager with a lip plate the size of a grapefruit.The romantic ideal of nationalism is not Adolph Hitler, but George Soros , who insists on loving everyone in the world from the depths of your heartfelt human compassion. A nationalism based on genetics and local bonds will no doubt serve citizens better than a global nationalism where youre supposed to care for those who are nothing like you.How should men choose their life partners? Its clear that using romantic love and passion as your primary standard for long-term relationships will lead to failure and maybe even personal catastrophe. Youll easily come to this conclusion by evaluating your past relationships and the mistakes youve made on women who you had intense passion for.Instead, practicality must be the order of the day. You must logically evaluate any woman you intend to be with for more than a casual relationship by weighing her values, beliefs, and sexual history. This is easier said than done because weve been so brainwashed to believe passion is important, but it simply makes the most amount of sense. Find a woman the same way you would find a new job or buy a new house, and be wary of women who picked you based more on passion than practical matters.It may sound cold to search for your wife like you would a business partner, but that is exactly what she is. The day-to-day life of a family home is far more business and economics than love, and so you should come to the easy conclusion that thats what you must use to form a stable home.Understand, however, that we do not live in a traditional and patriarchal society that aids us in our search for a virtuous woman. Instead, society is encouraging women to corrupt themselves, sexually and physically, in the name of empowerment and independence, making our search exceedingly difficult. This is one of the costs we have to pay for living in the modern world. Some men will be able to overcome it, but many men wont, and will fail in their search for a woman they can create a family with.But at least we are now armed with the knowledge of what it takes to have a more successful long-term relationship. Its not romantic love or butterflies in the stomach, but a matter of practicality. Logically evaluate her past, her values, and her beliefs to make sound predictions of how shell behave in the future. From this evaluation will come a logical decision that is likely to endure, instead of relying on emotion, which changes as readily as the direction of the wind.Read More: Unconditional Love From A Woman Is Impossible
Written by    To understand the situation in Aleppo is to understand the key to the conflict in Syria at this juncture: Will Washington and its allies or the Syrian Army and Russia liberate Raqqa, the capital of the so-called Islamic State. It does not take a military genius to discern Washingtons strategy in prolonging the military operation being conducted by the Syrian Army, supported by Russia, to liberate eastern Aleppo  which remains occupied by Nusra Front and the moderates fighting alongside the Salafi-jihadist group. Keeping the Syrian and Russian military forces bogged down in eastern Aleppo is key to allowing the US-led coalition to complete the operation, currently underway, to take the Iraqi city of Mosul from ISIS, before continuing an east-west advance across the Syrian border to take Raqqa. Raqqa will then be established as the de facto capital of so-called moderate Syrian forces, which will re-group there, presumably under cover of a US-imposed no-fly zone, to become a counterweight to the authority of the Assad government in Damascus. Such a development would also establish a permanent US military presence in a country that has long been key to Washingtons objective of dominating the region. That aspect of this strategy is, of course, illegal under the terms of the UN Charter, and is of minor consequence to an imperial power that has long viewed international law as an optional extra when it comes to pursuing its strategic and geopolitical objectives across the globe. When it comes to the Middle East we are talking a region rich in natural resources, specifically oil. And though not vital in terms of US energy needs, the sea of oil upon which the region sits is undeniably key to the stability of global energy prices. And that is vital to the US economy. As Gal Luft, Senior Adviser to the United States Energy Security Council, observed in a 2014 report, While the US is not dependent on the Middle East for the physical supply of oil, it is dependent on the region for price stability. The US economy is highly susceptible to spikes in oil prices. Luft goes on, Over the past 40 years every major hike in oil prices was followed by a recession, and most of those spikes occurred as a result of turmoil in the Middle East: the Arab Oil Embargo, the Iran-Iraq War, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, etc. As far back as January, US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter was discussing the importance of Raqqa to US military strategy in Syria. In a speech to the 101st Airborne Division at its Fort Campbell HQ in Kentucky on 13 January, he said, our campaign plans map has got big arrows pointing at both Mosul and Raqqa. We will begin by collapsing ISILs control over both of these cities and then engage in elimination operations through other territories ISIL [ISIS] holds in Iraq and Syria. It is an objective the US Defense Secretary trumpeted again in a recent interview with NBC. "It's been long a part of our plan that the Mosul operation would kick off when it did, Carter revealed. This was a plan that goes back many months now and that Raqqa would follow soon behind." The howling at the moon weve been treated to in recent weeks from Washington and its European proxies, accusing Syria and Russia of targeting civilians in eastern Aleppo, is nothing more than deflection. It is designed to blunt what is an extremely difficult military operation to liberate a civilian population being held hostage by the sectarian butchers of Nusra and other terrorist groups, using women and children as human shields. We know this to be true because despite Russian and Syrian forces regularly establishing humanitarian corridors to allow civilians to leave eastern Aleppo they are prevented from doing so on pain of execution. The hypocrisy is laid bare when we consider the lack of concern in Washington for civilians living in government-controlled western Aleppo, who have been subjected to a reign of terror in the form of daily and nightly rocket attacks, including poison gas shells, from Nusra and their moderate allies in the east of the city. Washingtons overarching strategy in the conflict also allows us to understand its refusal to separate those moderate rebel groups it claims to have some influence over from their Nusra counterparts, as per the terms of the ceasefire agreed between Washington and Moscow at the beginning of September. The ceasefire was broken just six days after it began by a US-led airstrike killed dozens of Syrian troops during a battle against ISIS in the eastern city of Deir Ezzor, which Washington claimed was a mistake. Such a claim should be taken with the usual pinch of salt, especially when we consider that Deir Ezzor lies adjacent to Raqqa in eastern Syria and therefore will be vital to any future joint Syrian and Russian operation to liberate the city. Reaching Raqqa before the Syrian Army and its allies is now essential for the US, constituting as it does a last throw of the dice when it comes to its objective of bringing down the Assad government in Damascus, which has long been a thorn in the side of US hegemony in the region along with the regional agendas of its closest Middle East allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia. With Syria fatally weakened, US strategists believe, Hezbollah and Iran, the main prize, are also weakened - not to mention Russian power diminished when it comes to the wider struggle for a multipolar alternative to the unipolar status quo. In a repeat of the race for Berlin at the end of the Second World War, with the outcome shaping the future of Europe and wider world in the context of the ensuing Cold War, the future of Syria, the Middle East, and a world crying out for a multipolar alternative to US global hegemony now boils down to Raqqa.

 With Putin winning across the board, Washington is struggling to contain its humilitation Originally appeared at Strategic Culture Foundation The Obama administration is now accusing Russia of cyber-crime and trying to disrupt the US presidential election. The claim is so far-fetched, it is hardly credible. More credible is that the US is reeling from Putins stunning humiliation earlier this week. Since June, US media and supporters of Democrat presidential contender Hillary Clinton have been blaming Russian state-sponsored hackers for breaking into the Democratic partys database. It is further alleged that Moscow is stealthily trying to influence the outcome of the election, by releasing damaging information on Clinton, which might favor Republican candidate Donald Trump. Russia has vehemently denied any connection to the cyber-crime charges, or trying to disrupt the November poll. Now the Obama administration has stepped into the fray by openly accusing Russia. US government officially accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections, reported the Washington Post. This takes the row to a whole new level. No longer are the insinuations a matter of private, partisan opinion. The US government is officially labelling the Russian state for cyber-crime and political subversion. Predictably, following the latest allegations, there are calls among American lawmakers for ramping up more economic sanctions against Russia. While US intelligence figures are urging for retaliatory cyber-attacks on Russian government facilities. Vladimir Putins spokesman Dmitry Peskov derided the US claims as rubbish. He noted that the Kremlins computer system incurs hundreds of hacking attempts every day, many of which can be traced to American origin, but Moscow doesnt turn around and blame the US government for such cyber-attacks. There are several signs that the latest brouhaha out of Washington is a bogus diversion. As with previous Russian-hacker claims by the Democrats and US media, there is no evidence presented by the Obama administration to support its grave allegations against the Russian government. Assertion without facts does not meet a minimal standard of proof. When reports emerged in June  again through the Washington Post  that the Democrat National Committee (DNC) was hacked by Russian agents, the allegation relied on investigations by a private cyber security firm by the name of CrowdStrike. The firm is linked by personnel to the NATO-affiliated, anti-Russian think tank Atlantic Council. Again no verifiable evidence was presented then, just the word of a dubious partisan source. Back then the Russian scare story, for thats what it was, served as a useful diversion from far more important issues. Such as the 19,000 emails released from the DNC database showing that the party chiefs had preordained Clintons presidential nomination over her Democrat rival Bernie Sanders. Much-vaunted US democracy was exposed as a fraud, and so the Washington establishment quickly went into damage-limitation mode by smearing Russia. It was the whistleblower site Wikileaks, run by Australian journalist Julian Assange, that released the embarrassing emails. It had nothing to do with Russia. Assange has since hinted that his source was within the Democrat party itself. This is where it gets really explosive. Assange has vowed to release more emails that will prove that Clinton as Secretary of State back in 2011-2012 masterminded the supply of weapons and money to Islamist terror networks in Libya and Syria for the objective of regime change. Furthermore, Assange says that the emails prove that Clinton lied under oath to Congress when she denied in 2013 that she was had any involvement in facilitating arms to the jihadists. Assange has said that Wikileaks is going to publish the incriminating emails on Clintons alleged gun-running to terrorists this month. If the evidence stands up, Clinton could be prosecuted for perjury as well as treason in aiding and abetting official terrorist enemies of the US. The exposure of an American presidential candidate as being involved in state sponsorship of terrorism while serving as a top government official is a powerful incentive for the Obama administration to find a lurid diversion. Hence, the latest charges by the US government against Russia as perpetrating cyber-crime and of trying to subvert American democracy. This is just one more illustration of how irrational and unhinged the US government has become. Day by day, it seems, leads to more damning revelations of Washingtons complicity in illegal wars, covert subversion of foreign states, and systematic collusion with terrorist networks which have inflicted thousands of deaths on American citizens, among many more thousands of other innocent civilians around the world. In addition to exposure by sources like Wikileaks, much of revelation about US criminality and state-sponsored banditry has emerged from Russias principled military intervention in Syria. Russias intervention has not only helped salvage the Syrian nation from a foreign conspiracy of covert war for regime change. Russias intervention has also brought into clear focus the systematic links between Washington and its terrorist proxy army working on its behalf in Syria. Washingtons mask of moral and legal superiority has been ripped from its face. And what the world is seeing is the vile ugliness beneath. Such is Washingtons ignominious fall from pretend-grace to its grim, odious reality that Vladimir Putin this week was empowered to speak from the moral high ground. In announcing Russias unilateral suspension of a 2002 accord with the US for the disposal of nuclear-weapon-grade plutonium, Putin went much, much further. He gave Washington a list of ultimatums that included the US ending its trumped-up sanctions against Russia, with financial compensation, as well as the scaling back of NATO forces from Russias border. In other words, the Russian leader was talking truth to American power in a way that megalomaniac Washington, with all its ridiculous delusions of exceptionalism, has never ever heard before. American pretensions of greatness are eroding like a castle built on sand. Washingtons criminal enterprises and specifically the complicity in terrorism for the supreme crime of foreign aggression are being glaringly exposed. And now with due contempt, Russia is putting manners on Washington. It must be excruciating the humiliation for the narcissistic American tyrant to be treated with the disrespect that it deserves and which is long overdue. Moreover, the humiliation is not just in the eyes of the world. The American people can see the true ugly nature of their rulers too. When a giant banner declaring Putin a peacemaker was unfurled off Manhattan bridge in New York City this weekend, the popular enthusiasm went viral. Washington is reeling from Putins righteous courage to call it out for what it is. The truth-telling is hard to take for this unipolar unicorn. Its deluded myth-making about its own virtues are being stripped bare. Whats going on here is a world-class, historic exposure of American power as a nefarious excrescence on humanity. The reaction is understandable: foaming-at-the-mouth, desperate, hysterical and panicked. Accusing Russia of hacking into the American democratic process is a wild attempt to divert from the paramount issues: Washingtons exposed descent into a vile morass of its own making; the emperor is a criminal; the people know it; and a genuine world leader like Vladimir Putin has the temerity to lay it on the line to this has-been.
Originally appeared at The Blog Mire Following on from her recent piece for Time magazine , in which she so eloquently explained why America is indispensable and exceptional, TheBlogMire brings you an exclusive piece in which Mrs Clinton explains why an indispensable and exceptional nation must have an indispensable and exceptional leader. (Warning: May contain traces of satire) If theres one core belief that has guided and inspired me every step of my career in public service, its this: I am an exceptional woman. A great, unselfish, compassionate woman, to paraphrase Robert Kennedy. And when you add up all my advantages, its clear Im indispensable too  someone all others can look to for leadership. And what Im really excited about is not just that Im indispensable, but that Im about to become President of the indispensable nation. An indispensable nation needs an indispensable woman. An indispensable woman needs an indispensable nation. Its a match made in heaven, which is why I am asking you to help me break the glass ceiling on November 8th  so that together we can become even more exceptional than we already are. So what makes me so indispensable? Im indispensable in part because of my love for our armed forces. Our military is the greatest in history, with the best troops, training and technology, and I believe it is a travesty that we are not using it to its full potential. Its essential we do everything we can to support our men and women in uniform, and I intend to do just that by sending our brave soldiers on important missions around the globe from day one of my presidency. Im indispensable because of my commitment to the truth. Throughout my career, Ive always sought to stay close to the truth. I know that theres a lot of folks out there who say Im corrupt. But those who know me closest will tell you that this isnt the real Hillary. Ask those who know me best. Ask my husband Bill. Hell tell you. Ask my campaign chairman John Podesta. Hell tell you. Ask Lloyd Blankfein, CEO at Goldman Sachs. Hell tell you. Ask some of our closest allies in places like Saudi Arabia. Theyll tell you. They will all tell you about the real Hillary, and that my commitment to honesty and fighting corruption is second to none. It may even be my most exceptional quality. Alongside humility. Im also indispensable because of my network of alliances and supporters. You only have to look at who they are. Has there ever been a candidate in the entire history of our exceptional nation that has managed to get the backing of the entire media and corporate America? I dont think so. But it does tell you something, doesnt it? I humbly submit that it speaks volumes that some of the most important people in our exceptional country are prepared to place their trust in me. Im indispensable because, unlike Donald Trump, I dont need to rely on the help of people like Vladimir Putin and countries like Russia to help get me elected. Can you imagine me having to rely on Putin and Russia to get elected? Of course Ive had to bring Putin and Russia up in this campaign from time to time, not because I want to keep bringing Putin and Russia into it. In fact, the only reason Ive occasionally mentioned Putin and Russia is not because I want to keep talking about Putin and Russia, but because I have to keep taking about Putin and Russia because Trump is depending on Putin and Russia to get him elected and so I have to draw attention to Putin and Russia. But trust me, if I had my way I wouldnt bring Putin and Russia up at all. Im indispensable because of my commitment to helping countries get rid of their dictators, and establishing democracy and peace. Like Libya, for example. We came. We saw. He died. And the Libyans got their liberty. Most of all, Im  indispensable  and exceptional  because of my values. Take my commitment to human rights, which I have shown by being one of the most vocal supporters of a womans right to terminate her pregnancy, right up to a few seconds before the thing inside her becomes a human. Take my commitment to raising money, which my husband and I have shown through our tireless work with the Clinton Foundation, and in making hundreds of speeches for various organisations. Take my commitment to making the world a better place, which Ive shown time and time again by saying things like love trumps hate. Which it does, doesnt it? Im proud of that expression. But with all of these advantages comes  responsibility  I need to lead the world. You need me to lead the world. Because if I fail to lead, I will leave a vacuum that lets extremists, Putin and Russia, haters, bigots, the intolerant, Putin and Russia, the severely backwards , the Julian Assanges of this world,Putin and Russia  Baskets of Deplorables  take root everywhere. Of course, being exceptional doesnt mean that other people dont also have something to offer  maybe they do. But I have an unparalleled ability to be a force for peace, progress and prosperity around the world, which I intend to demonstrate on day one of my presidency, by standing up to Putin and Russia and showing Putin and Russia whos boss. Ill never stop doing good. Never. Thats what makes me great. Im good because Im great, and Ill tell you one thing, Ill never stop. Thats why Im indispensable. Lets keep me exceptional.

by Jon Rappoport, Activist Post : If Donald Trump can help her [Hillary] heal, then perhaps thats a good thing to do. Kellyanne Conway, former Trump campaign manager Donald Trump achieved two great things in his presidential campaign: he stopped Hillary Clinton from occupying the White House, and he ran against the media by attacking them mercilessly. Everything else is up for grabs. We will see. Already, he has made some errors. The appointment of Mike Pompeo as CIA director is a bad move. Pompeo, as a congressman, introduced the Dark Act, which now prevents the states from requiring GMO labels on food. And he favors the death sentence for Edward Snowden. Multiple media outlets are reporting that Trump will not attempt to prosecute Hillary Clinton. This is on the level of lowering the window shades for a vampire as dawn breaks. Hillary was certainly guilty in the email case, and the Clinton Foundation is a pay-for-play money laundering operation of global proportionsa private and parallel State Department, in which cash is the only standard for diplomacy. And these charges are mere low-hanging fruit on the Clinton crime family tree. Pursuing justice is supposed to be a Trump hallmark. Politics in the Matrix is a tap dance and a shuffle. Deals and compromises are made all the way along the line. Washington and its media allies suck their very life juices from those deals. Like some fungus, they thrive in the dark every-day corruption of This traded for That. In many ways, Trump exclaimed he was above the game. The deals he was going to make would all be on the side of benefiting Americaso he has a price to pay for asserting he was most definitely a different character on the political scene. That unbridled assertion was what drove huge numbers of people to show up at his rallies all over the country. They wanted an outsider who had a serious ax to grind with Washington and the media. They wanted him to be angry and outragedbecause they were, too. They didnt want a great healer, because justice comes before healing. Many of them had felt the effects of Globalism and its grotesque trade treaties. They were out of work, and he was going to bring back jobs. But that wasnt their only motivation. They knew their jobs had been stolen by anti-American elites, and they wanted the sword of justice to fall on those elites. They knew Hillary Clinton was an arch-Globalist. For these millions of Trump supporters, forgiving and forgetting and moving on isnt presidential. It smells bad. They were never part of the glazed-over New Age crowd, and they arent now. The cheese-glob coming together isnt in their lexicon. They dont view anger as a character defect or a compensatory response that traces back into early childhood. They want bad people to pay for their crimes. Hillary Clinton would be at the top of their list. Helping her heal is a sick joke. They want her in prison where she belongs. They know her constant vapid calls for national unity during the campaign were a straight-out con, a cover for her lust for power. They see nothing redeeming about her. Its simple: she fights the good and embraces evil. Therefore, she should be punished. Doing so would set an example and a course for the Trump administration: we dont back away, we dont back down. We arent separating campaign talk from presidential action. Were not trying to make that phony distinction. If Trump prosecuted Hillary to the full extent of the law, then of course the owls would come out hooting: hes vengeful; he cant let go; hes mean; hes spiteful; hes a cruel sadist; this goes beyond any civilized sense of propriety befitting a real leader. Yes? And? So? So what? Is Trump the same man now that he was when he was campaigning? Even asking that question seems nave, because of course we know all politicians rearrange themselves after they win a victory. But Trump portrayed himself as very, very different. He stood on that difference. He celebrated it. He reveled in it. He took great pleasure in it. Now, he has to pay the price. His supporters dont want to hear some garbled nonsense about how prosecuting Hillary would create a giant distraction from the job of leading the country. Trumps whole campaign was a distraction from politics as usual. Thats what gave him strength. Prosecuting Hillary Clinton now would be counter-intuitive and outrageous, and therefore it would be the most Trumpian thing Trump could do. It would give him more support from his millions of people. And it would be right and correct and it would deliver justice where justice has been needed for a very long time. And when the whole host of sordid details about Hillarys crimes came spilling out into the light, people who pride themselves on being in the camp of the beautiful and virtuous would realize who they have been defending. It would provide a valuable lesson, and the price of admittance to that show would trump the decades of waiting America has endured in the case of The People vs. Hillary Clinton. This case has now been canceled. Donald Trump achieved two great things in his presidential campaign: he stopped Hillary Clinton from occupying the White House, and he ran against the media by attacking them mercilessly. Failing to prosecute Hillary is not a great thing. It is a very bad thing.
As Donald Trumps election to the highest office of the land became inevitable on Tuesday night The Daily Sheeple reported that the Clinton campaign mysteriously went dark:THEY KNOW  NBC Reports Clinton Campaign Has Gone Completely Dark  No Longer Talking To Media #trump #hillary #itsover #election  The Daily Sheeple (@TheDailySheeple) November 9, 2016 Even Hillary herself must have know it was over, because she published a not-so-victorious Tweet to her supporters several hours before the official counts started being confirmed:This team has so much to be proud of. Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything. pic.twitter.com/x13iWOzILL  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 9, 2016 As confirmation of Trumps victory swept the world, many undoubtedly wondered what was going on in Hillarys mind. Then, as reports of a Clinton concession came to the forefront, it turned out that Hillary, in an unprecedented move for a losing Presidential candidate, refused to take the stage in front of thousands of distraught party goers who were expecting a coronation and fireworks show.Instead of Hillary, controversial campaign manager John Podesta took the stage to announce that the election wasnt over and that votes were still being counted, implying that Hillary would not concede.At that moment, we knew something was wrong:Is something wrong with Hillary? Has she had another health episode? https://t.co/yP3fYWpinL #trump #hillary #vote #2016 #hillaryhealth Had Hillary suffered another health episode? Was she so emotionally destroyed by the loss that she couldnt handle it mentally?It turns out, according to Ed Klein who spoke with a close friend and confidante of Hillary, that she did, in fact, have a serious breakdown and was in no condition to speak to America on live television.The shock of losing after having been a 98% lock for the Presidency was simply too much to bare. And as you might expect from a Clinton, it was everybody elses fault:Heres what I know, not my opinion. About 6:30 this morning she called an old friend. She was crying inconsolably. She couldnt stop crying. And her friend, her female friend from way, way back said it was even hard to understand what she was saying she was crying so hard. This is Hillary were talking about.Eventually her friend said she could make out that she was blaming James Comey, the Director of the FBI, for her loss, and, I dont understand exactly, the president of the United States for not doing enough.Via Gateway Pundit If all goes well, Hillary will be crying again when they put the handcuffs on her after President Trumps special prosecutor recommends charges, that is, so long as Trump didnt make a secret deal to let Hillary off the hook .
Read by 358 people This article was written by Brandon Smith and published at his Alt-Market.com site.   Make no mistake, there is an agenda at work here. You cant win for losing, or quit while youre ahead. Everything is quick sand, and one step forward two steps back. The world is stuck in a very tight trap, and it will require more than two dimensional thinking to find our way out of it. Electing Trump sent the right message to the powers that be, but the end result will be used to maneuver their next move against us. Nearly everyone is convinced of the need to reform the system, change things and somehow drain the swamp. But it seems that the complex of the system has a way of dragging people back down into it. This is a dangerous cycle of corruption, and one that will be very difficult to crawl out of, like a funnel. Stay on guard, and watch carefully at where the people win and where they lose in the next few scenes. World Suffers From Trump Shell Shock  Heres What Will Happen Next Ive been saying this for a long time, and Ill say it again here  in life there are only two kinds of people: those who know and those who dont. Some might claim there is a third option: those who dont want to know. In any case, if you want to be able to foresee geopolitical and social trends, you have to be one of the people who know. Above all else, in order to know you must be willing to step outside of the confusion and theater of the circus and look at developments from above. If you are biased and retain too many sacred cows you will never understand how the world works. You will be too busy trying to reinforce your own fantasies to see anything else. Beyond this, you must also understand that political and social developments are not random; they are either reactions to deliberate policies of special interests or they are driven by policies of special interests. Therefore, these developments are predictable and can be calculated (to a point). I usually refer to these special interests as global elites, or globalists, because that is how they often refer to themselves. The point is, most of the events you see in the political world are engineered events designed to elicit a specific psychological response from you and the people around you. You are not a human being to these people; you are either an asset to be molded or an obstacle to be disposed of. This is how our world works. Period. And until we fully understand this and accept it, things will never change. So, to be clear, if you understand the minds of globalists and understand what they want, you can understand the basic direction of the future. It is this philosophy which has allowed me to consistently and accurately predict geopolitical and economic events that very few other people have been able to predict. For example, I correctly predicted the Federal Reserve taper of QE , I predicted the inclusion of China in the IMFs Special Drawing Rights years in advance, I predicted the exact timing of the first Fed rate hike, I predicted the success of the Brexit referendum when most of the world and the liberty movement said it was never going to happen, I predicted that the Saudi 9/11 bill would pass , that Barack Obama would veto it and that congress would override his veto , I predicted that Hillary Clinton would be the Democratic candidate and that Donald Trump would be the Republican candidate for president of the U.S. and, for the past five months, I have been predicting that Donald Trump would win the 2016 election . People can either attribute these series of successful predictions to pure luck, or they can consider the possibility that I know what I am talking about. Ill leave that to them. The real issue, though, is not that my predictions were correct. What is more important is WHY they were correct. To begin with, I am often correct because it is a fact that globalists influence events. Globalists are human (at least partially); thus, they are predictable, making events predictable. If you can see from the perspective of a globalist, you will know what they want and what they are likely to do to get it. In a world without globalists I would have a hard time successfully predicting anything. I never make a cold prediction without a concrete rationale for why I hold that view. I always break down the reasons and evidence that bring sense to them. Some analysts might be content to simply flip a coin and make a call without explanation; I am not. As far as the Trump election win is concerned, this is what I said in June of this year :   Even if Trump is a legitimate anti-establishment conservative, his entry into the Oval Office will seal the deal on the economic collapse, and will serve the globalists well. The international banks need only pull the plug on any remaining life support to the existing market system and allow it to fully implode, all while blaming Trump and his conservative supporters. All of my predictions are rooted in a particular premise; that the global elites have been, since 2008 at least, deliberately setting the stage for an evolving international financial crisis greater than any other seen in modern history. This crisis is a means to an end. Globalists use one strategy above all others to achieve their goals  the Hegelian Dialectic; problem, reaction, solution. As I have documented for years, the elites openly call for the ultimate eradication of national sovereignty and the formation of a single world economy, a single world currency and, eventually, a single world government. In order to make this omelet, they intend to break a few eggs (and collapse a few economies). By blaming national sovereignty (and the people that defend it) for this crisis, they hope to convince the masses that the only practical solution is total centralization. You can read my in-depth analysis and evidence of this in my article  The Economic End Game Explained.  I also specifically predicted the Brexit and the Trump win based on another premise; that the elites are allowing conservative movements to take political power in certain regions, only to remove stimulus support from the global economy afterward. That is to say, I successfully predicted the Brexit and the Trump win because I understand and accept the reality that conservatives and liberty activists are not winning; we are being set up as scapegoats for a financial crash that the globalists already created. Again, people can either say I am lucky, or that there is something to my position, but the fact of the matter is I have been right and I will probably continue to be right. This brings us to what will happen going into 2017. The election of Donald Trump signals a sea change in not only global politics, but more importantly, global economic stability and social developments. As frenetic and insane as 2016 has been, 2017 will be drastically more chaotic. Some of these changes will be obvious, some of them will once again only be visible to a handful of people in the world. Lets start first with my happier predictions  The Death Of The Mainstream Media This is an easy one. The mainstream media, with its insane regressive-progressives and elitist bias, misrepresented the Alt-Right, the Trump campaign and anti-social justice movements during the entirety of the election process. Not only this, but through Wikileaks the leftist media was made naked as numerous journalists and outlets were exposed; colluding directly with the DNC and the Hillary campaign to first bushwhack Bernie Sanders and then rig debates and polling numbers to show Clinton in a farcically superior position to Trump. The mainstream media is now seen by the majority of Americans on the left and right as a lumbering rotting propaganda corpse that needs to be decapitated before it spreads its disease to anyone else. I predict MSM outlet readership and viewership (with the exception of FOX News) will collapse even further than it already has and that many outlets will be forced to consolidate until they fade out of existence. As I have said for years, the mainstream media is dead, they just dont know it yet. Well, after this election, everyone knows. The alternative media will take the place of the mainstream media. We will be adopting their viewership and growing explosively over the next year while they shrivel. They decided that their job was not to report the facts, but to manipulate public opinion. They are liars and a disgrace to true journalism. Good riddance. That said, some people will argue that my position that the elites wanted a Trump presidency is not tenable exactly because the liberal media worked so hard to rig public opinion against Trump. I will explain in my next article why these people are missing the bigger picture. The Crippling Of Social Justice Warriors The SJW cult is not dead, but it has been crippled. It is now a drooling bedridden quadriplegic eating its meals through a straw; a malfunctioning shell of a movement destined to be put out of its misery. When I think of social justice warriors I think of the Island of Misfit Toys; nobody wants these people. They are a detriment to everything they touch, including the Democratic party. It was the zealotry of SJWs that caused conservatives to rally in anger around Trump. It was they that awakened the sleeping giant. One reason I was so certain Clinton had set herself up for a loss was her insistence that the Democrats openly adopt these hell spawn and their ideology. By embracing politically correct rhetoric and accusing all opposition of being deplorable racists, sexists and homophobes, Clinton doomed her campaign from the very beginning. Anyone with any sense could see the massive tide against SJWs growing on the internet. In fact, I propose that the globalists, using the advanced web analytics at their disposal, saw it even before the rest of us did. SJWs are a tiny minority in American society. Their only strategy has been to use Alinsky tactics to make their movement appear much larger than it really is. Through mutual aid and elitist supporters in popular media, SJWs presented a fabricated consensus. They made it seem as though they were the majority view and, thus, the superior view. One fantastic result of the 2016 election has been the realization by conservatives that they are not isolated on the fringes of society. In fact, in America at least, we are a considerable force to be reckoned with. There is an old story of a Roman Senator 2,000 years ago who suggested the idea of forcing slaves to wear armbands to make them easily identifiable. Another senator admonished the notion, stating No, if they realize how many of them there really are, they may revolt. This is what Election 2016 did for conservatives  we have seen that millions of us have arm bands, and we are now in revolt. I rarely comment on race issues because I dont really see race as very relevant in most cases; but it has been the tactic of social justice cultists to constantly and brutally target straight white males as the monsters of history and therefore responsible for the ills and failures of every minority group from today to eternity. At this point I think it is safe to say that we will NO LONGER sit idly by as whipping boys for sad, deluded people clamoring for victim group status. The End Of Mainstream Polling I was also confident in my prediction of a Trump win based on my knowledge of inconsistencies in modern polling methods. The fact of the matter is, polling suffers from the same lack of objectivity that any other science can at times suffer from  the results will always be vulnerable to influence from the observer. If the observer wants a particular outcome for the numbers, they will consciously or unconsciously rig their method to produce the desired result. I saw this happen time and time again during the Brexit polls leading up to the referendum, and, as I stated many times before the U.S. election, the campaign polls seemed to be behaving the same way. This is how you get media sources like Reuters claiming a 90 percent chance of a win by Hillary Clinton just before the election. When pollsters weight their polls with far more democrats than republicans and when they poll the same groups repeatedly they are not going to get varied or honest data. In the end, polls become propaganda tools rather than litmus tests. The mainstream has tried desperately to explain why their polls were so utterly wrong, but it is too late for them. After the Brexit and the U.S. election, no one is going to trust these numbers again. Liberty Groups Will Get Some Breathing Room (For A Little While) The steady drum beat of government antagonism for patriot groups is probably going to subside for a short time. I happen to know that many militia groups and preparedness networks are breathing a heavy sigh of relief today after eight years of a hostile Obama presidency, the IRS sniping at liberty organizations and individual activists based purely on political zealotry, the DHS profiling liberty activists as terrorists and the SPLC frothing at the mouth like rabid animals looking to use their ties to the feds as a means to sink their teeth into any conservatives with the guts to refuse participation in the mainstream narrative. With conservatives launching into 2017 with complete control of government and a Trump mandate, it would seem that liberty groups have won the fight and have nothing to worry about. That said, dont get too comfortable, folks, because now we are going to discuss my negative predictions going into next year  The Final Stage Of Economic Collapse Economic collapse is a process, not a singular event; stock markets play only a minor part in this process. Most Americans only relation to the economy is through the daily rise and fall of the Dow Jones. If they see the Dow in the green, they go on with their day. If they see the Dow in the red, they stop and question what is happening. The election of Donald Trump has surprised many with a sudden rise, rather than fall, in stock markets. But, as I told my readers before the election, it would be wise to wait a couple of weeks before trying to analyze these markets because that is how long it will take just to absorb the election results. I predict first that central banks around the globe will further cut stimulus measures and that the Fed is now guaranteed to raise interest rates, probably in December before Trump even enters the White House. I also believe that the process of initiating a market crisis will take approximately six months to become widely visible to the public. As a consequence of the Fed pulling the plug on markets, I predict Trump and the Fed will enter into open hostilities against each other, which will erode international faith in the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency. By extension, Trumps presence in the White House will exacerbate already-existing tensions with Saudi Arabia. The Saudi 9/11 bill is just the beginning. As a result, I believe Saudi Arabia will dump the U.S. dollar as the petro-currency, influencing numerous other OPEC nations to do the same. I believe this will happen by early 2018. In my view, for now, oil prices will be the best indicator for where stocks are headed in the next few months. This is not something many Trump supporters want to hear. The response in the liberty movement to my prediction that the elites would allow Trump into office was rather predictable as well. In my article Why The U.S. Election Has The Entire World Confused I stated: I have not taken this position just to be contrary. If I think about it honestly, my position is truly a losing position. If I am mistaken and Clinton wins on the 8th then Ill probably never hear the end of it, but thats a risk that has to be taken, because what I see here is a move on the chess board that others are not considering. If Im wrong, then Im wrong. That said, if I am right, then I still lose, because Trump supporters and half the liberty movement will be so enraptured that they will probably ignore the greater issue  that Trump is the candidate the elites wanted all along. This seems to be the reaction from about half the liberty movement so far; a general blind faith and bias, clinging to the idea that the election (just like the Brexit) was a victory, and that conservatives had just won the culture war and defeated the globalists. Its funny how it wasnt much of a controversy when everyone thought I was wrong about Trump winning in the first place. There are two primary arguments that come up with these people. First, that my view on the influence of the elites is unrealistic and that the elites would have to be omnipotent in order to succeed in directing the outcome of these events so effectively. I will address this argument in detail in my next article on the Trump presidency and what the consequences will be for us all if Trump turns out not to be a constitutionalist. The second argument they present is that the elites will never succeed in blaming Trump and conservatives for an economic crisis that was decades in the making. To the people that embrace this argument I say  I understand mass psychology far better than you do. The reality is, half of America is ALREADY primed to blame Trump for everything that happens over the next four years (if we even make it that long). Possession is nine-tenths of the law in the minds of many. Beyond that, every meme in the global media and on the left is promoting the idea that Trump is an apocalypse in the making. Even Germanys Der Spiegal published its after-election magazine with a cover depicting Trumps head as a giant comet hurtling towards the Earth. Dont tell me that Trump cannot be blamed for an economic crisis. Only a complete idiot would suggest that he is anything other than the perfect scapegoat. At bottom, it does not matter whether people believe the above predictions or not. I have hundreds of emails from readers who called me a tinfoil hatter in the past and are now apologizing. So, if you plan to react in a knee-jerk fashion to the notion that Trump and conservatives are being set up by the elites for a final financial flagellation, be sure to write two letters  one for today saying Ive lost touch, and the other for tomorrow when you find out I was right once again.

Home  Gold  Gold Miners   The gold miners stocks have certainly had a wild ride this year. After initially skyrocketing out of deep secular lows into a mighty new bull market, they recently suffered a massive correction climaxing in an extreme plummet. This coincided with gold stocks major seasonal low in October. That heralds their strongest seasonal rally of the year heading into and through winter, a very bullish omen for coming months. Buy 2017 Silver Pandas at the Best Price Online Submitted by Adam Hamilton, Zeal: Gold-stock performance is highly seasonal , which certainly sounds odd. The gold miners produce and sell their metal at relatively-constant rates year-round, so the temporal journey through calendar months should be irrelevant. Based on these miners revenues, theres no reason investors should favor them more at certain times of the year than others. Yet history proves thats exactly what happens in this sector. Seasonality is the tendency for prices to exhibit recurring patterns at certain times during the calendar year. While seasonality doesnt drive price action, it quantifies annually-repeating behavior driven by sentiment, technicals, and fundamentals. We humans are creatures of habit and herd, which naturally colors our trading decisions. The calendar years passage affects the timing and intensity of buying and selling. Gold stocks exhibit strong seasonality because their price action mirrors that of their dominant primary driver, gold. Golds seasonality isnt driven by supply fluctuations like grown commodities experience, as its mined supply remains pretty steady all year long. Instead golds major seasonality is demand-driven , with global investment demand varying dramatically depending on the time within the calendar year. This gold seasonality is fueled by well-known income-cycle and cultural drivers of outsized gold demand from around the world. And the biggest seasonal surge of all is just now getting underway heading into winter. As the Indian-wedding-season gold-jewelry buying that fuels this metals big autumn rally winds down, the Western holiday season is ramping up. The holiday spirit puts everyone in the mood to spend money. Men splurge on vast amounts of gold jewelry for Christmas gifts for their wives, girlfriends, daughters, and mothers. The holidays are also a big engagement season, with Christmas Eve and New Years Eve being two of the biggest proposal nights of the year. Between a quarter and a third of the entire annual sales of jewelry stores come in November and December! And jewelry historically dominates overall gold demand. According to the World Gold Council, jewelry accounted for 58% of total global gold demand in 2014 and 57% in 2015. That works out to about 4/7ths of annual gold demand. The first half of 2016 proved a historic exception, as gold investment demand trumped jewelry demand for two consecutive quarters for the first time ever . Nevertheless jewelry demand still ran 40% even in H116s young investment-driven gold bull. This outsized Western jewelry buying heading into winter shifts to pure investment demand after year-end. Thats when Western investors figure out how much surplus income they earned during the prior year after bonuses and taxes. Some of this is plowed into gold in January, driving it higher. Finally the big winter gold rally climaxes in late February on major Chinese New Year gold buying flaring up over there. So during its bull-market years, gold has always tended to enjoy major winter rallies driven by these sequential episodes of outsized demand. Naturally the gold stocks follow gold higher, amplifying its gains due to their great profits leverage to the gold price. Today gold stocks are once again just heading into their strongest seasonal rally of the year driven by this robust winter gold demand . Thats super-bullish. Since its golds own demand-driven seasonality that fuels the gold stocks seasonality, thats logically the best place to start to understand whats likely coming. Price action is very different between bull and bear years, and gold is absolutely in a new bull market . Between the 6.1-year secular low it suffered in mid-December and early July, gold powered 29.9% higher easily exceeding that +20% new-bull threshold. Golds last mighty bull market ran from April 2001 to August 2011, where it soared 638.2% higher! And while gold consolidated high in 2012, that was technically a bull year too since gold just slid 18.8% at worst from its bull-market peak. Gold didnt enter formal bear-market territory at -20% until April 2013, thanks to the crazy stock-market levitation driven by extreme distortions from the Feds QE3 bond monetizations. So the modern bull-year seasonality relevant to this new bull year of 2016 ran from 2001 to 2012 , before the Fed-induced bear-market years between 2013 to 2015. This first chart distills down golds bull-year seasonal tendencies by averaging gold prices indexed within each calendar year. This methodology is essential because it renders price percentage moves perfectly comparable despite differing prevailing gold prices. Golds close on the final day of each preceding year is recast at a level of 100, with all the following years daily gold closes indexed off that. An indexed level of 110 simply means gold is up 10% year-to-date at that point. Each calendar years individually-indexed gold prices are then averaged together to arrive at this gold-bull seasonality. Gold has always had a strong tendency to enjoy major winter rallies . During its last bull-market years from 2001 to 2012, golds major winter rally started on average in late October . Technically golds major seasonal bottom averaged being carved on that months 16th trading day, which happened to be October 24th this year. From there gold surges into its strongest seasonal rally of the year. Between late October and late February in its last bull years, gold blasted 10.1% higher on average! These big winter-rally seasonal gains are much larger than the 4.3% and 7.5% averages seen in golds other major seasonal rallies in spring and autumn! That makes late October one of the best times of the year to deploy capital into gold. That Western holiday gold-jewelry buying fuels such outsized demand that November has long proved golds best calendar month of the year with average bull-year gains of 4.0%. While this bullish gold seasonality really moderates in December with an average 0.8% bull-year gain, it soon accelerates again in January on that surplus-income gold investment buying. The 2.7% average gain gold enjoyed in January during those bull years between 2001 to 2012 makes for this metals third best month of the calendar year. This winter-rally span is when gold enjoys its peak seasonal tailwinds . Unfortunately the great majority of speculators and investors remain wary of deploying into gold to ride its strong seasonal winter rally. Just like last year, the former are terrified of the next Fed rate hike once again arriving in mid-December. Gold-futures speculators in particular have spent recent years fooling themselves into believing Fed rates hikes are golds mortal nemesis, despite history proving that totally false . The record is crystal-clear, gold actually thrives during Fed-rate-hike cycles! Before todays there have been 11 since 1971, and gold has averaged impressive 26.9% gains across the exact spans of all these Fed-rate-hike cycles. In the majority 6 of these where gold actually rallied, its average gains were a staggering 61.0%! In the other 5 where gold retreated, its average losses were an asymmetrically-light 13.9%. Gold blasted higher during Fed-rate-hike cycles when they started with gold relatively low and unfolded at a gradual pace. Gold not only entered todays current farce of a rate-hike cycle at major secular lows, the Fed under uber-dove Janet Yellen has never been slower in raising rates. With at least an entire year between hikes, its hard to imagine any more gradual. This snail-like rate-hike setup is very bullish for gold . During its last rate-hike cycle between June 2004 to June 2006, the FOMC hiked at 17 consecutive meetings for a total of 425 basis points! That more than quintupled the federal-funds rate to 5.25%, an inconceivably-high level today. Even though that was an extremely-aggressive rate-hike cycle, gold still managed to power 49.6% higher over that exact span! Rate hikes are no threat to golds strong winter seasonals. Meanwhile investors remain distracted by the Feds ludicrous stock-market levitation, which is retarding gold investment demand. When stock markets remain near record highs and drenched in complacency, investors arent interested in prudently diversifying into gold. Since gold tends to move counter to the stock markets , investment demand only surges when stocks weaken. Thats what ignited 2016s gold bull. As the Feds surreal stock-market levitation cracked early this year, American stock investors flocked to gold via shares in the flagship GLD SPDR Gold Shares gold ETF. When they buy its shares faster than gold itself is being bought, this ETFs managers must issue sufficient new shares to offset all this excess demand and maintain gold tracking. The proceeds from these GLD-share sales are used to buy gold bullion. Thus GLD holdings builds show stock-market capital migrating into gold . In Q116, GLDs enormous 176.9-metric-ton build represented an incredible 80.6% of total worldwide demand growth in gold year-over-year. In Q216, GLDs 130.8t build accounted for a colossal 93.6% of the total global increase in gold demand! The reason golds bull stalled in Q316 is because GLDs holdings actually suffered a 2.1t draw. When these lofty Fed-levitated stock markets inevitably roll over again, differential GLD-share buying will surge again for prudent portfolio diversification into gold. That will really add to golds strong winter seasonals, amplifying its rally in the coming months. And golds strongest seasonal rally doesnt even need to be kick started by GLD demand resuming, as it relies on Novembers strong holiday gold-jewelry demand. So neither speculators Fed-rate-hike fears nor investors current apathy towards gold thanks to near-record stock markets are likely to short circuit golds strong winter rally this year. And if golds bull-market seasonals again prevail, thats super-bullish for gold stocks in the coming months. They also enjoy strong winter seasonals thanks to golds, because gold miners profitability and thus stock prices leverage golds price action. This next chart applies this same bull-market-seasonality methodology to the leading benchmark HUI NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index. Naturally gold-stock seasonals closely mirror golds, so the miners are also just entering their strongest seasonal rally of the year . On average in those last bull-market years from 2001 to 2012, the HUI powered a whopping 15.9% higher between late October and late February! Gold stocks strong 15.9% average winter rally bests their 13.7% and 15.0% rallies heading into spring and autumn. On average gold stocks major seasonal bottoming heading into their winter rally arrives on Octobers 15th trading day, which translates into October 21st this year. Like their primary driver gold, gold stocks tend to rally strongly in November, moderate in December, and then surge again in January and February. And given the sentimental, technical, and fundamental setups for gold stocks entering this years winter rally, the usual seasonal tailwinds are likely to help propel them much farther than usual . Just like gold and because of it, gold stocks entered a mighty new bull market early this year as well. Between mid-January and early August, they skyrocketed 182.2% higher in just 6.5 months! It was a wildly-profitable run. That left gold stocks overbought in the middle of summer, their weakest time of the year seasonally. So as I warned in early July, gold stocks record summer surge soon rolled over into a major correction. That quickly ballooned to massive proportions exceeding 20%, the threshold for new bear markets in general stocks. Then gold stocks started grinding higher again in September, but were slammed by gold futures in October. Early this month the HUI plummeted 10.1% in a single trading day, one of its worst losses ever, after gold-stock stops were run. That was sparked by cascading forced stop-loss selling in gold futures as gold slipped below $1300. By the time the dust settled, the gold stocks total correction per the HUI had mushroomed to a staggering 30.9% in 2.2 months! Such an enormous selloff naturally spawned great bearishness. So the gold stocks are now entering their seasonally-strongest period of the year universally despised and very low technically . These are screaming buy signals within ongoing bull markets, greatly upping the odds gold stocks next major upleg is just getting underway. Add the winter rallys strong seasonal tailwinds to exceptionally-bullish sentiment and technicals, and gold stocks coming gains should prove exceptional. The gold miners fundamentals also powerfully line up with the winter seasonal strength this year, really boosting the bullish outlook. These companies third-quarter operating results will be fully released by mid-November. And they are highly likely to reveal more big gains in operating profits despite golds recent weakness. Improving gold-mining fundamentals will entice in more investors, magnifying seasonal gains. Gold averaged $1185 in Q116 and $1259 in Q216. That 6.3% quarter-on-quarter gain in average gold prices led to enormous surges in operating profitability of the elite gold miners. They are represented by the leading gold-stock ETFs, the GDX VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF for the majors and its sister GDXJ VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF for the juniors. These ETFs component stocks are excellent. Each quarter I analyze the operating performances of the individual gold stocks included in these top ETFs. Their cash flows generated from operations are a great proxy for current profitability. In Q216 on that 6.3% average-gold-price increase, the top 34 component companies of GDX saw their operating cash flows surge 32.3% higher quarter-on-quarter. And GDXJs skyrocketed an incredible 51.1% higher QoQ! Q316s average gold price climbed another 6.0% QoQ from Q2 to $1334, despite golds big recent pullback. So those elite gold miners of GDX and GDXJ are very likely to soon report another major surge in operating profitability! It wouldnt surprise me to again see big gains approaching Q2s, which would certainly spark great trader interest. Improving fundamentals aligning with seasonals portends big upside. If the gold stocks were entering this winter-rally period drenched in greed after a powerful upleg, the seasonal tailwinds probably couldnt overcome the healthy correction tendency. If the gold miners fundamentals were deteriorating, that would likely prove too much heavy lifting for seasonals. But with the strong winter-rally seasonals aligning with very bullish sentiment, technicals, and fundamentals, gold stocks should surge. This last chart breaks down gold-stock seasonality into more-granular monthly forum. Each calendar month between 2001 to 2012 is individually indexed to 100 as of the previous months final close, and then all like calendar months indexes are averaged together. While this November-to-February winter-rally period doesnt encompass most of gold stocks strongest months, it does enjoy the most-consistent gains . On average in bull-market years, November enjoys the third-best gold-stock gains of the calendar year at 6.3% in HUI terms. Thats not far off the best months of May and August, which have averaged rallies of 6.9% and 6.7%. But unlike the flat-or-lower months surrounding those other strong months, November is followed by Decembers 2.3%, Januarys 2.7%, and Februarys 3.5% average bull-market-year gains. This unparalleled consistency is what makes gold stocks winter-rally seasonals so impressively strong. Continuing to march higher on balance ultimately yields better upside than the two-steps-higher-one-step-back action throughout the rest of the calendar year. There are no significant gold-stock selloffs in seasonal-average terms at all between November and February, which facilitates exceptional winter gains. Of course the standard seasonality caveat applies that these are mere tendencies , not primary drivers of gold or gold stocks. Seasonal tailwinds can be easily drowned out by bearish sentiment, technicals, and fundamentals. May and August this year are perfect cases in point. Instead of rallying 6.9% and 6.7% in line with seasonal averages in 2016, the HUI plunged 13.8% and 19.2% in May and August to shred seasonals! Seasonality doesnt always work, especially when it doesnt align with the primary drivers of sentiment, technicals, or fundamentals in that order. Gold stocks entered both May and August this year up at very-overbought levels, at new bull-market highs stretched far above the HUIs 200-day moving average. After rocketing 31.0% higher in April and surging up 11.2% in July, performance mean reversions were due. Gold stocks resulting massive correction in August bucked the seasonal trends. While September saw a 4.3% HUI gain in line with normal +4.8% bull-market seasonality, early Octobers plummet on stops being run was extremely excessive compared to normal October pullbacks. Thus gold stocks are unloved and oversold heading into this years winter-rally span, which is a super-bullish omen for outsized seasonal gains . The serious gold-stock upside coming as bullish sentiment, technicals, and fundamentals align with seasonal tailwinds can certainly be played with those popular GDX and GDXJ ETFs. But because they hold so many gold stocks, their gains can only pace the HUI at best. A carefully hand-picked portfolio of elite individual stocks with superior fundamentals will really amplify sector gains, dwarfing the ETFs performances.

Their big winter rally is fueled by golds own, which is driven first by outsized demand from holiday jewelry buying and later new-year investment buying. So both the metal and its miners stocks have strong tendencies to rally between late October and late February in bull-market years. Its the best calendar span to own gold stocks. And this years coming winter rally looks exceptionally bullish because the seasonal tailwinds wont be overpowered by bearish sentiment, technicals, or fundamentals. All of these primary drivers are bullish today and closely aligned with the strong seasonals, making for a powerful united force to propel gold stocks dramatically higher. Speculators and investors alike should be fully deployed for the coming months. Adam Hamilton, CPA On Sale At SD Bullion  This Week Only
 Posted on Home  Silver  Silver News   These two factors are clearly in play today as the metals move higher in a surge weve been expecting since late last week. However, these gains might just as quickly be reversed so there are a few indicators youd better be watching  From Craig Hemke, TFMetals : As mentioned in the title of this post, both physical demand and fear seem to be driving price today. How can we measure physical demand? Sometimes it shows up as a lack of overnight London Monkey trading. As prices were firming last week, we noticed this phenomena occurring again: http://www.tfmetalsreport.com/blog/7941/some-possible-encouragement And now look at the action overnight (earlier today) in London: Dont ask me to quantify this because I cant. This is pure conjecture based upon learned experience. As Ive followed this stuff daily for nearly seven years now, Ive noticed a clear correlation between London demand and the London Monkey daily price smash. And this clearly correlates with price trend. So, when The London Monkeys stand down as they have more than half the time the past two weeks this tells me that demand for physical is strong on London and, consequently, you can expect price to rise in New York, too. Also affecting things today is fear. This is the fear that Donald Trump is going to be the next president of The United States I guess. Why this is such a fear, I dont know. Perhaps, instead, a better word is uncertainty. The gold price is anticipating the uncertainty that a Trump victory would bring. Either way, when you get a 14-point turnaround in a major national poll just one week before the election, the effect is rather startling. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/01/post-abc-tracking-poll-clinton-falls-behind-trump-in-enthusiasm-but-has-edge-in-early-voting/ And its not just the metals. Weve been tracking the impending breakout and surge in Bitcoin, too, and its up 3% today and back through $700. Since the previous breakouts on this weekly chart added 40% or so to the Bitcoin price, Id say your next target is likely near $1000. Turning to the metals Just yesterday, we discussed the likelihood of a surge higher. Prices had found support at/near the respective 200-day MAs and, with copper surging higher, we thought that a move like were seeing today was coming. And while this is all very nice, well and good, we really havent accomplished anything significant until prices move back above the 50-day moving averages. Yes, silver never closed below its 200-day and gold is now more than 1% back above its own 200-day BUT if you want to reverse the recent downtrend and get the hot, momo-chasing Spec HFT algo money to come charging back into the synthetic paper gold derivative, then you need this move to extend up, to and through the 50-day. For the sake of clarity, the charts below show nothing but the location of the 50-day MA for both the Dec16 gold and Dec16 silver. THESE ARE THE KEY LEVELS TO WATCH. A move through and close above these levels should excite the algos and drive price even higher. So, watch them both very closely and be sure to note the sharp down angle of both, too. This makes the pressure to jump to and through even greater. Two other key indicators were going to be sure to keep watching are copper and the HUI. Copper is up another 1% as I type. This is the 7th consecutive up day and I have a last of $2.222. The HUI is also higher but not as much as you might hope/expect. Ive got it at 218 and up about 5.5 points. What should you be watching? Lets get copper to continue higher and move up and out of this pennant AND lets get the HUI back above 220. Both of these would help spur the metals even higher, too. Theres a lot more going on but I think Ill stop here so that we can get this posted for everyone. TF
 November 23, 2016  The 2016 presidential elections were more than an upset; they were a defining moment in American history. For the first time in living memory, the American people rose up in a united effort to throw off their political masters and show the politicians and media who really owns this country  We the People. There are many reasons why Donald Trump won the presidential election , and you can find articles galore proposing one theory or another. Of course, those articles are coming from people who are on the political right. For Democrats, the mainstream media and other liberals, the verdict is in; Trump won because of racism and sexism. In their world view, it would be impossible for anyone to beat out their anointed candidate, were it not for those isms and any other ism they can find. But the fact of the matter is that the average conservative or moderate rarely thinks about race, unless it is merely as a means of describing ones appearance. We might identify someone as Black or Hispanic, but in our minds, thats no different than saying that they are blond or brunette. Its merely a way of identifying the person, not as part of an ethnic minority or part of a group to hate, but merely as a person who looks a certain way. Yet to people who are focused on race (the true racists), the color of ones skin is everything. The ability to lump people in a group, because of their skin color, provides liberals with a way of dividing the country. Thus divided, it is easier for them to influence and control certain parts of it. The liberal cries of racism,sexism and islamophobia have become so common as to have dropped to the level of becoming a joke. Few, other than those who are already in the progressive liberal camp, even listen when those accusations come out. Rather, they see it as the lefts standard trump card, when they see that they are losing the argument. Somehow or other, a cry of racism beats out any argument in their minds, no matter what the facts or logic say about the issue at hand. Sadly, there are still way too many people who are willing to take that emotional argument and run with it; accepting that as their opinion on any person or issue, without thinking it through for themselves. Yet those political masters have just been slapped in the face by a thing called reality. While they regularly call themselves the majority and refer to conservatives as fringe, the recent elections prove otherwise. In fact, according to a poll by Pew Research, there are more conservatives in the country than there are liberals. Perhaps thats why Trump managed to beat Clinton, even though the media spent 18 months touting her as the next president. While there are many reasons why Trump beat Clinton, including the way the two candidates ran their campaigns and Hillarys many scandals, the crux of the matter boils down to mainstream Americans being tired of the last eight years of Obamas liberal agenda. Liberals like to claim that they represent the ideals of the majority of American citizens. Between outspoken Democrat politicians, the left-leaning mainstream media and the fact that liberals are much more likely to demonstrate when they dont like something, their argument is almost convincing. But this election proved them wrong. Not only did they lose the presidential election, but both houses of Congress are in Republican hands as well. What did all that? Basically, it boils down to progressive liberals pushing their agenda too hard and too fast. They have literally tried to change the social fabric of American society by force, rather than by more organic means. They overplayed their hand and this forced the silent majority to stand up and say Enough! and Ill have to say, they said it quite well. The liberals have lost control of two branches of our government, and over the next few years, well see them losing control over the third branch as well. As Trump has already presented the list of conservative judges he plans on picking from to fill Supreme Court vacancies, we can rest assured that liberals will not gain control of the Supreme Court anytime soon. This was probably the biggest issue at stake in this election. Had Hillary Clinton won the presidency, she would have been able to select the replacement for Justice Scalia, as well as two to four more Supreme Court Justices. That would give firm control of the Supreme Court to the liberals for the next 20 years or more. Does a Democrat Loss Mean That the Liberals Have Lost Their Steam? Does it mean the end of progressive liberalism as we know it? Are we finally going to see our country go back in a rational direction, returning to our roots? Sadly, no, in my opinion. Oh, the liberals have definitely been dealt a serious blow and their agenda has been slowed down. If Donald Trump is able to come through and fulfill his campaign promises, we might even see some serious reversals of liberal policies in the course of the next few years. But this doesnt mean an end to liberalism, merely a delay for them. Liberalism is alive and well, although at the moment theyre confused and crying. They will eventually get over their collective hissy fit and take a good look at the way things stand. If they can actually look beyond their own preconceived notions and see things as they are, they might even learn a few things about how the world works and come out stronger. They will be back and they will try to make us rue the day we voted Donald Trump into office. Democrats face two serious problems right now. The first is that they have lost their leadership. Part of the reason why Hillary Clinton became the Democrat Partys candidate for president, is that they didnt have anyone else who was a strong enough figure on a national level that they could put forth. Bernie Sanders was probably defeated more because he was an outsider, than any other reason. The Democrats never trusted him, because he wasnt one of them. He changed parties shortly before the primaries, just so that he could run as a Democrat, and once he lost the primaries, he left the Democrat Party and went back to being an independent. The Democrat Partys cupboard is pretty bare in the leadership department. Its serious enough that theyre going to have a challenge finding a candidate to float for the next presidential election. As soon as they get over their crying spell, theyre going to have to start working on that. The second problem that the Democrats have right now is a need to reevaluate their tactics and strategies. Even with pushing illegal immigration, allowing illegal aliens to vote, and massive amounts of voter fraud in at least 16 states, they lost the election. Worse than that, at least for the Democrats, is that the voter fraud theyve propagated during this election cycle has been so obvious, that people across the political spectrum are noticing. A national cry for cleaning up our voting process is rising up. While the means for doing that are still under hot debate, people are crying out for a honest, transparent process. The Democrat Party has already promised to fight President-elect Trump at every turn. Theyve actually threatened him, trying to tell him that he had better toe their line. That just shows how little they understand the man himself. Those threats, like all the other threats that have been made against him, will merely be exposed to the voting public and then ignored for the hot air that they are. The only chance that liberals have is to regain control of the White House or Congress. But thats not going to be easy. The legacy of Obamas overriding liberal agenda, manifested through his executive orders and massive regulations, is not going to be forgotten quickly. In fact, Id have to say that the greatest hope that the Democrat Party has right now, is that Republican lawmakers will invariably disregard the voting public. It might take several years for that to happen; but it will. Then, when it does, there will be another chance for the Democrats to preach their message of hope and change, this time, against an entrenched Republican Party. While that battle will be a hard one to win, I can almost guarantee you that it will be won. So the key now is for Congress and the President Elect to accomplish as much as they can, as quick as they can, to turn our country back towards its roots. That will probably all be undone eventually, but in the meantime, it will slow down the inevitable crawl to becoming a more and more liberal (read socialist) society. References:
There have been many prophets and seers throughout the ages with both wonderful and terrible predictions.Some of the greatest and most accurate prophecies we ever encountered comes from the words of french seer Michel de Nostredame, better known by his latin coverted name "Nostradamus".During the 16th century, he looked into the future and saw many great calamities engulfing the world, the world wars and even Donald Trump rising to power as President of the United States of America.Conspiracy theorists are going crazy about these predictions, one of these even speaks of the beginning of a great and terrible war ordered by the "false trumpet". It talks about Greece becoming a landmark for immigrants and refugees which has been a topic at the centre of Trump's candidacy . So what's gonna become of the world now?

Archives Michael On Television 10 Things That Every American Should Know About Donald Trumps Plan To Save The U.S. Economy By Michael Snyder, on September 15th, 2016 Can Donald Trump turn the U.S. economy around? This week Trump unveiled details of his new economic plan, and the mainstream media is having a field day criticizing it . But the truth is that we simply cannot afford to stay on the same path that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have us on right now. Millions of jobs are being shipped out of the country , the middle class is dying , poverty is exploding , millions of children in America dont have enough food , and our reckless spending has created the biggest debt bubble in the history of the planet . Something must be done or else we will continue to steamroll toward economic oblivion. So is Donald Trump the man for the hour? If you would like to read his full economic plan, you can find it on his official campaign website . His plan starts off by pointing out that this has been the weakest economic recovery since the Great Depression  Last weeks GDP report showed that the economy grew a mere 1.2% in the second quarter and 1.2% over the last year. Its the weakest recovery since the Great Depression  the predictable consequence of massive taxation, regulation, one-side trade deals and onerous energy restrictions. And Trump is exactly right about how weak this economic recovery has been. So how would he fix things? The following are 10 things that every American should know about Donald Trumps plan to save the U.S. economy  #1 Donald Trump would lower taxes on the middle class The tax savings under Trumps plan would actually be quite substantial for middle class families. The following numbers come from a recent Charisma article A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.  A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill.  Married couple earning $5 million per year with two children and $12,000 in child care expenses will get only a 3% reduction in their tax bill. #2 Donald Trump would lower taxes on businesses Under his plan, no business in America would be taxed more than 15 percent. Alternatively, Hillary Clintons plan would tax some small businesses at a rate of close to 50 percent. So Trumps plan would undoubtedly be good for businesses, and it would encourage many that have left the country to return. But where would the lost tax revenue be made up? #3 Childcare expenses would be exempt from taxation For working families with children this would be a great blessing. Without a doubt this is an effort to win over more working women, and this is a demographic that Trump has been struggling with. It is definitely an idea that I support, but once again where will the money come from to pay for this? #4 U.S. manufacturers will be allowed to immediately fully expense new plants and equipment This would undoubtedly lead to a boom in capital investment, but it would also reduce tax revenue. As an emergency measure this would be very good for encouraging manufacturers to stay in America , but it would also likely increase the budget deficit. #5 A temporary freeze on new regulations Red tape is one of my big pet peeves, and so I greatly applaud Trump for this proposal. I think that Bob Eschliman put it very well when he wrote the following about Trumps planned freeze on new regulations  In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Studies show that small manufacturers face more than three times the burden of the average U.S. business, and the hidden tax from ineffective regulations amounts to nearly $15,000 per U.S. household annually. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion dollars per year, and Trump will end it. #6 All existing regulations would be reviewed and unnecessary regulations would be eliminated In particular, Trumps plan would focus on getting rid of regulations that inhibit hiring. The following are some of the specific areas that he identifies on his official campaign website   The Environmental Protection Agencys Clean Power Plan, which forces investment in renewable energy at the expense of coal and natural gas, raising electricity rates; The EPAs Waters of the United States rule, which gives the EPA the ability to regulate the smallest streams on private land, limiting land use; and The Department of Interiors moratorium on coal mining permits, which put tens of thousands of coal miners out of work. #7 Donald Trump would fundamentally alter our trade relationships with the rest of the globe Donald Trump is the first major party nominee in decades to recognize that our trade deficit is absolutely killing our economy. I write about this all the time , and it is a hot button issue for me. So I definitely applaud Trump for proposing the following   Appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for America: narrowing our trade deficit, increasing domestic production, and getting a fair deal for our workers. Renegotiate NAFTA. Bring trade relief cases to the world trade organization. Label China a currency manipulator. Apply tariffs and duties to countries that cheat. Direct the Commerce Department to use all legal tools to respond to trade violations. #8 Donald Trumps plan would be a tremendous boost for the U.S. energy industry Barack Obama promised to kill the coal industry, and that is one of the few promises that he has actually kept. Obama also killed the Keystone Pipeline, and right now the energy industry as a whole is enduring their worst stretch since the last recession. To turn things around, Trump would do the following   Rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Save the coal industry and other industries threatened by Hillary Clintons extremist agenda. Ask Trans Canada to renew its permit application for the Keystone Pipeline. Make land in the Outer Continental Shelf available to produce oil and natural gas. Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius) and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs. #9 Trump would repeal Obamacare Trump claims that Obamacare would cost our economy two million jobs over the next ten years. And without a doubt, it has already cost the U.S. economy a lot of jobs . Not only that, but Obamacare has also sent health insurance premiums soaring, and this is putting a tremendous amount of financial pressure on many families. Trump says that he would replace Obamacare, but that is a rather vague statement. What exactly would he replace it with? #10 Trumps plan says nothing about the Federal Reserve This is a great concern, because the Federal Reserve has far more power over the economy than anyone else does. It is at the very heart of our debt-based system, and unless something is done about the Fed our debt bubble will continue to get even larger. Since the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen by more than 96 percent and our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger. For Trump to not even mention the Federal Reserve in his economic plan is a tremendous oversight. We are in the midst of a long-term economic decline, and things have not gotten better during the Obama years. If you can believe it, a study that was just released by Harvard even acknowledges thisAmericas economic performance peaked in the late 1990s, and erosion in crucial economic indicators such as the rate of economic growth, productivity growth, job growth, and investment began well before the Great Recession. Workforce participation, the proportion of Americans in the productive workforce, peaked in 1997. With fewer working-age men and women in the workforce, per-capita income for the U.S. is reduced. Median real household income has declined since 1999, with incomes stagnating across virtually all income levels. Despite a welcome jump in 2015, median household income remains below the peak attained in 1999, 17 years ago. Moreover, stagnating income and limited job prospects have disproportionately affected lower-income and lower-skilled Americans, leading inequality to rise. That same study found that the percentage of Americans participating in the labor force peaked back in 1997 and has been steadily declining since that time  If we continue to do the same things, we will continue to get the same results. Donald Trump is promising change, and many of his proposals sound good, but there are also some areas to be concerned about. Ultimately, just tinkering with the tax code and reducing regulations is not going to be enough to turn the U.S. economy around. We need a fundamental overhaul of our economic and financial systems, and Trumps plan stops well short of that. But without a doubt what he is proposing is vastly superior to Hillary Clintons plan, and so he should definitely be applauded for at least moving in the right direction. More Jobs Shipped Out Of The Country: Ford Moves All Small Car Production To Mexico  trump will have an accident but,but,but but ,but obammy mammy said Donald trump will never (ever) become president,his words ver batem.bawok also said Donald trump will never replace me in the WH,ominous ,disturbing words from el president,what exactly did baaaarak mean obamas red line 2.0 Obama did say trump will never become president,not on his watch,for him that was a red line,but lets face it we all know barrys track record when it comes to red lines lol JC Teecher It will only happen the way the Obominable One says it will happen, IF, the Creator on the Throne, says it will. barry oldwater Hopefully his changes will spur economic growth which will bring in more revenue as more jobs are created, not saying it will, just speculating that this is his plan. SnodtBlossom he wont be elected anonymous Nobody is elected, they are selected. Elections are just a way to keep dumb-downed masses in check. So keep voting Lazarovic Youre stupid, thats why youre anonymous. Coward too. anonymous You must be responding out of shameful ignorance. Its not your fault you are dumb-downed. It is ironic that you are calling me out for posting anonymously, when you are doing the same. Resorting to name calling though, really? LIZ THE SHIZ just like in Ancient Rome election season is bread and circus , keep the masses entertained so they wont notice theyre powerless and gullible BS1986 Shell use that in the debate. BS1986 he wants to be coronated , all hail Trumpus Maximus ThePeanut995 You are in for a rude awakening GSOB We all are, if either one is elected. Ive done my research. No choice is without risk. Trump is who Id like to see. Its time to think outside the box. If he gets in, perhaps in a 2nd term, the Fed Reserve gets axed. I cant stop thinking big with Mr. Trump. I cant stop thinking small with the leftist. GSOB With more than 50% leftist population .it does look like the final nail. Alan Cecil Bwah ha ha ha another twist on the trickle-down theory. It works great for the top 1%. hillery comin for your guns then theres hillerys economic plan, massive across the board tax increases,massive increases in the size of govt,staggering draw droppin deficits,massive increases in entitlements (handouts),after all she did say she was continuing beewok obambi failed policies Mondobeyondo I have never felt as depressed  about my own future, about the future of my friends, my family and my country- as I do at this very moment. William Lutz Mondo Im feeling the same way. Everyday the life is being sucked out of our wonderful nation with each passing day. Ive noticed it ever since the 2008 crisis, but even more so after Obama got reelected. The only thing we have to do now is hope for the best of our personal lives in the next few years. This downfall is inevitable. anonymous Youre not the only one. Jerry C Most of us felt that way almost 8 years ago. rat28 Another stupid tickle down economy by the GOP.. We should be taxing the rich . Obama regulation and energy policies protect us from global warming Obama health care help the poor and sick .. repealing Obamacare will hurt all the economy gains we seen the last 8 years.. Bad deal from Donald Trump. libs credit card economics yeah just let the 35 year old kids livin in their parents basement worry bout the 12T of red ink,and thats just in 8 years GSOB Which is impossible to pay off. South Texas The stupid in your comment just burns. Ive not met one person who is retired who has benefited from the wonders of Obummacare. Their cost went way up for less choice and service. Maybe you could go get a medical degree and offer our services for free and help out with the problem. As for GW, another money sucking joke pushed by scum who live in opulate homes and waste more energy than any working class family. Speaking of which, how big is your home? SnodtBlossom Sleep with Trump in 2016! BS1986 You do have your moments. LIZ THE SHIZ oh Snotty, you just want to rub your fingers through his thick blond weave, dont you SnodtBlossom What Im saying is.. If you vote for Trump and youre single and admit to voting for him,.. a lot of women wont want you. GSOB Let me be blunt  God called women into spiritual leadership roles, as an exception to His design, in order to shame the men into bringing the nation back to God, and into exercising their God given responsibility to lead in the church, the home and in the nation. In no way does the Bible EVER paint women in leadership roles as a positive thing, but it is something God uses to shame the men into action. SnodtBlossom Be SHAMED.. be very SHAMED G SOB LIZ THE SHIZ and you wonder why your single LIZ THE SHIZ but theyll be the ugly women, not the mindless bleach blond Fox News types Satirist 1976 Michael this is one of the best articles you have ever written. You presented Trumps solutions to issues that plague everyday Americans. Well done. This is not satire. Trump should replace Ocare with the free market and nothing else. William Lutz Replace Obamacare with individual Health Savings Accounts based on investments. Public hospitals with vouchers is also a great idea. South Texas No, the government needs to get out of looting me with a savings account and make it free market all the way. GSOB You dont understand how it works. They dont tax those dollars you put into a HSA. Orange Jean Except that in most of them  you select a certain $$ amount each year  and if you dont use it, you lose it. Who do you think ends up with the money then? GSOB Dont expect a reward for being careless. No system can sustain carelessness South Texas Exactly my point. Why do we have to put up with some over compensated elected person to let me do something with my money? Ive never had a use for an HSA but known people who do. But hey, at least the scum implicitly acknowledge they are cheating us by giving us the privilege to use our money pre-tax. If some of us were not working almost 5 months of the year to support government and we had a real private health insurance and health care sector, this would be a non issue. SnodtBlossom Hillary will win Peanut NO SHE WONT   HE IS NOW NECK AND NECK WITH HER AND WILL EXCEED HER  MORE STUFF ABOUT HER WILL BE COMING OUT! SnodtBlossom How much prior political experience does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! He talks the talk, but never walked the walk. But hey.. its only THE PRESIDENCY! Maybe next well grab people off the street w/no medical training to do surgery! Neither did Ulysses Grant or Dwight Eisenhower have a prior politcal position, though both had a strong military background. Dwight being  The Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War II and Grant Commanding General of the United States Army How much military background does Trump have? NADA!!! ZIP!!!! ZILCH!!! ZERO!!! no major U.S. company has filed for Chapter 11 more than Trumps casino empire in the last 30 years. He has filed four business bankruptcies. Maybe he thinks its just as easy to file bankruptcy w/the entire government and walk away. Raymond Chow Political experience means nothing especially when someones political experience means the detriment of the nation. Cobbett How much prior political experience does Trump have Oh yes theres Iraq, Libya, Syria(she was also instrumental in convincing Bill to bomb Serbia .all resounding success stories politics just equal BS. turee60 How much military experience does Hillary and Obama have zilch none! jonodough you mean like the idiot obama? Mondobeyondo If she doesnt have a coughing epileptic seizure before the election. LIZ THE SHIZ yup, the fix is in just watch the electoral college , your vote dont mean squat!!! GSOB Not yet it dont Raymond Chow Why do people always mention electoral college when they dont understand what electoral college is? When looking at the map of blue or red those are just projections where Democrats or Republican voted favorably in the past it doesnt mean electoral college. Electoral college delegates are pick by the winning candidate in the state. All states in the national election are winner take all. So if the candidate wins in majority of the district in the state he wins all the state electoral college. LIZ THE SHIZ just like super delegates, seems fishy budman nebraska is not winner take all. each congressional districts electoral vote depends on the vote within that district. GSOB And the minimum wage will go up. And unemployment will rise, and government will spend even more. Orange Jean   yeah, and little pink pigs will fly away from Smithfield Foods and not get turned into hams! ISA41:10 Yep! krinks Hey Genius. A Free Market solution led people to be denied coverage for nearly every malady under the guise of a pre existing condition. A Whistle Blower for/from the Health Insurance Industry admitted as much. The more she came up with creative reasons to deny payment/coverage the higher she was promoted. GSOB The free market is the best thing going! Because it has some level of risk, non hackers despise and envy this good system. What makes it good is that it benefits the majority of the people, not all. No system can. What happens if the majority are non hackers? Non hackers default to handout mode by finding fault with reality and cry, they depend on a leftist government to provide a silver spoon for everyone. The market then is no longer free. krinks Werent you paying attention? They take your premiums and then when you need to use it deny payment. GSOB Appeal it then. krinks Appeal? To who? The same person who gets a bigger bonus for telling you no? Are you an idiot? GSOB You sound like a confident young man. Just ignore me. Stick with your leftist ideas. Your choice. Jace Tate the once estudious michael snider is now drowned by drivel. LIZ THE SHIZ well he opened it up to a Trollathon Raymond Chow When people runs out of argument or loses they start calling names which is exactly what you are. Yes, you sue or appeal your case. krinks I explained that a big bonus follows when you tell people NO in the private industry. If you dont understand this YES you are an IDIOT. Jerry C Then payers should be free to leave and go to a provider who says yes in a fair market. LIZ THE SHIZ meanwhile you die waiting for the appeal Raymond Chow Then sue them or perhaps you didnt sign up for the coverage. Its like you got liability for your car insurance but you wanna be cover for medical when you get into an accident. joe Thats how insurance works. Simply banking in reverse and how the inventors, IE banksters intended. Raymond Chow Yes, a free market system where you can acquire health insurance across state boundaries. I.e., wish to buy health insurance in Iowa where its lower even though I live in California. Cobbett Why are people so obsessed with their health? Why paying endless 10000s on the chance I might get ill rather spend it on women and booze. Lillian DeVore I think its more of an obsession with the pre-existing conditions peoples health. Cobbett I had my appendix whipped out when I was 14(some time ago) even though Im a heavy boozer(although not now) I Feel Fine. Why worry what will be will be. GeneP54 He should, but he said that he wants universal healthcare. turee60 I agree our medical the way it was was still the best in the world. People from Canada were coming here for medical cause it was so much better. The government doesnt need to get into our medical. Years ago like in 1986 I was out of work and had no medical and went to a free clinic in my area and got waited on quickly and it didnt cost me anything. William Lutz I agree. On one hand, some of Trumps policies sound alright, but a lot of his proposals are dubious and a few are unrealistic. First of all, building a YUGE wall on the border is going to be very expensive and not very effective. Furthermore: 1) He never really mentions how he is going to deal with Planned Parenthood. 2) He obviously has no full intention of abolishing some bureaucratic agencies such as the Fed Reserve, the FDA, the USDA, Department of Energy, etc. 3) Reckless spending and debt is going to continue, and tax revenue will never keep up with the expenses. 4) I am not sure how he is going to replace Obamacare. 5) His idea on how to combat ISIS is not practical. It would mean extorting the Middle East out of their oil and having a costly militarist operation in various countries. Its a recipe for World War 3. 6) Even though he is anti establismhment at heart, he is running on a major party platform, which is rigged and corrupt. He shouldve refused to participate within the Republican Party and join an alternative political party. Jace Tate Isis took the oil didnt they William Lutz Yeah they probably took it, but my point is that you dont easily defeat ISIS by confiscating the oil and having a double version of the Iraq War. By the way, I forgot to mention that DJ Trump never spoke openly about civil liberties or mass surveillance either. Hence, I suspect that he will strengthen the so called war on terror, which God forbid he would do. No more George Dubya Bush please. Christopher Privett Obama expanded Bushs programs of surveillance, and just paid Mexico 75 Million dollars. For a WALL built across their southern border. John Francis You are right, some things dont add up, but Ill take him over Hillary any day of the week. Im still struggling with whether to vote in the presidential at all, having a very hard time with Trumps torture advocacy and his call for the execution of Edward Snowden. Jessy Scholl Seriously, Donald Trump cant talk about abolishing federal agencies because he would be killed on the spot. Jace Tate how are lower taxes going to help zero growth? How is income in the middle class going to aid the systems recovery? Once you go off the cliff of a set system in a fixed economy, you dont think there is any fixing it. I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer. However the way the apple is peeled can only be determined post collapse, after the decision makers have decided the direction the country takes. That is why even if you take out the true deplorables ruining everything, the best you can do is elect someone who identifies with the American way of life and our decisions. themacabre How are higher taxes for failed government programs going to help? we need to cut federal spending not give it more money. Thats like giving a lazy bum watching tv and drinking beer another six pack. ISA41:10  I think higher taxes and lower barriers to growth are the answer.  How stupid can you be?!?!? Explain to me how taking more money from the private sector (businesses and people) improves growth and the economy? Waiting .. JC Teecher You are proof of how well mind control by the elite liberals is working. It is this mentality that is meant to destroy the God induced US Constitution. When a nation has allowed four scotus to take the whole nation down a rat hole of sin, then the nation either digs back out or it gets drowned in darkness. There is a slim very slim chance that America can dig out of the rat hole for a few years, but ultimately sin will drown this nation into the abyss. Dont believe it? It is in the book; the only book that matters. sister soldier Amen and amen again. LIZ THE SHIZ we will wind up with a one world government just like in Star Trek Next Generation , the united federation of planets GSOB Leftist 1. A member of an ideological camp that defines socialism as a form of totalitarian secular feudalism; an advocate for the management of non-Leftist people as farm animals. When the Leftist tried to convince me that North Korea had the only true and just form of socialism on earth, I gave up on trying to talk rationally with him and just walked away. Jace Tate if you would all stop patting each other on the back youd find the diversity among yourselves deplorable in the face of true knowledge. Jace Tate you changed your comment you liberal demagogues. William Lutz But I give Donald credit where its due. At least he is better than Hillary and not as conniving and deceiving as she is. However, I refuse to pick the least of two bad apples. GSOB .. vizeet Removing Obamacare and reducing Defense budget will be huge saving for US. And will be good for rest of the world . William Lutz Trump however, will not reduce military spending and his idea of replacing ACA is only a secret plan. SnodtBlossom Do you think he will help you when you are homeless? GSOB It is not the POTUS job to do that. LIZ THE SHIZ if he has any rooms empty in his crappy hotels he can rent them to the homeless and get refunded through section 8 housing Raymond Chow You cant even afford to step into his hotel lobby. I dont think they allow vagrants there. sister soldier Didnt the current sitting president already reduce the defense budget? My bad . he reduced our defenses. turee60 You cant reduce the defense budget you need to raise the defense to protect our country from terrorist! Ye Deplorable Uncucker I would hope that after he is elected he will go after the Fed. Shut them down. Paleface and let the treasury print the US$. that way avoiding paying interest to a private bunch of parasites. LIZ THE SHIZ ask JFK what happens when you try to go after the fed, you cant can you?

Archives Michael On Television 22 Reasons Why Starting World War 3 In The Middle East Is A Really Bad Idea By Michael Snyder, on August 27th, 2013 While most of the country is obsessing over Miley Cyrus , the Obama administration is preparing a military attack against Syria which has the potential of starting World War 3. In fact, it is being reported that cruise missile strikes could begin  as early as Thursday . The Obama administration is pledging that the strikes will be limited, but what happens when the Syrians fight back? What happens if they sink a U.S. naval vessel or they have agents start hitting targets inside the United States? Then we would have a full-blown war on our hands. And what happens if the Syrians decide to retaliate by hitting Israel? If Syrian missiles start raining down on Tel Aviv, Israel will be extremely tempted to absolutely flatten Damascus, and they are more than capable of doing precisely that. And of course Hezbollah and Iran are not likely to just sit idly by as their close ally Syria is battered into oblivion. We are looking at a scenario where the entire Middle East could be set aflame, and that might only be just the beginning. Russia and China are sternly warning the U.S. government not to get involved in Syria, and by starting a war with Syria we will do an extraordinary amount of damage to our relationships with those two global superpowers. Could this be the beginning of a chain of events that could eventually lead to a massive global conflict with Russia and China on one side and the United States on the other? Of course it will not happen immediately, but I fear that what is happening now is setting the stage for some really bad things. The following are 22 reasons why starting World War 3 in the Middle East is a really bad idea  #1 The American people are overwhelmingly against going to war with Syria  Americans strongly oppose U.S. intervention in Syrias civil war and believe Washington should stay out of the conflict even if reports that Syrias government used deadly chemicals to attack civilians are confirmed, a Reuters/Ipsos poll says. About 60 percent of Americans surveyed said the United States should not intervene in Syrias civil war, while just 9 percent thought President Barack Obama should act. #2 At this point, a war in Syria is even more unpopular with the American people than Congress is . #3 The Obama administration has not gotten approval to go to war with Syria from Congress as the U.S. Constitution requires . #4 The United States does not have the approval of the United Nations to attack Syria and it is not going to be getting it. #5 Syria has said that it will use  all means available  to defend itself if the United States attacks. Would that include terror attacks in the United States itself? #6 Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem made the following statement on TuesdayWe have two options: either to surrender, or to defend ourselves with the means at our disposal. The second choice is the best: we will defend ourselves #7 Russia has just sent their most advanced anti-ship missiles to Syria. What do you think would happen if images of sinking U.S. naval vessels were to come flashing across our television screens? #8 When the United States attacks Syria, there is a very good chance that Syria will attack Israel. Just check out what one Syrian official said recentlyA member of the Syrian Baath national council Halef al-Muftah, until recently the Syrian propaganda ministers aide, said on Monday that Damascus views Israel as behind the aggression and therefore it will come under fire should Syria be attacked by the United States. In an interview for the American radio station Sawa in Arabic, President Bashar Assads fellow party member said: We have strategic weapons and we can retaliate. Essentially, the strategic weapons are aimed at Israel. Al-Muftah stressed that the USs threats will not influence the Syrain regime and added that If the US or Israel err through aggression and exploit the chemical issue, the region will go up in endless flames, affecting not only the areas security, but the worlds. #9 If Syria attacks Israel, the consequences could be absolutely catastrophic. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is promising that any attack will be responded to  forcefullyWe are not a party to this civil war in Syria but if we identify any attempt to attack us we will respond and we will respond forcefully #10 Hezbollah will likely do whatever it can to fight for the survival of the Assad regime. That could include striking targets inside both the United States and Israel. #11 Irans closest ally is Syria. Will Iran sit idly by as their closest ally is removed from the chessboard? #12 Starting a war with Syria will cause significant damage to our relationship with Russia. On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin said that the West is acting like a  monkey with a hand grenade . #13 Starting a war with Syria will cause significant damage to our relationship with China. And what will happen if the Chinese decide to start dumping the massive amount of U.S. debt that it is holding? Interest rates would absolutely skyrocket and we would rapidly be facing a nightmare scenario . #14 Dr. Jerome Corsi and Walid Shoebat have compiled some startling evidence that it was actually the Syrian rebels that the U.S. is supporting that were responsible for the chemical weapons attack that is being used as justification to go to war with Syria  With the assistance of former PLO member and native Arabic-speaker Walid Shoebat, WND has assembled evidence from various Middle Eastern sources that cast doubt on Obama administration claims the Assad government is responsible for last weeks attack. You can examine the evidence for yourself right here . #15 As Pat Buchanan recently noted, it would have made absolutely no sense for the Assad regime to use chemical weapons on defenseless women and children. The only people who would benefit from such an attack would be the rebels  The basic question that needs to be asked about this horrific attack on civilians, which appears to be gas related, is: Cui bono? To whose benefit would the use of nerve gas on Syrian women and children redound? Certainly not Assads, as we can see from the furor and threats against him that the use of gas has produced. The sole beneficiary of this apparent use of poison gas against civilians in rebel-held territory appears to be the rebels, who have long sought to have us come in and fight their war. #16 If the Saudis really want to topple the Assad regime , they should do it themselves. They should not expect the United States to do their dirty work for them. #17 A former commander of U.S. Central Command has said that a U.S. attack on Syria would result in  a full-throated, very, very serious war . #18 A war in the Middle East will be bad for the financial markets. The Dow was down about 170 points today and concern about war with Syria was the primary reason. #19 A war in the Middle East will cause the price of oil to go up. On Tuesday, the price of U.S. oil rose to about $109 a barrel. #20 There is no way in the world that the U.S. government should be backing the Syrian rebels. As I discussed a few days ago , the rebels have pledged loyalty to al-Qaeda , they have beheaded numerous Christians and they have massacred entire Christian villages . If the U.S. government helps these lunatics take power in Syria it will be a complete and utter disaster. #21 A lot of innocent civilians inside Syria will end up getting killed. Already, a lot of Syrians are expressing concern about what foreign intervention will mean for them and their families  Ive always been a supporter of foreign intervention, but now that it seems like a reality, Ive been worrying that my family could be hurt or killed, said one woman, Zaina, who opposes Assad. Im afraid of a military strike now. The big fear is that theyll make the same mistakes they made in Libya and Iraq, said Ziyad, a man in his 50s. Theyll hit civilian targets, and then theyll cry that it was by mistake, but well get killed in the thousands. #22 If the U.S. government insists on going to war with Syria without the approval of the American people, the U.S. Congress or the United Nations, we are going to lose a lot of friends and a lot of credibility around the globe. It truly is a sad day when Russia looks like the good guys and we look like the bad guys. What good could possibly come out of getting involved in Syria? As I wrote about the other day , the rebels that Obama is backing are rabidly anti-Christian, rabidly anti-Israel and rabidly anti-western. If they take control of Syria, that nation will be far more unstable and far more of a hotbed for terrorism than it is now. And the downside of getting involved in Syria is absolutely enormous. Syria, Iran and Hezbollah all have agents inside this country, and if they decide to start blowing stuff up that will wake up the American people to the horror of war really quick. And by attacking Syria, the United States could cause a major regional war to erupt in the Middle East which could eventually lead to World War 3. I dont know about you, but I think that starting World War 3 in the Middle East is a really bad idea. Let us hope that cooler heads prevail before things spin totally out of control. It Is Illegal To Feed The Homeless In Cities All Over The United States  Boo-urns There is no need for a *world* war. Just let them all kill each other; the sooner the world is free from the idiocy that abounds throughout the entire middle east  including Israel  the better off the rest of us will be. 2Gary2 Does anyone out there see this ending well? Michael Rodster The US and its Allies dont care what happens in the Middle East. In fact its my view that they would prefer absolute chaos and a full blown out war. As the mantra in 1992 Elections Its all about the economy stupid. And the same applies here as well. This is all desperation as the US knows whats coming economically. If they can ramp up their Military Industrial Complex it could help boost the economy. That is the primary business the US is in. Its all about war and spying. I do hate constantly repeating the man but its needed here as well. This all played out during the Great Depression except this time all the fiat based currency nations are in the same boat as the US and this time they have nukes Trade wars, Currency wars, World wars Gerald Celente Adrian On the contrary, a few may benefit the CEOS and huge shareholders of Halliburton, Ratheon, etc but the economy would be hurt by threats to oil, decreased stability in the ME, and so on. They dont care about the economy, if they did they would have implemented stark programs to bring millions back to work. Instead, its been business as usual with downsizing, QE 2,3, 4, and shipping jobs overseas. davidmpark No. It wont.

I have said this before. The train is just about to go over the cliff. lavista4u Yes. true I believe its a distraction. September is Illuminati New year and they do some crap during the Month of September like 911  What is coming to Americans next month could be 100 times worse than what they would do to Syrians. Americans needs to be more prepared and ready than Syrians it seems  It could be a distraction to cause chaos in America. They know no one wants war in America and even lame stream is publishing that story and 99% of comments on main stream news sites like CNN is against war . I believe America is their next target not Syria even though they are making it look like its Syria and Iran .

I think this October we will have our eyes opened. This train is in full speed. I have been stocking up for the last 2 years on food, ammo and sanitation. The biggest problem I have run into is income and cost of ammo. The ammo price has come down and some sites are catching up (midland and foxtrotgear seem to be the best prices). The ammo shortage hurt the last year, but my income seems like it has dwindled over the last 2 years. Josh It has been a rough couple of months. I always check ammoseek and it seems like bulk ammo and foxtrotgear have the best bulk prices. Dont forget sanitation, food and medical. Keep your powder dry.

Economy collapse is inevitable. To hold it over, U.S. needs to seed unstability and war in other countries.

Congress needs to move to stop Obama as this is enough to prove he and his entourage are incapable of ensuring the welfare of the United States.

Some are as old as 40 years. davidmpark If you are worried about gas attacks, you can make a filter for an air conditioning unit. First, get all of the supplies you can: a lot of baking soda and wood charcoal (not briquettes), piece of wood, a scale (any kind), a large pot, 2 pillow cases, a plastic or metal box, and duct tape. Pour the baking soda into a pot and weigh it. After recording the weight, place on heat source and cook it for a few minutes. Remove and re-weigh, then repeat. When the scale no longer shows change in weight, pour the powder into a pillowcase and make more if necessary to fill to pillowcase about half way or more. This process converts the sodium bicarbonate into sodium carbonate (soda ash, or activated carbon). Now pour the charcoal onto the pot and use a piece of wood to crush the charcoal into smaller pieces, about the size of wheat grains. Pour into pillow case and make more if necessary to fill to pillowcase about half way or more. Some dust will fall out  let it. Now, drill or cut two holes big enough to snuggly fit the air intake hose of your A/C unit into the plastic or metal box on the shorter sides. Place the bag of soda ash on one side, the bag of charcoal on the other side. Seal with duct tape generously. Now attach the air intake hoses of your A/C unit on the unit with the air entering the charcoal first, and the soda ash second. Duct tape generously on both ends. We built this last year when the ash and smoke from local wildfires were choking the air around us. We were supremely comfortable with filtered air. Will it work for chemical weapons? The soda ash is the same ingredient used in gas masks, but I really dont know. Works great for smoke and ash, and chili cook-offs, but I have no real data that it will work for WMDs.

Gay Veteran we will all be disappointed, because there is NO difference between the 2 parties Ralfine All people have the government they deserve. Syrin Heres how this could play out. We invade Syria. Its a leaping point to go to war with Iran who has already threatened war with Israel if we invade. Obama will sign the UN Small Arms Treaty, and Russian troops have already been training on US soil for over a year to disarm Americans. I believe they will stage some false flag event in FEMA region 3 which has been urgently stockpiling by no later than October 1  according to all their requests for supplies. (do a search, they are stockpiling a A ton in FEMA region 3) Martial law will be declared enforced by our militarized polive, some Iranian patsy will be blamed, and they will jump from Syria to Iran. Obama had a behind the scenes meeting with the highest level financial people in the US last week. The last time this happened, they took out gold. I think they will use the war and false flag events to perform a simultaneous engineered collapse of the economy because they know we cannot recover from our debt burden hoping the no information GARY voters will blame the evil Syrians for our economic problems. Just like Nazzzi Germany, we become a dictatorship overnight. davidmpark Okay, I looked it up about the stockpiling for region 3. That makes good sense to concentrate around there for the sake of the powers in DC. Theyd want to make sure they dont have any disruptions in their cocktail parties and lasciviousness. They stockpiled around the furherbunker during the battle for Berlin. Makes sense to do that sort of thing when they make unpopular and more blatant illegal actions against their own people. K Excellent comment. The idea behind Russian troops was, it would be easier to get them to fire on civilians.

No more discretionary spending on music, entertainment, parties, etc. Sure, it will occur, but a tenth of what is evident now. The boards, extra houses, luxuries, will no longer be part of life. Maybe not so bad. Roving bands of gangs and criminals will be put down by law abiding citizens with guns. People will no longer accept crime. Bring back the death penalty and frontier justice. It is coming. The I was disadvantages growing up will only get a bullet in the head. The nation will no longer be able to afford and tolerate the rape of society. Healthcare will be a disaster. Obama and the Left will blame it on the GOP but that will only work for the hardcore remnant of his supporters. The rest of the nation will marvel at its stupidity for not pushing back sooner. But they will realize the system has been so destroyed that it will take years to bring back what we had. WHERE TO STOP? It is so obvious.

By Covert GeopoliticsWe have been very, very suspicious of Donald Trump since he began his political run.Many believed he was an outsider who was our only hope to tame the US federal government beast. But it has become very clear he is not.First, Wikileaks showed that Killary herself actually approved Trump to be her competitor. According to an email sent from an assistant at the Clinton campaign, Hillary was aware that Trump was going to run before the political process was fully underway.Clinton advised the mainstream media to push his legitimacy as a pied piper candidate because she realized, after looking at the poll numbers, that she wouldnt stand a chance at winning the presidency against any of the establishment republicans without making them pied pipers  it just so happened that Donald was the easiest to play the role considering his long history of friendship with the Clintons.In addition, the mainstream media was more than complicit in creating a narrative that the 2016 presidential elections were about Hillary Clinton vs Donald Trump from the get go.But, barely reported in the media, was that after the 3rd presidential debate, Clinton and Trump went out for a night on the town together  and where they went is of great interest.They went to an annual Jesuit function which is usually full of New World Order types.THE JESUITS One of the more interesting things that occurred right at the end of the Jubilee year in early October, was that the Jesuits installed a new Superior General, with the date to commence being actually at midnight on the end of Jubilee.We found this interesting because there is plenty of evidence that the Jesuits are at least one major arm of what you can call the illuminati.In fact, the Jesuits were founded in Spain by what various reports call crypto Jews  those who are Jewish but pretending to be Catholic. Certainly at that time in Spain it was safer not to be a Jew.Even Wikipedia, which wouldnt recognize a conspiracy if it were directly presented by its participants has this to say about the Jesuits:At the beginning of the Al Smith dinner party after Cardinal Dolan was introduced, a joke was even made by a speaker that everyone in attendance is doing their part in supporting their charitable efforts and that it couldnt be done without the support of many of the other devoted Catholics on stage like Henry Kissinger, Howard Rubenstein, and Mort Zuckerman  all of whom are obviously Jewish so this remark was naturally met with a lot of laughter In fact, an extraordinary amount of controversy swirls around Jesuits. They are said to constitute the Black Church and thus adhere to the same Satanic religion as the worlds elite bankers supposedly hold.The leader of the Jesuit order is commonly recognized in conspiratorial circles as the Black Pope whose signature staff is a crooked cross. Historically, the Jesuit Order has been seen as one that shirks no crime in expanding the power of the Church.Lest this sound entirely outrageous, one must note that the Jesuits are, for instance, the inventors of concentration camps, which they established in Paraguay in order to incarcerate and then torture the native indians of the area.But the litany of attributed Jesuit evil is even darker than that according to those who believe in the orders continued malicious pursuit. The supposed founder of the Bavarian-based Illuminati, Adam Weishaupt, was a Jesuit.In fact, the order is reputed to have been deeply involved in the Illuminatis initial expansion, and chances are it is still deeply involved.One more thing that highlights the evil of the Jesuits is their extreme oath of induction which all superiors must take in order to be elevated to the higher rungs of the organization. This is taken from the book Subterranean Rome by Carlos Didier, translated from the French, and published in New York in 1843 and reads in part, promise and declare that I will, when opportunity present, make and wage relentless war, secretly or openly, against all heretics, Protestants and Liberals, as I am directed to do, to extirpate and exterminate them from the face of the whole earth; and that I will spare neither age, sex or condition; and that I will hang, waste, boil, flay, strangle and bury alive these infamous heretics, rip up the stomachs and wombs of their women and crush their infants heads against the walls, in order to annihilate forever their execrable race. That when the same cannot be done openly, I will secretly use the poisoned cup, the strangulating cord, the steel of the poniard or the leaden bullet, regardless of the honor, rank, dignity, or authority of the person or persons, whatever may be their condition in life, either public or private, as I at any time may be directed so to do by any agent of the Pope or Superior of the Brotherhood of the Holy Faith, of the Society of Jesus One of the most poignant quotes regarding the malevolence of the Jesuits comes from Marquis de LaFayette 1757-1834; who was a French statesman and general who served in the American Continental Army under the command of General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War.His quote is as follows:It is my opinion that if the liberties of this country  the United States of America  are destroyed, it will be by the subtlety of the Roman Catholic Jesuit priests, for they are the most crafty, dangerous enemies to civil and religious liberty. They have instigated MOST of the wars of Europe.THE BIG BASH When evaluating Jesuit behavior and influence, please keep in mind that both Donald Trump and Hillarys VP, Tim Kaine, are Jesuit educated. And it should be of GREAT interest, therefore, that practically on the eve of the US election, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton partied the night away at a Jesuit function that included such prominent Jesuit-trained attendees as Henry Kissinger.Not only did the two not look like sworn enemies  they looked like two star crossed lovers going to their first prom.We have long held to our stance that Killary will be the next President of the US. The amount of vote rigging, murders and shenanigans to even get her to where she is so far has been tremendous  and it wont stop.That said, if by some fluke, and the Diebold machines malfunction or people in the US wake up slightly and Donald Trump gets elected  it is pretty clear they are on the same team and, as weve said previously, nothing major will change.So, if you were hoping that this election could change things in the US  get over that hope right now. It might change things, but only for the much, much worse.This charade is being played right in front of everyones eyes and most do not understand what is happening or why jokes like the Catholic joke is actually funny to these elite people.They are laughing at the peasants stupidity and lack of understanding, not because the men mentioned are Jews  anyone with half a brain knows that.  The groundwork for global governance has been laid, dont let them blindside you as they attempt to carry out their nefarious plot. Donald Trump even stated at the dinner, Weve got to come together, not only as a nation, but as a world community.https://dollarvigilante.com/blog/2016/10/25/rigged-election-hillary-trump-caught-partying-like-bffs-kissinger-jesuit-gala.html+https://youtu.be/rP45LHZ kIM Above image  the chief staff of EU paying homage to their emperor, the Jesuit pope.These people are called Magis because they can do magic, and the basic tenet why these Magicians are so very successful is that most people want to be fooled.Aside from the fiat monetary scam and bloodsoaked petrodollar, another significant source of funds for the Nazionist Khazarian Mafia is the healthcare industry which registered a whopping $3.09 trillion in 2014 , and is projected to soar to $3.57 trillion in 2017, in the US alone. We believe that this is just a conservative figure.

By Robert ParryThe United States is so committed to the notion that its electoral process is the worlds gold standard that there has been a bipartisan determination to maintain the fiction even when evidence is overwhelming that a U.S. presidential election has been manipulated or stolen. The wise men of the system simply insist otherwise.We have seen this behavior when there are serious questions of vote tampering (as in Election 1960) or when a challenger apparently exploits a foreign crisis to create an advantage over the incumbent (as in Elections 1968 and 1980) or when the citizens judgment is overturned by judges (as in Election 2000).Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan photographed together in the Oval Office in 1991. (Cropped from a White House photo that also included Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.)The harsh truth is that pursuit of power often trumps the principle of an informed electorate choosing the nations leaders, but that truth simply cannot be recognized.Of course, historically, American democracy was far from perfect, excluding millions of people, including African-American slaves and women. The compromises needed to enact the Constitution in 1787 also led to distasteful distortions, such as counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of representation (although obviously slaves couldnt vote).Indeed, the alleged voter fraud in Election 1960, concentrated largely in Texas, a former Confederate state and home to John Kennedys vice presidential running mate, Lyndon Johnson, could be viewed as an outgrowth of the Souths heritage of rigging elections in favor of Democrats, the post-Civil War party of white Southerners.However, by pushing through civil rights for blacks in the 1960s, Kennedy and Johnson earned the enmity of many white Southerners who switched their allegiance to the Republican Party via Richard Nixons Southern strategy of coded racial messaging. Nixon also harbored resentments over what he viewed as his unjust defeat in the election of 1960.Nixons Treason So, by 1968, the Democrats once solid South was splintering, but Nixon, who was again the Republican presidential nominee, didnt want to leave his chances of winning what looked to be another close election to chance. Nixon feared that  with the Vietnam War raging and the Democratic Party deeply divided  President Johnson could give the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a decisive boost by reaching a last-minute peace deal with North Vietnam.President Richard Nixon with his then-National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger in 1972.The documentary and testimonial evidence is now clear that to avert a peace deal, Nixons campaign went behind Johnsons back to persuade South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to torpedo Johnsons Paris peace talks by refusing to attend. Nixons emissaries assured Thieu that a President Nixon would continue the war and guarantee a better outcome for South Vietnam.Though Johnson had strong evidence of what he privately called Nixons treason  from FBI wiretaps in the days before the 1968 election  he and his top advisers chose to stay silent. In a Nov. 4, 1968 conference call , Secretary of State Dean Rusk, National Security Advisor Walt Rostow and Defense Secretary Clark Clifford  three pillars of the Establishment  expressed that consensus, with Clifford explaining the thinking:Some elements of the story are so shocking in their nature that Im wondering whether it would be good for the country to disclose the story and then possibly have a certain individual [Nixon] elected, Clifford said. It could cast his whole administration under such doubt that I think it would be inimical to our countrys interests.Cliffords words expressed the recurring thinking whenever evidence emerged casting the integrity of Americas electoral system in doubt, especially at the presidential level. The American people were not to know what kind of dirty deeds could affect that process.To this day, the major U.S. news media will not directly address the issue of Nixons treachery in 1968, despite the wealth of evidence proving this historical reality now available from declassified records at the Johnson presidential library in Austin, Texas. In a puckish recognition of this ignored history, the librarys archivists call the file on Nixons sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks their X-file. [For details, see Consortiumnews.coms  LBJs X-File on Nixons Treason. ]The evidence also strongly suggests that Nixons paranoia about a missing White House file detailing his treason  top secret documents that Johnson had entrusted to Rostow at the end of LBJs presidency  led to Nixons creation of the plumbers, a team of burglars whose first assignment was to locate those purloined papers. The existence of the plumbers became public in June 1972 when they were caught breaking into the Democratic National Committees headquarters at the Watergate in Washington.National Security Adviser Walt Rostow shows President Lyndon Johnson a model of a battle near Khe Sanh in Vietnam. (U.S. Archive Photo)Although the Watergate scandal remains the archetypal case of election-year dirty tricks, the major U.S. news media never acknowledge the link between Watergate and Nixons far more egregious dirty trick four years earlier, sinking Johnsons Vietnam peace talks while 500,000 American soldiers were in the war zone. In part because of Nixons sabotage  and his promise to Thieu of a more favorable outcome  the war continued for four more bloody years before being settled along the lines that were available to Johnson in 1968. [See Consortiumnews.coms  The Heinous Crime Behind Watergate .]In effect, Watergate gets walled off as some anomaly that is explained by Nixons strange personality. However, even though Nixon resigned in disgrace in 1974, he and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger, who also had a hand in the Paris peace talk caper, reappear as secondary players in the next well-documented case of obstructing a sitting presidents foreign policy to get an edge in the 1980 campaign.Reagans October Surprise Caper In that case, President Jimmy Carter was seeking reelection and trying to negotiate release of 52 American hostages then held in revolutionary Iran. Ronald Reagans campaign feared that Carter might pull off an October Surprise by bringing home the hostages just before the election. So, this historical mystery has been: Did Reagans team take action to block Carters October Surprise?President Ronald Reagan, delivering his Inaugural Address on Jan. 20, 1981, as the 52 U.S. hostages in Iran are simultaneously released.The testimonial and documentary evidence that Reagans team did engage in a secret operation to prevent Carters October Surprise is now almost as overwhelming as the proof of the 1968 affair regarding Nixons Paris peace talk maneuver.That evidence indicates that Reagans campaign director William Casey organized a clandestine effort to prevent the hostages release before Election Day, after apparently consulting with Nixon and Kissinger and aided by former CIA Director George H.W. Bush, who was Reagans vice presidential running mate.By early November 1980, the publics obsession with Irans humiliation of the United States and Carters inability to free the hostages helped turn a narrow race into a Reagan landslide. When the hostages were finally let go immediately after Reagans inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981, his supporters cited the timing to claim that the Iranians had finally relented out of fear of Reagan.Behind the scenes, the Reagan administration signed off on secret arms shipments to Iran, mostly through Israel, what a variety of witnesses described as the payoff for Irans cooperation in getting Reagan elected and then giving him the extra benefit of timing the hostage release to immediately follow his inauguration.Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush with CIA Director William Casey at the White House on Feb. 11, 1981. (Photo credit: Reagan Library)It was clear to me after my conversations with people on high that indeed we had agreed that the Israelis could transship to Iran some American-origin military equipment.   [This operation] seems to have started in earnest in the period probably prior to the election of 1980, as the Israelis had identified who would become the new players in the national security area in the Reagan administration. And I understand some contacts were made at that time.Those early covert arms shipments to Iran evolved into a later secret set of arms deals that surfaced in fall 1986 as the Iran-Contra Affair, with some of the profits getting recycled back to Reagans beloved Nicaraguan Contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaraguas leftist government.Tired of the Story By the early 1990s, the mainstream U.S. news media was also tired of the complex Iran-Contra scandal and wanted to move on. As a correspondent at Newsweek, I had battled senior editors over their disinterest in getting to the bottom of the scandal before I left the magazine in 1990. I then received an assignment from PBS Frontline to look into the 1980 October Surprise question, which led to a documentary on the subject in April 1991.PBS Frontlines: The Election Held Hostage, co-written by Robert Parry and Robert Ross.However, by fall 1991, just as Congress was agreeing to open an investigation, my ex-bosses at Newsweek, along with The New Republic, then an elite neoconservative publication interested in protecting Israels exposure on those early arms deals, went on the attack. They published matching cover stories deeming the 1980 October Surprise case a hoax, but their articles were both based on a misreading of documents recording Caseys attendance at a conference in London in July 1980, which he seemed to have used as a cover for a side trip to Madrid to meet with senior Iranians regarding the hostages.Although the bogus Newsweek/New Republic London alibi would eventually be debunked, it created a hostile climate for the investigation. With Bush angrily denying everything and the congressional Republicans determined to protect the Presidents flanks, the Democrats mostly just went through the motions of an investigation.Meanwhile, Bushs State Department and White House counsels office saw their jobs as discrediting the investigation, deep-sixing incriminating documents, and helping a key witness dodge a congressional subpoena.Years later, I discovered a document at the Bush presidential library in College Station, Texas, confirming that Casey had taken a mysterious trip to Madrid in 1980. The U.S. Embassys confirmation of Caseys trip was passed along by State Department legal adviser Edwin D. Williamson to Associate White House Counsel Chester Paul Beach Jr. in early November 1991, just as the congressional inquiry was taking shape.Williamson said that among the State Department material potentially relevant to the October Surprise allegations [was]a cable from the Madrid embassy indicating that Bill Casey was in town, for purposes unknown, Beach noted in a  memorandum for record  dated Nov. 4, 1991.Two days later, on Nov. 6, Beachs boss, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, convened an inter-agency strategy session and explained the need to contain the congressional investigation into the October Surprise case. The explicit goal was to ensure the scandal would not hurt President Bushs reelection hopes in 1992.C. Boyden Gray, White House counsel under President George H.W. Bush.At the meeting, Gray laid out how to thwart the October Surprise inquiry, which was seen as a dangerous expansion of the Iran-Contra investigation. The prospect that the two sets of allegations would merge into a single narrative represented a grave threat to George H.W. Bushs reelection campaign. As assistant White House counsel Ronald vonLembke, put it , the White House goal in 1991 was to kill/spike this story.Gray explained the stakes at the White House strategy session. Whatever form they ultimately take, the House and Senate October Surprise investigations, like Iran-Contra, will involve interagency concerns and be of special interest to the President, Gray declared, according to minutes . [Emphasis in original.]Among touchstones cited by Gray were No Surprises to the White House, and Maintain Ability to Respond to Leaks in Real Time. This is Partisan. White House talking points on the October Surprise investigation urged restricting the inquiry to 1979-80 and imposing strict time limits for issuing any findings.Timid Democrats But Bushs White House really had little to fear because whatever evidence that the congressional investigation received  and a great deal arrived in December 1992 and January 1993  there was no stomach for actually proving that the 1980 Reagan campaign had conspired with Iranian radicals to extend the captivity of 52 Americans in order to ensure Reagans election victory.Former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana.That would have undermined the faith of the American people in their democratic process  and that, as Clark Clifford said in the 1968 context, would not be good for the country.In 2014 when I sent a copy of Beachs memo regarding Caseys trip to Madrid to former Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Indiana, who had chaired the October Surprise inquiry in 1991-93, he told me that it had shaken his confidence in the task forces dismissive conclusions about the October Surprise issue.The [Bush-41] White House did not notify us that he [Casey] did make the trip to Madrid, Hamilton told me. Should they have passed that on to us? They should have because they knew we were interested in that.Asked if knowledge that Casey had traveled to Madrid might have changed the task forces dismissive October Surprise conclusion, Hamilton said yes, because the question of the Madrid trip was key to the task forces investigation.If the White House knew that Casey was there, they certainly should have shared it with us, Hamilton said, adding that you have to rely on people in authority to comply with information requests. But that trust was at the heart of the inquirys failure. With the money and power of the American presidency at stake, the idea that George H.W. Bush and his team would help an investigation that might implicate him in an act close to treason was nave in the extreme.Arguably, Hamiltons timid investigation was worse than no investigation at all because it gave Bushs team the opportunity to search out incriminating documents and make them disappear. Then, Hamiltons investigative conclusion reinforced the group think dismissing this serious manipulation of democracy as a conspiracy theory when it was anything but. In the years since, Hamilton hasnt done anything to change the public impression that the Reagan campaign was innocent.Still, among the few people who have followed this case, the October Surprise cover-up would slowly crumble with admissions by officials involved in the investigation that its exculpatory conclusions were rushed , that crucial evidence had been hidden or ignored , and that some alibis for key Republicans didnt make any sense .But the dismissive group think remains undisturbed as far as the major U.S. media and mainstream historians are concerned.

The findings had clear implications for the future as well, since the public impression about George H.W. Bushs rectitude was an important factor in the support given to his oldest son, George W. Bush, in 2000.President George W. Bush is introduced by his brother Florida Gov. Jeb Bush before delivering remarks at Sun City Center, Florida, on May 9, 2006. (White House photo by Eric Draper)Indeed, if the full truth had been told about the fathers role in the October Surprise and Iran-Contra cases, its hard to imagine that his son would have received the Republican nomination, let alone made a serious run for the White House. And, if that history were known, there might have been a stronger determination on the part of Democrats to resist another Bush stolen election in 2000.Regarding Election 2000, the evidence is now clear that Vice President Al Gore not only won the national popular vote but received more votes that were legal under Florida law than did George W. Bush. But Bush relied first on the help of officials working for his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, and then on five Republican justices on the U.S. Supreme Court to thwart a full recount and to award him Floridas electoral votes and thus the presidency.The reality of Gores rightful victory should have finally become clear in November 2001 when a group of news organizations finished their own examination of Floridas disputed ballots and released their tabulations showing that Gore would have won if all ballots considered legal under Florida law were counted.However, between the disputed election and the release of those numbers, the 9/11 attacks had occurred, so The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN and other leading outlets did not want the American people to know that the wrong person was in the White House. Surely, telling the American people that fact amid the 9/11 crisis would not be good for the country.So, senior editors at all the top new organizations decided to mislead the public by framing their stories in a deceptive way to obscure the most newsworthy discovery  that the so-called over-votes in which voters both checked and wrote in their choices names broke heavily for Gore and would have put him over the top regardless of which kinds of chads were considered for the under-votes that hadnt registered on antiquated voting machines. Over-votes would be counted under Florida law which bases its standards on clear intent of the voter.However, instead of leading with Gores rightful victory, the news organizations concocted hypotheticals around partial recounts that still would have given Florida narrowly to Bush. They either left out or buried the obvious lede that a historic injustice had occurred.Former Vice President Al Gore. (Photo credit: algore.com)On Nov. 12, 2001, the day that the news organizations ran those stories, I examined the actual data and quickly detected the evidence of Gores victory. In a story that day, I suggested that senior news executives were exercising a misguided sense of patriotism. They had hid the reality for the good of the country, much as Johnsons team had done in 1968 regarding Nixons sabotage of the Paris peace talks and Hamiltons inquiry had done regarding the 1980 October Surprise case.Within a couple of hours of my posting the article at Consortiumnews.com, I received an irate phone call from The New York Times media writer Felicity Barringer, who accused me of impugning the journalistic integrity of then-Times executive editor Howell Raines. I got the impression that Barringer had been on the look-out for some deviant story that didnt accept the Bush-won conventional wisdom.However, this violation of objective and professional journalism  bending the slant of a story to achieve a preferred outcome rather than simply giving the readers the most interesting angle  was not simply about some historical event that had occurred a year earlier. It was about the future.By misleading Americans into thinking that Bush was the rightful winner of Election 2000  even if the medias motivation was to maintain national unity following the 9/11 attacks  the major news outlets gave Bush greater latitude to respond to the crisis, including the diversionary invasion of Iraq under false pretenses. The Bush-won headlines of November 2001 also enhanced the chances of his reelection in 2004. [For the details of how a full Florida recount would have given Gore the White House, see Consortiumnews.coms  Gores Victory ,  So Bush Did Steal the White House , and  Bush v. Gores Dark American Decade. ]A Phalanx of Misguided Consensus Looking back on these examples of candidates manipulating democracy, there appears to be one common element: after the stolen elections, the media and political establishments quickly line up, shoulder to shoulder, to assure the American people that nothing improper has happened. Graceful losers are patted on the back for not complaining that the voters will had been ignored or twisted.U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.Al Gore is praised for graciously accepting the extraordinary ruling by Republican partisans on the Supreme Court, who stopped the counting of ballots in Florida on the grounds, as Justice Antonin Scalia said, that a count that showed Gore winning (when the Courts majority was already planning to award the White House to Bush) would undermine Bushs legitimacy.Similarly, Rep. Hamilton is regarded as a modern wise man, in part, because he conducted investigations that never pushed very hard for the truth but rather reached conclusions that were acceptable to the powers-that-be, that didnt ruffle too many feathers.But the cumulative effect of all these half-truths, cover-ups and lies  uttered for the good of the country  is to corrode the faith of many well-informed Americans about the legitimacy of the entire process. It is the classic parable of the boy who cried wolf too many times, or in this case, assured the townspeople that there never was a wolf and that they should ignore the fact that the livestock had mysteriously disappeared leaving behind only a trail of blood into the forest.So, when Donald Trump shows up in 2016 insisting that the electoral system is rigged against him, many Americans choose to believe his demagogy. But Trump isnt pressing for the full truth about the elections of 1968 or 1980 or 2000. He actually praises Republicans implicated in those cases and vows to appoint Supreme Court justices in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.Trumps complaints about rigged elections are more in line with the white Southerners during Jim Crow, suggesting that black and brown people are cheating at the polls and need to have white poll monitors to make sure they dont succeed at stealing the election from white people.There is a racist undertone to Trumps version of a rigged democracy but he is not entirely wrong about the flaws in the process. Hes just not honest about what those flaws are.The hard truth is that the U.S. political process is not democracys gold standard; it is and has been a severely flawed system that is not made better by a failure to honestly address the unpleasant realities and to impose accountability on politicians who cheat the voters.Investigative reporter Robert Parry broke many of the Iran-Contra stories for The Associated Press and Newsweek in the 1980s.

Dont let the media tell you that the anti-Donald Trump, anti-democratic and anti-American violence occurring across the nation is isolated or limited or really nothing to report on . Because it most certainly is. The mainstream media has just been too busy reporting on some of the stupid or decades-old comments Donald Trump makes to report on them. Or maybe theyre so in the tank for the Left, they are willing to ignore whats right in front of their face  like the undercover video showing Hillary operatives staging and inciting violence at Trump rallies. Some events the media simply cant ignore  like the firebombing of a Republican Party headquarters in North Carolina. That was universally labeled an act of political terrorism, which it clearly was. But the truth is, there are many more examples of this kind of violent hatred across the country. Our friends at Lifezette have compiled some of the most notable examples that you may not have been told about. They get local media coverage, but barely make it into the national news: On Oct. 15 in Bangor, Maine, vandals spray-painted about 20 parked cars outside a Trump rally. Trump supporter Paul Foster, whose van was hit with white paint, told reporters, Why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars, all of this, to make their statement? Around Oct. 3, a couple of Trump supporters were assaulted in Zeitgeist, a San Francisco bar, after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for Trump, GotNews reports. The two Trump supporters were attacked, punched, and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back. Lilian Kim of ABC 7 Bay Area tweeted a photo of the men, in which one was wearing a Trump T-shirt and the other was wearing a Blue Lives Matter shirt. On Sept. 28 in El Cajon, California, an angry mob at a Black Lives Matter protest beat 21-year-old Trump supporter Feras Jabro for wearing a Make America Great Again baseball cap. The assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app Periscope. On Sept. 26 at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota, as the first presidential debate was about to get underway, a woman wearing Trump campaign apparel was assaulted while heading to a debate watch event. Nobody, regardless of race, gender, or political party, should feel unsafe because of the way they look or what they wear when they walk on campus, the Minnesota Federation of College Republicans said in a press release. On Aug. 19 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trump supporters had to run a gauntlet of angry protesters to get into a Trump fundraiser at the Minneapolis Convention Center. When they left after the event they were hit, pushed, and spit on. On Aug. 13 in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, 68-year-old cancer survivor Vester Bullock was beaten at a garage sale because he wore a Trump pin on his hat. The assailant slammed his arms, walked up to me and said, My wife told me I shouldnt trust a God-damn Republican,' he said. The man complained the staple gun Bullock sold him didnt work. I told him Ill give you your money back,' said Bullock. But he kept calling me all kinds of names. The man punched Bullock in the jaw so hard he lost a tooth. On Aug. 12 in the West Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, two women assaulted pro-Trump activist Tim Treadstone after a Trump rally. This blonde girl grabbed my iPhone and threw it as hard as she could to the pavement, he said. And before I could pick it up, the brunette who was throwing the food at people punched me in the head. My glasses and my hat flew off. There were claw marks on my neck. Last week, the two women were formally charged with assault and battery. The night of the rally, Treadstone and a group of Trump hat-wearers were denied service at a popular Mexican eatery. Customers began screaming at the Trump backers and throwing food at them. Earlier, at the West Hollywood rally, a can of Monster energy drink, eggs, and dog feces were also thrown at pro-Trump demonstrators, according to Breitbart News. The can of Monster hit one man on the back. On Aug. 3 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, an assailant attacked a 62-year-old man who was walking down the street wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt, local police said. The motorist inquired why [the man] was wearing the shirt, directing profanities at him, a police spokesman said. The [victim] continued to walk away as [the] motorist followed him. The motorist hit the man several times with a crowbar, causing injuries to his arms, hands, and thighs, On June 18, 19-year-old British national Michael Sandford tried to take a gun from a Las Vegas police officer during a Trump rally. Sandford was arrested and reportedly said he intended to use the gun to kill Trump. Unlike most of the anti-Trump attacks, this event was widely reported by the media. On June 2, in San Jose, California, rioters assaulted a group of attendees leaving a Trump rally. Fourteen of those attacked have filed a class-action lawsuit against the city and Mayor Sam Liccardo. The attendees were victimized by being forced by armed police to walk into a riot in full swing where many were assaulted while police looked on, said their lawyer, Harmeet K. Dhillon. In San Jose, protesters also threw eggs, a tomato, and a bottle at Rachel Casey, a 29-year-old Trump supporter they cornered outside a hotel. I knew if I was to touch one of them or I was to grab one of the flags they were waving in my face that they would have attacked me or beaten me with those flag poles that were metal, Casey told Breitbart News. I just kept a straight face, I dont know how. I just knew if I touched one of them I would get hurt. Luckily someone let me in that hotel, finally, someone finally opened the door. On April 28, in Costa Mesa, California, anti-Trump demonstrators threw rocks at moving cars. One bloodied the face of a Trump supporter who was driving away after the rally. About 20 people were arrested. On March 12 at the Dayton, Ohio, airport, Black Lives Matter supporter Thomas Dimassimo rushed the small stage where Trump was speaking, an attack that received widespread media attention. He was tackled by Secret Service agents before he could reach the GOP candidate and was later charged with disorderly conduct and inducing panic. Before the attack he tweeted: Ive had about all I can take from the violent trump ralliers. Saturday im [sic] going to check my people and spit on their false king. After his release from jail, hours later, he tweeted: F**k you b**ch @realDonaldTrump[.] This is but a sampling of the violence that has occurred by the left against Republicans, conservatives and Donald Trump supporters. So anyone who suggests that there would be violence after any contested elections needs to turn their eyes squarely on Hillary Clinton and her supporters.
Pinterest Its been a quarter-century since Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas made history by becoming only the second black judge ever to serve on the nations highest court. But you wont see celebrations, recognition, or even acknowledgement of this feat  in fact, the Thomas-derangement, as The Daily Caller calls it, has not abated one bit. This despite the fact that the impact Thomas has had is unequaled. Thomas is one of the nations most influential lawmakers and has admirers from all legal corners. Yet, he is ridiculed, belittled, and assaulted with the type of disgusting comments usually reserved for common criminals and deviants. Writing in The New York Times , Maureen Dowd referred to the Justice as the creepy guy who acted pervy toward [Anita Hill] and won. This barrage of insults is not just among his legal and intellectual peers, either. Thomas has been completely wiped clean from any mention in the new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. His accuser Anita Hill, however, is given prominent display. The exhibit features testimonies trumpeting her courage and the surge of womens activism that ensued, while making only peripheral reference to Thomas. Despite these slights, Thomas continues to speak out. At a speech at the Heritage Foundation, the justice warned that we are destroying our institutions. At some point, we are going to have to recognize that we are destroying our institutions, he said, acknowledging that the Court might also partially be at fault. What have we done to gain their confidence? he asked. Perhaps we should ask ourselves what we have done to not earn it or to earn it. The courts lone African-American justice also defended his view that even prior Supreme Court precedents must be bent or broken to comply with the Constitution  something most of his colleagues dont believe. Youve got lots of precedents out there that have been changed, Thomas said. I believe we are obligated to rethink things constantly. Thomas ended with some positive words about former Justice Antonin Scalia, who he affectionately referred to as Nino. The court has become evenly divided between liberals and conservatives, a change that could become even more pronounced if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency and controls who will replace Scalia. But Thomas chose to dwell more on his friendship with Nino than ponder the future without him. He was from the north, and I was from the south, but we wound up at the same place, he said, referring to their views on the paramount importance of the Constitution and individual freedoms. Scalia, he said, fretted over big principles as well as smaller things such as punctuation and syntax.
Black Emanuelle fixed all that in 1976. Attila Speaking of Europeans Colonialism/exploitation and the Ottomans. Your Europe is only Western Europe. Eastern European countries were not colonizers. They never adventured outside of the continent either and never been in the slavery business. They were colonized, brutalized and saved by Asians inducing the Mongol Empire and the Muslim Ottoman Empire. So please refer to Western Europe only when you speak of Europe. Eastern Europeans were often the victims of none-whites and Islamic imperialism. Ever wondered why Hungary is not accepting any Muslim migrants? Attren Atilla, will you please be so kind as to reference some quality literature on this subject? I am most interested and want to learn more (eastern european). Thank you, brother. Attila Google the Mongol invasion of Hungary and Eastern Europe also the Ottoman period in Eastern Europe. Bob Btme Im familiar with the story of the guy playing the trumpet in Poland who got the arrow in the neck. The history of the ancient cannabis- using Scythian marauders is also interesting, Bob Btme thanks Attila for educating us on that, I love history and barely received any during my 17 years spent in the USA public school system Rod The reason your not taught accurate history in school is that the book writers are formerly propaganda and car salesmen teachers. All one has to do is research the history of said companies like McGraw Hill and such. Sloane Attila is half telling the truth and half over-simplifying/lying Sloane Attila is clearly deranged. You shouldnt believe much of what he writes. Daniel Sandman hmm.. wouldnt the Visigoths count as eastern Europeans? They brought down the west roman empire and colonized it. And what about those Vandals? Attila There were many ethnic groups living in the Carpathian base or what is now Eastern Europe before Christian Europe was born. There were the Avars, Cumans, Gepids and many others who were pagans and did not have a state. They came and left. When Hungary and other Eastern European accepted Christianity and formed their own country thats the time they joined Europe and stayed and had their kingdoms. Thats when countries become accountable. Im concerned about Christian Europe because thats what Europe is today. Thats what we protected and sacrificed so much for. Alejandra What do you think about your christian europe and the genocide at america? Attila You mean Western European colonial powers? As an Eastern European whos people suffered genocide from Asians ans Muslims and were left alone to defend Europe and betrayed by Western Europe I say some of those countries owe us a apology. France formed the Franco-Ottoman alliance basically legalizing our enslavement by the Muslim Ottomans. They betrayed Christian Europe and us Hungarians and the Serbians, Bulgarians, Romanians and Poles. France and some of the Western European colonial countries were not true Christians. If they were they would not let us to be enslaved by the Islamic Ottoman Empire. Funny how France was the first congratulating Suleiman the Magnificent after he defeated the Hungarians at Mohacs in 1526. Yes slavery was legal in the Ottoman Empire and France had no problem teaming up with our slave master and have our country turn in to a wasteland. Eastern Europeans dont think highly of Western Europeans. Eastern Europeans whites are proud people. niels groenbaek This old Europe was bad. France, Belgium did leave every country/territory in a mess Attila Just imagine. Europe was under threat of being conquered by the Ottomans. The sultans openly expressed their desire to conquer Europe and convert i it to Islam. They dreamed of converting the Vatican in to a mosque. Then you have France who formed and alliance with them. They truly betrayed not only the Eastern European countries who came under Islamic terror but Europe and Christianity as well.  Theyve stopped dreaming about it and have been doing it by stealth for the last 50 or so years. John L. Wildman You need to shut the fuck up till you know what youre talking about. Simona Mamo The Raiders of the Ottoman empire also regularly raided Malta. We are a small island in the middle of the Mediterranean sea and stole the locals for slaves. Besides butchering and pillaging. Rod Much like columbus did to us native american indians I suppose. Simona Mamo Lol. Well previous to the Spanish invasion for lack of a better word, they themselves had just liberated the Iberian peninsula(Spain) from the Moorish empire. Sad how people who have themselves had to fight for so long to free themselves from a conqurer yoke so easily become conquers themselves. In fact I believe I read somewhere that Isabella sent Colombus off in the hope of new trade routes to India as she needed money for her continuing war against the Ottoman empire.Trouble in one region always seems to spread. Diesel67 War against the Ottoman Empire took a back seat to getting rid of Jews. Much of the Spanish Jews expelled in 1492 migrated to the Ottoman lands, so much so that the Ottoman sultan said in substance: Ferdinand calls himself a clever king but he enriches my kingdom even as he impoverishes his own. Of course all that changed when the Spanish conquered most of the Americas, plundered its resources and enslaved or killed the indigenous population (no worse than any other conquering empire throughout history). Simona Mamo Lol. Colombus actually took a Jew with him on his voyage of exploration. Sloane Well wouldnt geography play a big part in colonization? From what port could Hungary go and control a colony in Africa? Do you count Russians as Eastern Europeans? If so, then you cant say Eastern European countries were not colonizers. Attila Most of Russia is in Asia just like Turkey. Russia didnt slave or colonized African countries and was not in the slave trade at all. They didnt commit genocide against non Russians either as a colonizer. They didnt go further then some of their neighboring countries. The Soviet Union was bad but a different animal all together. Russia is not on the radar of progressive liberals and black activist who are the most vocal about the crimes of Colonialism. If you insist maybe I could say countries that are in Eastern Europe only or entirely Eastern European or central-East European countries. Sloane Russia didnt slave or colonize African countries but part of that is that they couldnt because of the Western Europeans already there (Russians DID attempt to try to expand into/colonize parts of Africa  https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1rpfwp/russian colonialism in africa/ ). My point is that youre oversimplifying history and victimizing Eastern Europeans in a thread about the Congo? Why? Have some respect and take your tirade elsewhere. Your post started with Speaking of Europeans Colonialism/exploitation and the Ottomans. This article wasnt speaking about colonialism or the ottomans in general. You brought it in. Hungary had ports on the Adriatic see for hundreds of years. And you just proved how expansionist the Hungarians were! And people are supposed to have sympathy for poor E. Europeans because they didnt get the chance to commit atrocities like their Western European counterparts? Give me a break! Attila You are one of those useful idiots arent you? Here is my solution for the idiots that includes many of the commentators also: Two words should not be used and those are WHITES and EUROPEANS. Instead use words like Western Europeans, Western European Colonial powers, Colonial Americans, Colonial Spain, England or what ever countries were the culprits. In the USA they should use words like European Americans, Western European Immigrants or Colonial Americans. Understand that your history is not our history and your crimes are not our crimes. Generalizing white Caucasians puts Eastern Europeans into the same category as a white slave keeper in colonial America hundreds of years ago or a Belgian murderer in Africa. It seems you have a sick need to drag down all white people and equal them to those who violated non-Whites. We are from the other half of Europe, from other countries with a totally different historical background and we have absolutely nothing to do with colonization and slavery. Do you understand the difference between Eastern Europe and Western Europe? To put it simple: West was the colonizer vs. East which was colonized. Im asking you to be considerate of us and stop the anti-white bigotry. If progressives keep using terms such as legacy of European exploitation, white racism and many other insults I encourage that you talk to Eastern Europeans such as Poles, Czechs, Croats, Slovaks and Hungarians and ask them what they think about the practice of generalizing whites and Europeans. They will tell you that you are embarrassing and you dont talk on their behalf. Dont be surprised if they express their disgust if you try to patronize them like you are trying me. Believe me the the West have no idea just how low opinion Eastern Europeans have for the West because the anti-white narrative and views the West holds. The more Eastern European EU countries become mainstream the more we are going to oppose you and will not going to put up with racism that we dont deserve. You can bet on it. You attempt to get sympathy for the victims of Congo while you trash Europe will not get any respect from us. As per your comment about having a port on the Adriatic sea at the expense of other nations just shows how little you know. Hungarians never treated Croatia as colony and certainly didnt oppress or violated Croatians. It was a union that benefited both countries especially protecting the borders against the Islamic Imperialist. Why dont you ask Croatians about what they think about it, you useful idiot. Sloane Uhh I am half-Croatian,half-Bosnian, born in Dubrovnik, you fascist waste of air. I never generalized white Caucasians or trshed Eastern Europeans. Look at my comments again and youll see who was the idiot. Ill save you the trouble  its you   I entered into a conversation with you to see just how bad your historical knowledge is  and that is VERY bad. Your original comments hinted at your xenophobia and racism and your further comments proved it. I wish you the best, I wish you would read decent history books from ALL OVER eastern Europe, not just Hungary. You may learn something, you may learn to be less fearful of change. Fear is the worst thing and your comments are brimming with fear  fear of migrants, muslims, etc. Bye Attila Bosnian? That explains it: you are a Muslim or a Muslim sympathizer. That explains why are in denial and trying to push your agenda. You are just another progressive liberal who protects islamo fascist agenda because thats your heritage. Islam is the ideology of our former slave master and pure evil ideology. You know we were called infidel dogs by your kind for 150 years. Even now all you can do is just freak out and bark like we were still dogs. Why not put yourself together and give an honest argument and a fact based debate. But I dont think you can. Sloane You lack basic reading comprehension. I am half Croatian, half-Bosnian. I am Catholic, not Muslim LOL. You have mental issues. Attila Muslim sympathizer on your Bosnian Muslim side is enough for me. That explains why you are in the same hate camp with the libshits. Good combo! Since you are talking about mental issues please take your medication and do yourself a favor and dont skip again! Sloane What Bosnian Muslim side and hate camp? Do you even understand English? Do you know ANYTHING? Read my comments again. I am 100% Catholic. I told you to read up on history books, you are trying to defend Eastern European history when you dont even know it. Croatia is 90% Catholic, Bosnia is Muslim, Orthodox and Catholic. I am half Bosnian Croat half Croat Catholic, so 100% Catholic. You retard. We in Dubrovnik remained independent and will continue to remain independent so we dont have to fear the muslims like you do. The ones that are the most foreign, like you Asiatic Hungarians, are the ones most afraid of immigrants and are full of complexes as your messages have show. Goodbye now bozgor. Attila Still trying the fool me. Christian Croats live in Herzegovina and not the Bosnian side. Nice but a stupid try. It may have worked with someone else. I like your way of using the word Bozgor because it fits you. Really expresses your true intention and bigotry. I guess I should thank you for that. You know its not a bad thing to fear Muslims when they slaved and killed us and turned the country in to a wasteland just because we were Christians. I guess it does something to the psyche. Say hello to you Muslims neighbors and friends in Bosnia aIm sure you enjoy your time with them. John L. Wildman I agree. The more Atilla talks, the more stupid he sounds. Scooter McHeadshot Trying to include the US as a primary culprit shows your lack of knowledge and history. The US was at best a 3d string team when it came to colonies and military adventurism overseas. The ENTIRE problem of the middle east and africa can be lain squarely at the feet of the europeans, most notably the English and French, with honorable mention to the Germans, Dutch and Portuguese (and in the 20th century the Soviets) If you really think the Ottomans were 1.) holding arabia together and 2.) kept it peaceful, you have some reading to do. The Ottomans were barely hanging on the last 300 years of their reign, and fought against countless rebellions and foreign invasions due to the nature of their empire. Try reading A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Turkish Empire and the Making of the Modern Middle East by David Fromkin. Also read The Arabs by Eugene Rogan, it has a decent overview of the problems and shortcomings of the Ottomans. Diesel67 The Ottomans lost their empire because they backed the wrong horse in World War I and because of local disgust with their corrupt misrule. Their fault. BTW, the Arabs and other Muslims they ruled over were not Turks and did not speak Turkish. Arutima 10 millions? Thats cute. The British have beaten that just with the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Where they used musket balls covered with pork tallow and fat, and buried Mughal Muslim troops alive with pork carcasses. Steve Haden Well, it worked .. sabelmouse the british had more colonies as well. all the colonials need to answer for their deeds. Rufus McBoofus I didnt realize it was competition .

The Congolese that survived probably mostly stayed in Congo. They were also black, so few white people at the time cared (they should, but in the 1800s didnt) and few other people knew (they should but in the 1800s didnt). The Holocaust in Europe happened to a very educated people (not judging, just stating a fact) of the which most survivers migrated to Israel and North America which means they talked and talked about it but not just among themselves but on radio in the USA, on movies like Schindlers List and set museums not in Congo but in New York and established a state called Israel that made it a policy to spread awareness of the Holocaust. The Jews are also a people that are central to world affairs and always have been  again, just stating a fact without judgement (thats true in science, politics, and many other areas). Therefore its not just an arbitrary or a racist fact, but the differences in both tragedies, that made the Congolese genocide (and many others) be forgotten and the one perpetrated to the Jews remembered. Compare that to Darfour, in the 2000s and yes, a lot more people know and have heard of such a genocide. So it is not just race, it is also time and place that determined memorability. Arron Frazier Your comment about whites calling themselves Jews being educated is attempted back hand slap at African people being unintelligent which is typical propaganda of white supremacist. First of the so-called Holocaust was plain and simple white on white crime and violence. The whites of Europe WW2 and back to the start of the Catholic Church committed alot crime violence and killing against each. It was constant warring disputes and etc. They where always trying to rule over each other or trying to rule of thew world know at that time. African people had nothing to do with that at all. Second the Congo and Africa have been the economic engine of western civilization since the 1400s with slavery colonialism imperalism and now Neo-colonialism. Third your notion whites calling themselves Jews are and have always been central to world affairs is a lie. They are central today because of white supremacy leaving Europe in the 1400s with slavery colonialism and imperailism. Whites calling themselves Jews where right in the middle of everything and in many cases controlling and leading things. Prior to that whites calling themselves Jews have been central to the affairs of empires civilization and peoples of the Americas Africa and Asia. They had nothing to do with the Aztec Incas Olmecs Mayans and varies tribes and nations of North America. They had nothing to do with Africa with ancient Egypt Nubia Ethopia Great Zimbabwe Congo empires Ashanti Zulus Nok and etc. They had nothing to do with Asia with the Chinese dynasties civilization empire nor the Japanese India Anka Wat and etc. What happen in Europe was nothing more than white or white crime which was common practice among whites WW2 going back over a 1000 years. Naten Vos But this genocide was not forgotten at the time itself. English journalists documented this genocide at the time which forced Leopold II to sell his colony to Belgium. So its not true that there was no press and no information. Of course it is true that information was much more limited than now or than information of Europe during WOII. It is forgotten or less known now maybe because our interest is fading. And that is a sad thing. Btw: David Van Reybrouck wrote a history on Congo. Interesting read, also available in english. sabelmouse the holocaust had films, photos, super documentation. would that we had the same regarding colonial misdeeds, slave ships, and plantations. maybe people would pay more attention. i do often link pics from india during the late victorian holocausts, people being starved, and worked to death by the british empire. junktex And then theres the Holodomor.Bolsheviks illed over 10 million Ukrainians.One might research the ethnicity of most of the Bolsheviks.

This is despite the fact that of the hundreds of nations that have existed in this world, many have done truly horrible things, but our educational system can barely cover our own country, with little mention beyond about a half-dozen others. Just how broad and deep do you think our educational system ought to cover world and human events? Speaking of which, what was the Ottoman Empire doing at the same time as this king?

Project Veritas Releases Fourth Video Exposing Illegal Contributions and High Level Political Corruption Home / #Solutions / A Humanitarian Crisis is Unfolding at #NoDaplProtest and The Media is Silent  Heres How You Can Help A Humanitarian Crisis is Unfolding at #NoDaplProtest and The Media is Silent  Heres How You Can Help Claire Bernish October 28, 2016 1 Comment North Dakota  A humanitarian crisis is unfolding inside the United States as thousands of Native Americans, indigenous people from around the world, and advocates from every walk of life camp in North Dakota in support of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe water protectors opposing construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Slated to run under the Missouri River, the pipeline poses a direct threat to the drinking water supply of the Standing Rock Reservation and at least 18 million people downstream, particularly given Energy Transfer Partners (ETP)  the company in charge of construction  has a horrendous safety record marked by thousands of leaks and spills in the last six years, alone. Despite remaining peaceful on the whole, the protectors of the water have been met with needless escalation and indiscriminate violence by taxpayer-funded, heavily militarized law enforcement protectors of Big Oil and Wall Street  whose vested interests in exporting North Dakotas sweet, light crude apparently trump human rights and basic decency. On Thursday, tensions exploded when law enforcement  armed with lethal and nonlethal weaponry and backed by tanks and MRAPS  implemented a no-fly zone and descended on water protectors attempting to block access by construction crews, including some in the midst of prayer. Employing LRAD sound cannon technology, nonlethal beanbag projectiles, Tasers, pepper spray, and mace against the unarmed crowd, law enforcement forcefully cleared the blockade  affecting more than 140 arrests and injuring dozens in the process. The protesters are not being peaceful or prayerful, Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said in a press statement cited by ABC News . Law enforcement has been very methodical in moving ahead slowly as to not escalate the situation. However, the protesters are using very dangerous means to slow us down. Their aggressive tactics include using horses, fire and trying to flank us with horses and people. Witnesses on the scene, backed by patchy live stream and recorded video , paint a sharply contrasting picture of the incident.

We continue to pray for peace. We call on the state of North Dakota to oversee the actions of local law enforcement to, first and foremost, ensure everyones safety. The Department of Justice must send overseers immediately to ensure the protection of First Amendment rights and the safety of thousands here at Standing Rock. DOJ can no longer ignore our requests. If harm comes to any who come here to stand in solidarity with us, it is on their watch. They must step in and hold the state of North Dakota and Morton County accountable for their acts of violence against innocent, prayerful people. VIdeo of police shooting into crowd of water protectors cc: @UNPeacekeeping #NoDAPL https://t.co/7ggsEZ6bUY pic.twitter.com/O5mRsptxZq  Occupy Wall Street (@OccupyWallStNYC) October 27, 2016 Indeed, for weeks, many witnesses have recounted the same violent tactics against those engaged in prayer, as Danny Grassrope told ABC News on Saturday, This weekend we went to go demonstrate with peaceful action. We went to go pray. Then while we were praying, the cops came and told us we couldnt be there. We were just standing there and then this police officer came and opened up with some pepper spray. We werent antagonizing them or anything, we were just praying. So absurdly overzealous was the police response to the unarmed crowd on Thursday, even proponents of the pipeline took to social media to voice deep concerns about the needless escalation. Such incidents are only likely to continue, as water protectors have vowed to peacefully resist until ETP completely abandons plans to construct the Dakota Access Pipeline  which, incidentally, wont even benefit Americans in any way as the crude it transports will be shipped overseas to line the pockets of investors in the project. That resistance and protection of the water supply of millions could come at a steep price in the very near future  an unusually bitter winter looms on the horizon. North Dakota winters are notorious for biting winds, heavy snowfall, and generally brutal conditions  but the forecast for this winter predicts lower than average temperatures. By the end of November, daytime highs will hover around the low 30s Fahrenheit, and will continue to slip downward through the month of December into the 20s and even teens. January highs for the Bismarck area average just 24 degrees in a given year  but January 2017, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, will be much colder, with many days not even close to breaking 20 degrees, and lows in the negative digits. And that bleak picture doesnt account for wind chill  roughly, the temperature and wind speed combination which affects the rate of the bodys heat loss when exposed to the elements  and North Dakotas winter winds are higher than the national average. Because the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and their supporters view protection of water  which they consider a living entity  as an unequivocal duty, encampments in various locations include particularly vulnerable populations, including elders, women, and children. In no uncertain terms, this is a dangerous set of circumstances. These encampments have been preparing to deal with frigid conditions, but are in desperate need of support from those empathetic to their cause. After all, this is not a protest by any stretch of the imagination, despite mainstream medias narrative. This movement, this resistance  unprecedented in size and scope in over a century  concerns every person reliant on not only the Missouri River, but every water source in the country. So, if you have wanted to support the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in protecting the water but are unable to travel to the camps in person, there are still a number of ways you can help  and it is sorely needed. Remember, Native American reservation populations are among the most impoverished in the nation, thanks to centuries of exploitation and unkept government promises  simply going to a big box store and purchasing necessary supplies isnt an option. But many of us can spare a little to help support those on the front lines who are protecting all of us from poisoned water. Perhaps the easiest way to donate is through the Standing Rock Sioux Tribes PayPal fund, which will be allotted for legal, sanitary, and emergency purposes, and can be found here , or through the Tribes GoFundMe page, here . If you would prefer to write a check, make it payable to Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and send it to: Standing Rock Sioux Tribe
Email Poll results released on Wednesday by Gallup confirm the trend toward the acceptance of the freedom to own guns and support of the Second Amendment. Sixteen years ago 59 percent of those polled favored a law which would make it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess semi-automatic guns known as assault rifles, while just 39 percent were opposed. Today those numbers have flipped: Just 36 percent support a ban, while 61 percent of those polled oppose it. Even those polled who dont have a gun in their home oppose such a ban. Most surprisingly, however, is that support for such a ban has dropped even among those most likely to support one: Democrats. In the year 2000, 63 percent of Democrats supported such a ban, while today just 50 percent do. Wrote Art Swift for Gallup: It is striking  and unusual  that fewer Democrats than ever support an assault weapons ban, since the Democratic Party has been instrumental in pushing for stricter gun laws. Perhaps comforting to those watching how Independents might vote in the upcoming presidential election, Gallup reported that just 31 percent of them support such a ban (the same as Democrats), while in 2000, 63 percent did. Swift called the results a paradox: Perhaps paradoxically, opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles. These guns were used in high-profile incidents, including the terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, California, and Orlando, and the mass shootings in Aurora, Colorado, and Newtown, Connecticut. Gallup could help its cause by defining more carefully the distinct difference between assault rifles and assault weapons. Assault rifles have been heavily regulated for decades, being defined as rifles used by the military that are select fire: able to fire multiple rounds with a single press of the finger on the trigger. Assault weapons were never defined until the Brady Bill was passed into law in 1994. Then they were defined as rifles that were semi-automatic, firing but a single round with a single press of the trigger. The bill also declared such a weapon as banned if it had any two of five cosmetic features that had nothing to do with its lethality: a collapsible stock, a pistol grip, a bayonet mount, a flash suppressor, or a grenade launcher (which is useless without grenades). Commentators jumped on the Gallup report with all manner of explanations as to the cause of the continuing drop in support for a ban or, conversely, citizens increasing support for gun ownership. Sean Davis, the co-founder of The Federalist , declared, Americans understand that terrorists want to murder us, and that our laws are no obstacle to their blood lust. They will use planes, or bombs, or trucks, or knives, or box cutters, or guns.  Strict gun control laws in cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C. have done nothing to prevent sky-high murder rates in those cities year after year. Its possible that the message offered for years by Pastor Chuck Baldwin, a presidential candidate for the Constitution Party in 2008, is gaining purchase as well. In a recent newsletter Baldwin pulled no punches: To take away the citizens right to bear a semi-automatic rifle is to, in effect, completely disarm him . The only reason that would-be tyrants in the US government have been kept at bay is because of an American citizenry fully armed with semi-automatic rifles. That they are fully armed may be an understatement. The usual estimate of the number of firearms owned by American citizens has routinely been reported at 300 million, plus or minus. But that doesnt square with the fact of increasing numbers of citizens purchasing firearms, setting records month-after-month for the last year and a half. WeaponsMan blog, written by a former Special Forces soldier and a stickler for details, investigated the publicly available data from government sources, including the ATF itself, and found the number to be vastly larger: upwards of 660 million. His analysis is available here . He concludes that the US inventory of firearms is almost certainly between 412 and 660 million, not the lower numbers recently trumpeted by the media. The irony remains that, thanks to the medias propaganda blitz against the private ownership of firearms, awareness of what the true agenda is continues to grow. The harder gun-grabbers push, the harder it will be for them to accomplish their ultimate goal: complete confiscation of every firearm from every private citizen in the country. More than 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson saw the threat, and gave perhaps the most reasonable explanation for todays increasing support of the right of the people to buy, bear, keep and use firearms: The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.

Email The alleged connection between Donald Trump and Russia  asserted by Hillary Clinton in both the second and third presidential debates as a dodge for the leaked e-mails and other documents which have hounded her candidacy  has dominated much of the speculative attention of both the mainstream media and social media for weeks. Is there anything to it? Is Trump, in essence, Putins puppet, as Clinton claimed in the third debate? In an interesting twist of logic (if one can use that word to describe the incoherent and dissonant arguments made by a woman who still denies  despite mountains of evidence to the contrary  that she sent and received classified data over her unsecured, private e-mail server), Hillary Clinton at once claims that Russia is responsible for the hack of the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in late spring and that there is no way her server was hacked by anyone. Leveraging the anti-Russian sentiment to its fullest, she and others in the DNC have sought to shift the focus away from what was on the servers and toward blaming Russia for the hack. After all, if Russia is trying to throw the election to Trump, wouldnt the patriotic vote be for Clinton? By the time WikiLeaks announced that a trove of damning documents and e-mails would be published on the Internet, Clinton and the DNC (along with their lapdog media) were already in full-blown "it was Russia" mode. On the same day that a video of Donald Trump emerged in which he can be heard bragging of his sexual abuse of women  which he has since claimed was just locker room talk  WikiLeaks began a rolling release of the promised leaked documents. Both of these stories deserved media attention . Only one got it. By the time the media was ready to report anything on the WikiLeaks dump, it was to speculate as to what part Russia played in the initial hack. Clinton  in her role as the staunch anti-Russian  used the timing of the second debate to attack Trump for the video and his supposed ties to Russia, which she plainly blamed for the leaked documents, saying to moderator Martha Raddatz: But, you know, lets talk about whats really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we dont even know if its accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, theyre not doing it to get me elected. Theyre doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. Clinton went even further in the third debate , bringing up Putin in an attempt to dodge a question about a leaked document showing that she gave a speech to a foreign bank in which she said, My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders. She  again  put the emphasis on the fact that WikiLeaks was providing the leaked documents rather than on what the leaked documents have to say. Then she claimed, on the authority of 17 of our intelligence agencies, that Russia was behind the hacked and leaked documents: But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks. And whats really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans. They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions. Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet. This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election. Trump rebutted by bringing the conversation back on topic (not his usual strongest point), saying: She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country. People are going to come in from Syria. She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people. They have no idea where they come from. And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country. She wont even mention the words, and neither will President Obama. So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders. Now we can talk about Putin. I dont know Putin. He said nice things about me. If we got along well, that would be good. If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. He has no respect for her. He has no respect for our president. And Ill tell you what: Were in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads  1,800, by the way  where they expanded and we didnt, 1,800 nuclear warheads. And shes playing chicken. Look, Putin... At this point, Clinton interrupted to say, Well, thats because hed rather have a puppet as president of the United States. So, getting past the he-said-she-said, what are the facts as we know them? On Monday, the New York Times reported that after conducting a months-long investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign in which agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J. Trump, looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures, searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats, and even chased a lead  which they ultimately came to doubt  about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank, the FBI sees no clear link between Trump and Russia. Of course, in typical leftist fashion, the Times not-so-gently insinuates that the FBI is guilty of pulling punches in the investigation. Interestingly, the Times seemed to miss that that is exactly what happened in the FBI's investigation into Clinton's e-mail server. As for Clintons claims that the purpose of the hacked and leaked documents and e-mails was to influence the election for Trump, the Times article admits: Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any conclusive or direct link between Mr. Trump and the Russian government. And even the hacking into Democratic emails, F.B.I. and intelligence officials now believe, was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr. Trump. Also on Monday, Slate published an article claiming that a server belonging to Donald Trump was communicating in a secretive fashion with servers in Russia. By the next day, the Washington Post had debunked the Slate article, saying, That secret Trump-Russia email server link is likely neither secret nor a Trump-Russia link. Based in part on an interview with Naadir Jeewa, who does consulting work on precisely the sorts of systems involved in the scenario involving the server Slate claims was acting as a conduit between Trump and Russia, the article by the Post explains: To understand what's likely happening, we need to establish a few basics. First of all, the Trump server wasn't really a Trump server. It was much less of a Trump email server, for example, than Hillary Clinton's email server was hers. Clinton had a physical server that hosted her email. The trump-email.com domain that Alfa was connecting to was hosted by a company called Cendyn. Cendyn runs marketing systems for the hospitality industry, meaning that it offers an out-of-the-box solution for a company that owns a bunch of hotels to push out sales pitch emails to its customers. In other words, trump-email.com isn't the email server Trump used to send emails from his closet. It was a domain name that linked back to a Cendyn server. This is important for a few reasons. The first, Jeewa said, was that the trump-email.com was configured to reject a certain type of query from another server. Since its job was simply to push out thousands of enticements to come stay at Trump Soho (or whatever) it didn't need to receive many incoming requests (like incoming email). The second is that the conspiracy theory hinges on Trump's team using an offsite server hosted by someone else for its quiet communications with its Russian allies. Instead of, say, their own server, under their own control. Or an encrypted chat app. Or a phone call. This writer has to admit to being amused to see the shoe on the other foot (or the tinfoil hat on the other head, in this instance) as the Left trots out wild conspiracy theories to create a Trump-Putin connection to make Clinton retroactively correct. In point of fact, Clinton might be better off trying to implicate Trump in the Kennedy assassination. But, what about Clintons assertion that WikiLeaks is releasing documents pilfered by Russia for the sake of influencing the election for Trump? Aside from the FBI saying that there does not appear to be any attempt to influence the election for Trump, Julian Assange, the founder and public face of WikiLeaks, denies that Russian hackers are his source. In an upcoming documentary made by Dartmouth Films, Assange speaks of the Clinton camp putting forth a hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything. He goes on to say, Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. Thats false  we can say that the Russian government is not the source. Furthermore, the Kremlin denies Clintons claims. Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov called the claims nonsense. While that  in and of itself  would not carry much weight, when it is added to the body of evidence that includes Assange denying the Russian connection, the laughably far-fetched lengths to which the Left will got to promote easily debunkable conspiracy theories, the FBI stating that there is no clear link between Trump and Russia, and Trump himself denying that he has any dealings with Russia, its fairly easy to see that the only thing there is to see here is an imploding campaign by the woman who  the last time she occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  claimed that her husbands impeachment was the result of a vast right-wing conspiracy. Some things never change. Photos: AP Images
Email The latest jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday morning was trumpeted as reflective of an improving economy. The Wall Street Journal said the report signal[ed] solid momentum in the labor market just days before American voters elect a new president, while Jeffry Bartash, writing for MarketWatch, said it shows the seven-year-old economic recovery still has plenty of life despite a slowdown in growth earlier in the year. A hard look behind the headline numbers  161,000 new jobs created in October and the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent  reveals a weak economy falling behind the numbers posted last year. First of all, that 161,000 number was below the 173,000 jobs estimated and predicted by Wall Street observers. Second, it was far below Septembers jobs growth of 191,000. Third, it brought the average monthly job growth for the year to just 181,000, compared to 229,000 per month for all of 2015. Additional data points proved the point: Big-picture numbers showed that the number of long-term employed (those jobless for 27 weeks of more) remained unchanged at two million, while the number of people employed part time for economic reasons (which the BLS calls involuntary part-time workers") was also unchanged. And so was the labor force participation rate, which remains stuck at 63 percent. In other words, of those available for work, 37 percent arent working. Putting that last number in perspective, at the beginning of Obamas first term, January 2009, just over 80 million Americans were not in the labor force. Today that number, reported by the BLS, is nearly 95 million. In other words, during the so-called recovery from the Great Recession, funded with massive government stimuli and bank bailouts that pushed the national debt toward $20 trillion, there are still more than 14 million people who were formerly in the labor force but who are no longer counted by the BLS. An even closer look reveals that, in October, 90,000 part-time jobs were created, while 103,000 full-time jobs were lost. The total number of employed people dropped by 43,000 last month while the number of unemployed people dropped even further, by 152,000. Taken all together, the BLS reports headlines showed a weak economy struggling to keep up with last year. Behind those headlines, however, it shows a weak economy getting weaker. If Hillary Clinton wins on Tuesday, and if she is able to pass her economic agenda, the economy will be further burdened with higher taxes on the job creators, with the money spent on public works projects. On the other hand, if Trump wins, and if he is able to pass his economic agenda, tax rates will drop sharply, the Trans-Pacific Partnership will be stalled, and millions of American taxpayer dollars currently flowing to the United Nations to support its global-warming agenda will stay in Washington. If the American economy can be likened to a race horse increasingly weighed down with taxes, mandates, and regulations, it will stumble under Clinton but might enjoy a renaissance under Trump.

1549 Views November 01, 2016 8 Comments Guest Posts  by Ghassan Kadi My American friend Roger is a staunch Democrat supporter. He is in his seventies and has always voted Democrat. Him and I have had countless discussions over the many years that we have known each other. His paternal roots are Arabic and he sees himself to be on the left side of politics, anti-Israel lobby, anti-Empire, but of late, him and I have not been able to see eye-to-eye on the Trump-Clinton race to the Whitehouse issue. He is with the view that Obama has inherited a financial and military disaster and did the best he could, and that he should not be blamed for his failure to perform as many did after his elaborate and successful yes we can slogan. He supported Obama-care and other domestic reform policies, and this is perhaps where Roger and I stop to agree and start to disagree. Many, including Roger, look at the appalling record of the Republican American Party and try to paint a tainted image of it. The party that is affectionately called the Grand Old Party or the GOP by its own staunch supporters certainly has enough such records to put it up there with charges of global mayhem and genocide. The GOP has given birth to monsters; people like Nixon, the Bushes, and of course, who can forget Dr. Kissinger? McCain is another character that comes to mind; one that no thinking man could trust with a dog, a Federal Senator who commands self-given authority that no one seems to be able to either understand the mandate of, or challenge. At the end of the infamous line Republican line, well at least thus far, enter Donald Trump. And what a character he is? Need one say more? God forbid if this article may be read like a defense of the GOP. The GOP is run by the rich and the privileged, and as described by George W. Bush himself, by the haves and have more. It is the party of Dick Cheney who saw in Iraq an opportunity to generate contracts for Haliburton. If tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis had to die for him to achieve his objective, he would not and did not blink. This is the party that condones and feeds Christian Zionists. It is the party that has huge control over the media. It is the party that runs the world like it is a business enterprise. Sadly, and whether the rest of the world likes it or not, until the current global status quo changes, no political party in the world affects the rest of the world like the ruling party in the United States. Whilst elections in other countries are by-and-large domestic affairs that affect domestic politics of the country concerned, American elections have implications that are not only domestically bound, but have a much further global reach that encompasses every corner of the world. As a non-American, personally, I am much more concerned about the wider global implications of American politics than the domestic ones. This is not to say that I am indifferent about America and the American people. As a matter of fact, not only do I have close friends who live in America, but also close family members there, and I have grave concerns for all mankind in every corner of the globe, by my interest in American politics remains focused on foreign policy matters; and to this effect, I am only able to relate to the choice between the major two American parties from the perspective of their foreign policies. As America insists to be the world police and the unrivalled superpower, a stature many Americans are refusing to accept that they have already lost, it must accept what comes with it and concede that the rest of the world is hoping that the American people will choose the better candidate as the new president; or should I say the one who is less harmful to the world. In between Donald and Hillary, who fits the less-harmful bill? This is the question. Enough has been recently said about Hillarys health to write a horror novel. Her mini-strokes and alleged recent case of pneumonia have made headlines as big, if not bigger than her infamous hidden emails, allegations of involvement in the murder of an American Ambassador and even selling arms to ISIS. Very recently however, the issue of the emails is resurfacing again, and very late in the campaign, perhaps late enough to serve Hillary with a knock out. However, her zeal to reach the Whitehouse seems to have been in her mind even before Bills (her husband) Monica scandal back in 1998. Hillary was prepared to publicly support Bill, appear to forgive him and move on, because she had a bigger fish to fry; the Whitehouse. She somehow managed to hush down all other sex offence allegations against Bill, all the while, and hypocritically, trying to score mileage from similar allegations against Trump. Her unabated lust for power will not stop at anything for as long as she ends up at the helm, the first female American President, even if she has to be Commander In Chief from behind the control button of a wheelchair. There are even observations and allegations that many people who have campaigned against her have died under suspicious circumstances. Whether this mystery is going to be taken up by main stream media just on the eve of the elections to serve her with yet another under-the-belt knock out remains to be seen. Her uncontrollable laughs and hysterical facial expressions leave many questions unanswered. In between the two front runners Donald and Hillary, it is hard to say that she presents herself as the sane and rational choice. Is there a party-based distinction on foreign affairs matters? Perhaps now, but not historically. For some reason, the American Republican Party is seen as the party of the hawks and the Democrats are seen as the doves. But are they? To answer this question in an unbiased manner, we ought to look back at history. Notwithstanding the colourful history of the GOP, the Bushes; father and son, Cheney, the NeoCons and Co., what is really the history of the American Democratic Party? A few landmark historical decisions make it very clear. So let us start with current events before we dwell into recent history that some might have chosen to forget. The War On Syria was the brainless child of the so-called Arab Spring, a spring that was heralded by the visit of an American President to Cairo and a speech he made to Sunni Muslim clergy at Al-Azhar University. The Presidents name is Barak Obama, and he is a Democrat. Obamas speech was a subtle endorsement for the Arab street, and to be specific to the Sunni Muslim Arab street to rise. The Maidan phenomenon and all the events that followed in Ukraine, the anti-Russian sanctions, escalations and intimidations and the creation of a very volatile situation in Europe; a situation that remains hot and of unpredictable consequences, have all been orchestrated by the same President; Obama .a Democrat. Last but not least, the current tension in the South China Sea is also the outcome of the same President, the incumbent Democrat; Barak Obama. Now, let us not forget that President Obama is a Nobel Prize laureate; ironically for peace. The American involvement in the Vietnam War started under the tenure of the sweetheart Hollywood-star like American President; JFK. It reached its climax during the LBJ administration. Both Kennedy and Johnson were Democrats. But all of the above monstrosity is dwarfed by dropping the A-Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Many strategists have argued over the last seven decades as to whether or not President Truman had no other choice to end the war quickly, but those arguments do not change the fact that two; not one, atom bombs were dropped on cities. It is pertinent to note here that the Manhattan Project generated two types of bombs, Little Boy (used in Hiroshima) and Fat Man (used in Nagasaki). It doesnt take a genius to at least suspect that the American administration wanted to test the two types and that therefore, in their eyes, destroying Hiroshima alone was not enough. That said, and even though no A-Bombs were dropped in Western Europe and specifically on Germany, the brutality that civilians in German towns and cities have suffered were simply acts of vengeance and many of them had no military gains to achieve. Harry Truman was not a Republican. He was yet another Democrat. But havent we forgotten the other Democrat sweetheart of the Whitehouse? The almost saint-in-waiting? The smiling Colgate-ad President Jimmy Carter. Many see that Carter had an impeccable record of being a humanitarian of the highest degree. As a matter of fact, credit must be given to him for his post-presidency peace campaigns, and specifically for standing up for the Palestinian people and for not being silenced by the Israel lobby. However, in reality, it was during the Carter administration that Al-Qaeda was created under the blessing and auspices of the USA. It was a criminal with a twisted mind aka Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carters National Security Advisor, who actually established the first Jihadist army. In his narrow-minded and short-sighted vision, he thought that the best way to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan was to support and train Islamist fighters to rise against the infidel Communists. And even though the plot eventually generated ISIS, a monster that turned not only against the hand the fed it but also against the whole world, to this date, Brzezinski maintains that he came up with a genius master plan. Once again, Carter and Brzezinski were both Democrats. And now, it is Clinton who is beating up the drums of war against Russia and China. Americans may have their legitimate preferences that would make them go either for Trump or for Clinton. Supporters of each team can and do provide huge lists that make their candidate of choice the better one. Arguably, one of them could well be better for America; the truth is that as a citizen of the world, and as mentioned before, I am more interested in a President who is better for the rest of the world. Whether Trump will trump up the military after an election win is anyones guess. But Clinton is beating the drums of war already. To this effect, and as we stand today, on the international arena, she is the hawk; not Trump. Americans who are disenchanted by wars must realize that this time around, the choice to vote Democrat is an endorsement of her war aspirations. Americans with two minds as to which way to go on the 8 th of this month ought to remember that whatever their personal, local and/or domestic issues are, the USA will not win a nuclear war against either Russia or China; let alone both combined. Those swinging voters who easily vote for either major party depending on an array of factors, should hopefully discern that this time that a vote for Clinton is a vote for war. If some have never voted for the GOP in the past, and more so are physically unable to vote for Trump, and/or if others are disenchanted by both major parties or actually never voted before, and if they regard both candidates as equally farcical, one would wonder as to what are waiting for to vote outside the two major parties? What caliber of Democrat and Republican candidates are such reluctant American voters waiting for to vote for a third option? Some argue that a vote for the Greens is a wasted vote because the Greens will never make it into the Whitehouse, at least not in the foreseeable future, but in reality, any vote that does not endorse Hillary Clinton is not a wasted vote.

1597 Views October 28, 2016 8 Comments Guest Posts  by Peter Koenig Imagine, Donald Trump would accede to the US Presidency, an unlikely event with the presstitute media relentlessly slamming, slashing and demonizing him, not unlike they do with President Putin  while cheering no-end for the warmonger Killary, no matter what atrocities she has on her hands and body, no matter that blood is dripping out of her mouth every time she opens it  like Iraq, Libya, Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan, Sudan  and more, much more. They, the elite, the military-security complex, the financial mafia, want more blood, more than is already covering the entire current Obama Administrations structure of psychopaths. Blood is weapons, blood is money, blood is more profit, blood is good for business  so said the Washington Post, just slightly translated from war is good for business. The warmongering MSM (mainstream media) also propagate for more weapons to enrich the military-security complex that pays them. But just for a moment, lets assume, Trump would get elected with such a large margin that voter fraud would be difficult to manage. Trump is sending a different narrative from that of eternal war. Trump seems to be looking into a different direction. He essentially says  stop the conflict with Russia, make Russia a partner, stop outsourcing jobs, bring them back, give labor back to Americans, slash the unemployment rate  which is, of course, everybody knows, way above the silly fabricated 5%. The reality is that unreported but real unemployment in the US is hovering between 22% and 25%, a real hammer for the economy, increasing anger and unhappiness and crime. Trump also says in the same vein as bringing back jobs  STOP globalization, restrain NATO, rein in the banks  yes, Wall Street, the Goldman Sachs-es and Co. of this world of fake pyramid money, dominated by the Rothschild-Rockefeller-Morgan clan. Trump says, lets have a financial system that works for the people. Does he mean it?  I dont know. Could be true. Most of what he says makes sense for America, for Americans  and by extension for much of the rest of the world, especially Europe, the genuine Europe, not the puppet-commandeered Europe. He also says a lot of outright discriminatory and xenophobic rubbish  like building a wall separating Mexico from the US of A, emulating Israel; and propagates a crackdown on Moslems. Does he mean it? Or does he want to please potential voters?  Such statements are indeed dangerous rubbish, but they are secondary to all the other things that are PRIORITARY, as they would help restore American society, workforce, dignity  most important: DIGNITY. Dignity is important for Americans to wake up to realize that they are living in a country that wastes their money, the peoples resources  on countless criminal wars around the world, feverishly racing towards Full Spectrum Dominance to benefit a few. The secondary stuff is important too, but can be dealt with in parallel by Americans that have come to senses. Trump is in many ways like Frances Marine LePen, representing the extreme right, and therefore, no matter what sensible things she says and has on her agenda to do  and I dont doubt one minute that she means what she says  like EUREXIT and send NATO to hell  she is still framed by the left intellectuals  if such a thing still exists in our neoliberal universe  as a discriminatory xenophobe who would expel all colored and veiled foreigners. Of course, thats bad. But let her first initiating France exiting from the EU, the Euro and NATO  the likely salvation of Europe, then tackle the other issues. First comes first. A true intellectual left would have to understand that  and not bend to the presstitute promoted clichs. Trump has enough money power. He doesnt have to bend to the military security complex, to the banks, to the Obamacare pharma-fiefdom. He doesnt really have to bend to anybody. That worries the elite. He is independent. Lets give him the benefit of the doubt. In no case could he be worse than Hillary  the killer  so much can be read from every word she says. Her pattern of pathology  We came, we saw, we won , when she saw the bloodstained image of the NATO-slaughtered Ghaddafi  indicates that she would not stop from pressing this infamous Red Button of Death and total world annihilation  perhaps even repeating that same smirk, , We came, we saw, we won . Now lets go to the next hypothesis, assuming Trump would be elected and they  the elusive high-powered small elite that pulls the strings on Washington and the White Houses overseas puppets, and lets assume they would let him live, at least for a while, Trump might be doing irrational things in the eye of the Beltway slaves. Recognizing the perils for his own country and those for his neighbor, Canada, Mr. Trump might call on the western stooges, in Europe particularly, who for the sake of brown-nosing the naked king in Washington, are prepared to sell-out 500-plus million European and their future generations to the most nefarious trade deals the world has ever known  CETA, TTIP and TiSA (let alone the TPP, where 12 Pacific countries are about to kiss ass in Washington)  telling them to come to senses, think democracy and stop the deals that 80% or more of Europeans despise and reject. As a parenthesis and philosophically speaking, one could say that given the hundreds of years of colonization around the globe, of shameless exploitation, of raping and killing millions of people throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America, that these trade deals are Europes historically deserved heritage.  wrote a great essay on the aberration of this upcoming election and what might follow after the election, The US Is About To Face The Worst Crisis in Their History  http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article45729.htm . One of the articles commenters pinned it down to the point:  If Trump does become Commander in Chief, his first job will be securing his life. Those who really run the show in the US will stop at nothing to safeguard their empire. Truly the US is at a cross roads and by extension the world. Times are really scary . What Trump says he would do during his first 100 days in office, he presented in a groundbreaking speech at Gettysburg, Pa. this past weekend, is for the most part truly astounding http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/10/24/donald-trump-delivers-a-powerful-policy-speech-on-his-first-100-days-in-office/ . It is not less than revolutionary, because no US politician, let alone a Presidential candidate or President has said something for the most part so sensible as did Presidential candidate Trump. Summarizing, he promises bringing back overseas jobs, would prevent the continued outsourcing of the American production processes, bring order to the crime-ridden communities, he would seek friendly partnership with Russia, defusing the WWIII threat  and he would tackle, restrain and control the corrupt banking system, including the endless money-making machine, the privately owned, Rothschild dominated FED.  That is a challenge other Presidents have failed to master, including Lincoln and JFK. We know how they ended. Trump has already hinted that to revive the American economy the zero-interest policy may have to be changed, so that banks become more responsible. The owners off the system would hardly allow Trumps interference in their obscene profit-making scheme. Theyd rather at their calling let the bomb loose. A sudden change of this policy would hit many over-stretched banks like a bombshell  reminiscent of 2008 Lehman Brothers, just magnified by a factor of 10. There are currently at least three, possibly five Wall Street giants that are on the edge. They get by, because of the FEDs zero interest policy- and they make sure that this doesnt change, as several if not all of them are part of the private FED system. Would Trump dare touching this system?  Its a deadly challenge. He knows it. This time there may be more at stake then just another banking collapse, a planned emulation of the 2007 / 2008 crisis, where Wall Street was copiously rewarded for its excesses by tax-money bail-outs. Be aware, this time it would not be tax-payers money that would rescue the Too-Big-To Fail (TBTF) banks, but it would be YOUR money, your deposits, your savings, your pension funds, possibly even your shares if you have any in the bank being collapsed  and the process would be called bail-ins. The (western) world is under the hegemon of a privately-owned money system, the US-dollar  and most people dont even know it. The accent is on the western world , because the east, comprising Russia, China, the SCO countries (Shanghai Cooperation Organization  comprising China and Russia and most of the Central Asian former Soviet Republics, plus Iran and Pakistan  and others are waiting in the wings), the EEU (Eurasian Economic Union), as well as most of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), are forming their own eastern economic and monetary block.  I have said this before, but will repeat it for readers to realize  this economic block  is largely, if not entirely, delinked from the dollar scheme. It consists of about half the worlds population and one third of the worlds GDP, a solid GDP that is. In contrast to the western, especially the US GDP; in the eastern block much of the GDP is based on real labor output and manufacturing. In reality, this eastern economic power block which is also displaying the worlds largest economic development potential, since history remembers, the New Silk Road  or the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) economic development scheme, stretching from Vladivostok to Lisbon (if Europe chooses to participate), does not need the west anymore. The OBOR project has already begun. It represents a view into the future, with job opportunities and the outlook for a truly better life for hundreds of millions, possibly billions of people during coming generations  a dynamic vision for the future. The east is where the future lays.- Donald Trump as President notwithstanding, a new western well-planned banking collapse may start in the US, the ramifications and impact would be felt around the globe  sinking millions, hundreds of millions of people into poverty, misery, the like we havent seen in recent history. The banks depositors money might not be enough. The reptiles are hungry. They might privatize public properties, infrastructures, roads, ports railways, health care, education, pensions, natural resources  anything that is still in the hands of the people. If Greece is a reminder, then think of Greece blown up by a factor of 1000  all around the globe, touching in extremis the vulnerable people of the vulnerable countries  billions of people. While the money flows again from the poor to the rich, to an ever-shrinking pool of super-rich; widening the rich-poor gap to a disgusting yawn. Leaving the 99.99 %  by now the 99. % ever more powerless, having to fend for sheer survival  seeking refuge in better lands  Its a war by money. Canons, bombs and guns could rest  for a while. For years, I have felt the Empire will have to be brought down from inside  from the people who cant take it anymore, from an internal revolt that eventually would break the worldwide extended monsters back. Rome and most subsequent empires have fallen this way. It may still happen. But now I side more with s theory, namely that the defeat may come from a combination of inside revolt and outside forces, not so much military forces, but economic forces. In theory, it could happen tomorrow. Just imagine, the one third of world-GDP-countries would drop all their dollar reserves, all the dollar denominated international contracts, all dollar issued trade agreements  and in particular, abandon at once the unwritten rule of hydrocarbons to be traded only in US-dollars. It would most likely wipe out the western economy. This will not happen, of course. Simply, because the One Third GDP holders do not want to destroy the economy of the rest of the world, especially the so-called developing and emerging countries, many  or most of them  eventually to become allies of this eastern block that promises peaceful co-existence rather than the current western pattern of ever multiplying wars and conflicts  a sheer dollar-fed killing spree, with destruction and weapons manufacturing no end. The Power of Money. Would Donald Trump, as President, himself a moneyed powerhouse, survive such a calamity? In fact, would he be able and strong enough to veer the ship around, guiding the world away from such destructive scenarios and towards peace and cooperation between East and West?  Or is the train already too far out of the station?  No telling at this time. The signals are certainly not good. But, lets put in a grain of optimism and bank on a positive strand of dynamics fueled by an increasing human consciousness  one that would not allow Hillary to push the Death Button.

Search   Topics: Donald Trump , 2016 Presidential Election , presidential politics Wednesday, 26 October 2016 A leaked transcript of a White house meeting reveals plans to lure the country's Trump Voters to Florida on election day and wall them in to help ensure the peaceful transfer of power. Voice #1: "The traditional peaceful transfer of power after a presidential election, fundamental to our democracy, is in jeopardy. What happens if Trump somehow wins? Will Barrack and Hilary say they were just kidding about him being a truly dangerous unfit con artist and no hard feelings about that 5 year long race baiting Birther movement as US military leaders walk over to Trump with the nuclear codes?" Voice #2: "Trump will probably lose. Still, that doesn't guarantee a peaceful transition. Trump's already convinced a majority of his supporters the election is illegitimate if he loses. He's recruiting voting station vigilantes. Trump supporter sheriff David Clarke from Milwaukee said its time for 'pitch forks and torches. How many of Trump's gun loving hard core base might do something violent?" Voice #1: "I'm just thinking out loud, but what if we announce that to offset the rigged election, Trump negotiated a deal in which anyone that casts a Trump vote in Florida will have it counted as two votes from their home state. Then, we announce the greatest Trump rally of all time on election day in Florida; the largest NASCAR event; the largest Harley Davidson motorcycle convention, free assault rifles handed out as they cross the border..." Voice #2: "Where are you going with this?" Voice #1: "We lure hard core Trump voters in to Florida; get them packed in there; and then quickly unfurl a razor wire fence along the state's north border stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic Ocean. Then, we start construction of the real wall right next to it. That's a wall Mexico might be willing to pay for." Voice #2: "What about the Hillary supporters in Florida?" Voice #1: "We'd have to get them out somehow. Give them incentives to vote in South Carolina, or airlift them out of Florida after the election." Voice #2: "If it worked, it would get crowded down there in Florida." Voice # 1: "We could promise Trump supporters free housing." Voice #4: "Yes. We can put them in tent cities modeled after Syrian refugee camps." Voice #1: "I'm trying to be serious." Voice #4: "The Red Cross might pay for that tent city; just tell them we're quarantining people to stop the spread of a resurgent xenophobe epidemic." Voice #2: "What about after the election? It's not like we can just let them back in after the peaceful transfer of power. They're going to be upset for a while." Voice #4: "We could let a few of them back in every year. They'd have to go through 'extreme vetting'. As immigrants re-entering the upper 49, we'd need assurances they'd developed American values like tolerance for different religions and ethnicities." Voice #1: "We'll worry about what to do with them later. First we have to lure them down there." Voice #4: "What about appealing to Trump voter anti-elitism? We could tell them Florida universities will be shut down and demolished." Voice #1: "Not fair. A lot of Trump supporters want to send their kids to college." Voice #4: "They can go to Trump University." Voice #2: "Trump University doesn't have real academics." Voice #4: "We'll create some. We'll appoint Trump surrogate Katrina Pierson as chair of the 'Revisionist History Department.' Scholarly emphasis will be on how Obama and then secretary of state Hilary got us in to Afghanistan and Iraq and founded ISIS. Scottie Nell Hughes will head up the 'Ethics in Media' department. Rudy Giuliani can head the 'Institute for study of Giuliani's heroic role after the 9/11 attacks." Voice #1: "If you don't have anything practical to..." Voice #4: "We could say Trump supporters wearing T-shirts saying "Hillary sucks, but not as good as Monica", or "Trump that Bitch," will get preferential seating at the rally. If they also claim to hate Muslim societies because of how awful they treat their women, they also get to meet Trump backstage." Voice #2: "One thing. If we actually do this, Marco Rubio is not getting out of Florida. And he thought that his little cowardly Trump endorsement video at the GOP convention wasn't going to haunt him." Voice #1: "What about Healthcare in post-election day Florida? People with MD degrees are mostly Hilary supporters. There won't be many doctors down there." Voice #2: "They'll have Ben Carson." Voice #4: "We could also send in Harold Bornstein, that doctor who wrote the fake Trump medical statement in 5 minutes. Bornstein can claim that everyone's health in Florida is astonishingly excellent; the best he's ever seen'. That way, nobody has to get any treatments." Voice #1: "Seriously, what about emergencies like gunshot wounds, heart attacks..." Voice #4: "Dr. Oz could hang out in emergency rooms and sell DVDs of his show." Voice #2: "How would post-election Florida be governed?" Voice #4: "Offer Vladimir Putin a governorship. Tell him he can put a few short range nuclear missals in Cuba; like ones that could only reach Tallahassee; as long as Governor Putin agrees to act with stronger leadership than the weak soft president Obama. And since Trump thinks the American media is so awful, Putin could help him reform Florida laws on journalists and free speech." Voice #2: "Would Florida get any federal money?" Voice #4: "Definitely would need some kind of Florida 'Trump tax'. This extra money would be used to offset the lack of taxes paid by Trump himself. The rest of the money would go to Trump's charity to fund any Trump purchases of autographed football helmets of evangelical athletes, or portraits of himself." Voice #2: "We could lure Trump voters to Florida with promises of VA reforms." Voice #4: "Yes. Then when they're walled in, we announce that POW military pensions will be cut in half because they let the country down by getting caught. We'll name it the 'Pathetic John McCain Endorsement of Trump VA Penalty." Voice #2: "Stop. What kind of real changes would draw Trump voters to Florida?" Voice #1: "We could tell them Florida will have the strictest bathroom laws; that correct gender will be checked by DNA analysis before anyone's allowed in a public bathroom." Voice #4: "Then, once their walled in, we'll project holograms of naked transsexuals standing next to every urinal and toilet." Voice #1: "We could lure them by saying how great the Florida beaches are." Voice #4: "Yes. Then, when in there we mandate a statewide program; a photo of every woman who puts on a bathing suit will be posted online with a video of Trump critiquing her body." Voice #1: "How do we get evangelical Trump supporters down there?" Voice #4: "We could say we're converting all Florida planned parenthood operations in to 'defense of marriage clinics' where homosexuals can be sent for conversion therapy. Anyone caught performing or having an abortion would be subject to the death penalty. Then, on Sundays as families enter churches, we'll play a looped audio tape of Trump bragging he can grab any woman's pussy he wants. Weigh stations will be set up at random pedestrian intersections. All females will be weighed. A database tracking weight gain will be publicly available. Biggest weekly gainers will be forced to exercise at a televised press conference as Trump mocks them while eating a McDonald's hamburger. Any Trump tweets between the hours of 3 and 5 AM will set off warning alarms in every Florida cell phone. The tweet will then be read by the phones voice robot until the user takes the battery out. On a 24 video channel, every Trump female voter in Florida cheated on by a male partner must explain why she enabled his infidelity. Then she must apologize to the women her partner cheated with, in case they were made to feel insulted or uncomfortable. I don't think it would hurt to build some David Duke statues in Florida. 1. They might increase Trump white supremacist voter presence. 2. They might remind Trump who David Duke is; in case somebody on TV asks him if he would denounce David Duke or the KKK. Ben Carson and Pastor Mark Burns can unveil the David Duke statues. On every female Florida drivers license, there will be a section filled in by Trump marked either 'yes' or 'no' indicating whether Trump thinks the woman is attractive enough to be groped sexually without consent. A memorial will be built at the site of the Orlando nightclub massacre. We'll erect a large lit up plastic trump face smiling next to a sign that reads 'Thanks for all your congratulations on me predicting this mass shooting by Obama backed Islamic radicals..."

Topics: 2016 Presidential Election , trumphole , Mark Zuckerberg Friday, 11 November 2016 Don't blame me I made plenty of money out of the election as ZuckerNazi arrongantly dismisses his social responsiblity After the election result was a complete shock to decent Americans it has come to light it was Zuckerbergs GREED that got the Trumphole elected. Everyone knows how the new Emperor manipulated the media space with constant lies and trump eting fake news stories that whipped normally sensible people into emotional frenzies completely lacking any factual basis. Emperor Trumpholes back room spinners are said to be rolling on the floor in laughter. "What a bunch of suckers" they chortled. "All we had to do was seed facetube with a whole lot of crap and then watch it become 'fact'. The emperor would then spruke it in his next rally and we were able to completely fabricate reality for most Americans". Social commentators are collectively in outrage this morning as the ZuckerNazi denies it was his fault. I don't understand the problem he screamed at reporters, "I made plenty of money out of the election, whats the problem? The fact that democracy and decency were collateral damage isn't my problem". Some where outraged that despite 40% of the news (none of it validated) drove the Trumpholes victory he is essentially dismissing any complicity. "Americans are essentially stupid and will believe any hate laden crap, if it wasn't me it would be someone else, so better i make the money than another guy, thats what makes us america great", he laughed. When asked why he didn't use editors to check fake news stories he laughed and replied, "we tried that but it cost me money and decreased profits so i canned it, after all clickbaiting is great for profit".

Tuesday, 1 November 2016 Back in those days, Bill would do anything to get away from Hillary's watchful eyes. Gross, Nebraska From the campaign trail, Trump delivered the news that he said has recently been discovered by historians hired by the Trump organization, that Bill Clinton was, in fact, Jack the Ripper! "We have learned of some documents that will irretrievably prove that, while he was President of the United States, Bill Clinton used a prototype of a time machine invented by a consortium of Linus Pauling, Stephen Hawking, and Brian Mays in the 1990s to go back to the 18th Century, in the Whitechapel area of London, to commit the Jack the Ripper murders. "In fact, when we submit the proof, I think you'll all agree that it couldn't be anyone else!" trumpeted Trump. Make Al N.'s
 Posted on Tweet (Image via comicvine.com) Alarmed by the rampant killing of stray dogs in Kerala, the All Kerala Mahasangh of Street Dogs (AKMSD) has called in their trump car, Krypto, to save them from marauding humans. Krypto, as you might know is the Super Dog, from Krypton. Doggie Nair, the chairdog of AKMSD says that Krypto is their last hope. Nobody else seems to be doing anything for us, irrespective of Menaka Gandhi voicing her support. By the way, I didnt know she was from BJP  I thought all Gandhis were from Congress, and thought she would help, but alas! he said. According to sources, the AKMSD had even reached out to President Vladimir Putin during the recent BRICS summit to see how Russia interacts with stray dogs. Moved by their plight, Putin had called upon the Kerala CM and had referenced Kashtanka, the Russian children story by Anton Chekhov about stray dogs, and tried to argue their case. However, the Kerala CM was unmoved, and said that constant attacks from POK (Patti Occupied Kerala) [Patti in Malayalam  Dogs] was not acceptable, and he would keep conducting his surgical stikes attacks. (Off the record: He says the leadership in Kerala still try avoid the strike word, else the GDP of Kerala would drop a few basis points). I should have gone to school, when I was young, rued Doggie Nair. Then I would also be in Kareena Kapoor or Shilpa Shettys lap, but now look at my job! Im living a dogs life! We feel for these dogs, and hope a real life Krypto comes to the rescue. (Reported by  Badri Narayanan )
Barack Obama has been out campaigning on behalf of Hillary Clinton the last month or so trying to help his investment, Hillary Clinton. As the race has heated up with the FBI reopening their investigation into Hillary Clintons emails, Hillary Clinton and her camp are starting to go crazy trying to find ways to combat the Trump Train that is about to leave them in the dust. Via USAPolitics First Hillary Clinton snapped at a protester at one of her rallies that shouted, Bill Clinton is a rapist, having him escorted out after his remarks. Now Obama is losing control and this time on a veteran. Yes, thats right. A veteran!Barack Obama doesnt deserve to be Commander-in-Chief if hes going to belittle the people that he sends into battle and harms way. An image of the Trump supporter protesting can be seen below.Here's the pro-Trump protester who interrupted Obama rally pic.twitter.com/gbwzT3i1zU  Josh Lederman (@joshledermanAP) November 4, 2016 Whats even worse it that right before he belittled this great American patriot, he was insulting trump for making fun of American POWs, most notably John McCain.Obama lost complete control after that screaming:Hey, he, hey, hey, hey!! HOLD UP! SIT DOWN! Im speaking! BE QUIET!! HOLD UP! He seems a bit desperate for attention to me.Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are losing control and they cant stand to see it. They are going to try everything in their power to cheat the system and probably try and rig the election so that they can maintain their power because they are connected on so many levels.You can hear the screams and protests in the video above. Obama cant even control a crowd let alone an entire country. This cant be allowed to happen. We have to stop them for good and clean up the corrupt swamp that Washington has become.
It has been claimed that Nostradamus prophesied Donald Trumps surprise victory as President of the United States five centuries ago, putting to shame modern pollsters. The famous French medical practitioner and seer has been credited for predicting major world events and his followers claim he foresaw Donald Trumps victory. However, the end is nigh because as at the same time, Nostradamus also predicted that Trumps presidency would herald the the end of the world.The ancient prophet refers to president-elect Donald Trump as the false trumpet who will one day engage in military adventures to force Byzantium to change its laws, which in turn would lead to the Apocalypse. The false trumpet concealing madness will cause Byzantium to change its laws, Nostradamus predicted over four hundred years ago.While many were surprised by the billionaires victory in the 2016 US election, followers of Nostradamus would not have been, claiming the prophesier predicted this in the 16th century.In Century III, Quatrain 81, Nostradamus wrote: The great shameless, audacious bawler. He will be elected governor of the army: The boldness of his contention. The bridge broken, the city faint from fear.Many believe that the shameless, audacious bawler part refers to Mr Trumps loud communication, while governor of the army refers to being in charge of the worlds leading military force. In Century 1, 40, another prediction reads: The false trumpet concealing madness will cause Byzantium to change its laws.Byzantium was an Ancient Greek colony  some have connected this to the fact Greece is becoming a landing spot for immigrants and refugees, a topic that has been at the center of Mr Trumps candidacy.Finally, in Quatrain 50, Nostradamus writes the Republic of the big city will engage in costly military operations, ordered by the trumpet, which has led to fears of nuclear war. One user wrote on Facebook: I pretty sure this is the start to Nostradamus prediction of the Apocalypse.Another posted: Nostradamus predicted this outcome. Nostradamus predicted after the trumpet wins, there will be a Great War! He predicted this 400 yrs ago! His prediction have all come true! Im afraid America is going fall, compare us to Roma, we have to much debt, and we import more than we export, we are in serious trouble.
Paid instigators are making an already bad situation much much worse. As riots and protests rage through the streets of America, the question has to be asked. Via ActivistPost Does someone behind the scenes want to see civil war in the United States? The answer is almost certainly yes.And it isnt likely to settle down anytime in the next few days. (If you arent prepped for this, go here to learn how to stay safe.) Just a little background: this has been going on since the midst of the campaign when actors were hired on Craigslist and trained to disrupt rallies. For example, one Craigslist ad was answered by Paul Horner, who admitted he was paid $3,500 to cause a scene at a Trump event in Fountain Hills, Arizona.As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clintons campaign, Horner said. The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called Women Are The Future. After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is. Horner continued, It was mostly women in their 60s at the interview that I went to  (source)The same report goes on to say:When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally.Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos $500, Muslims $600 and African Americans $750. I dont think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received $300 across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years backYou can also read this article, in which a quote caught on video from Project Veritas shows how the Clinton campaign caused disruptions via bird-dogging.Theres a lot of evidence that someone is funding these protests. An eyewitness in Austin, Texas spotted protesters being transported by chartered coach buses.Anti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem. Here are the busses they came in. #fakeprotests #trump2016 #austin pic.twitter.com/VxhP7t6OUI erictucker (@erictucker) November 10, 2016Then there was this Craigslist ad.There are many more tweets along these lines, but suffice it to say, suspicion is high that these, just like the Clinton campaign, are rigged to manipulate the American people.Why would anyone want to cause all this trouble? Thats where the web gets tangled. It certainly seems counterproductive to set fire to America. After all, what these people are doing is likely to end up with more tyranny  like martial law, for example.Exactly. Thats precisely the plan.Back in August, hackers from a group called DC Leaks got into the private documents of the Open Society, an organization founded by George Soros. Soros, whom DC Leaks referred to as the architect and sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years is a pro-globalist billionaire who has been trying to take over the world via shadow government for decades.Zero Hedge reported on the findings in the Soros leak:The documents are from multiple departments of Soros organizations. Soros the Open Society Foundations seems to be the group with the most documents in the leak. Files come from sections representing almost all geographical regions in the world, from the USA, to Europe, Eurasia, Asia, Latin, America, Africa, the World Bank the Presidents Office, as well as an unknown entity named SOUK. As the Daily Caller notes, there are documents dating from at least 2008 to 2016.Documents in the leak range from research papers such as EUROPEAN CRISIS: Key Developments of the Past 48 Hours focusing on the impact of the refugee crisis, to a document titled The Ukraine debate in Germany, to an update specific financials of grants.They reveal work plans, strategies, priorities and other activities by Soros, and include reports on European elections, migration and asylum in Europe.An email leaked by WikiLeaks earlier this week showed Soros had advised Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State on how to handle unrest in Albania  advice she acted on. As well, its important to note that Soros provided a whopping $33 million to activists in Ferguson, Missouri, escalating a protest to a siege. The Washington Times reported: liberal billionaire George Soros, who has built a business empire that dominates across the ocean in Europe while forging a political machine powered by nonprofit foundations that impacts American politics and policy, not unlike what he did with MoveOn.org. Mr. Soros spurred the Ferguson protest movement through years of funding and mobilizing groups across the U.S., according to interviews with key players and financial records reviewed by The Washington Times.In all, Mr. Soros gave at least $33 million in one year to support already-established groups that emboldened the grass-roots, on-the-ground activists in Ferguson, according to the most recent tax filings of his nonprofit Open Society Foundations  This is business as usual for the OSF (Open Society Foundation), as explained by director Kenneth Zimmerman:Mr. Zimmerman said OSF has been giving to these types of groups since its inception in the early 90s, and that, although groups involved in the protests have been recipients of Mr. Soros grants, they were in no way directed to protest at the behest of Open Society.The incidents, whether in Staten Island, Cleveland or Ferguson, were spontaneous protests  we dont have the ability to control or dictate what others say or choose to say, Mr. Zimmerman said. But these circumstances focused peoples attention  and it became increasingly evident to the social justice groups involved that what a particular incident like Ferguson represents is a lack of accountability and a lack of democratic participation.Soros-sponsored organizations helped mobilize protests in Ferguson, building grass-roots coalitions on the ground backed by a nationwide online and social media campaign. Other Soros-funded groups made it their job to remotely monitor and exploit anything related to the incident that they could portray as a conservative misstep, and to develop academic research and editorials to disseminate to the news media to keep the story alive.The plethora of organizations involved not only shared Mr. Soros funding, but they also fed off each other, using content and buzzwords developed by one organization on anothers website, referencing each others news columns and by creating a social media echo chamber of Facebook likes and Twitter hashtags that dominated the mainstream media and personal online newsfeeds.Soros was busted for paying protesters to go into Ferguson and stir things up. This is not theory. Its FACT. The Daily Mail reported that Soros spent $33 million to bankroll the protests. The Washington Times reported that it was totally cool, though, because humanitarian that he is, Soros just wanted to help the civil rights movement. What a guy. Of course, this seems to be a thing with the kabillionaires. The Ford Foundation and Rockefeller foundation also fund social activism. Which is kabillionaire code for mess stuff up and wreak havoc.And guess who footed the bill for the rent-a-thug protesters at Trump rallies in California and New York? (Heres another source, too.) You guessed it. Everyones favorite Hungarian-American troll. Keep in mind that the organization Black Lives Matter was born through the Ferguson riots.Does this look familiar? If the Modus Operandi in these protests looks familiar, thats because MoveOn.org is organizing a lot of them, and MoveOn is funded by you guessed it: George Soros. The organization was originally founded to combat the impeachment of Bill Clinton are you seeing a link here? Another proud instigator is the Answer Coalition which also  are you sitting down? Has links to Soros.There are a lot of people who are out there because they genuinely oppose a Trump presidency. The unfortunate thing is, their opposition comes from propaganda that they passionately believe. They are acting based on misinformation and theyre being professionally manipulated. The next step here is martial law, which nobody wants.Well, nobody except George Soros and friends. Someone who wants to see America ripped apart is causing this division. Last summer, it was leaked that Soros attempted to destabilize Russia and depose Putin in 2012. Putin responded by banning Soros and all of his organizations from Russia. In 2014, Putin issued an international arrest warrant for Soros. We could certainly improve both international relationships and our current situation by extraditing Soros immediately.
They call it The Hum, a phrase coined by the geo-scientist David Deming of the University of Oklahoma to describe the mysterious and untraceable sound that is heard in certain locations around the world by two to ten percent of the population. The noises might vary from roaring sounds in the middle of the night, to prolonged periods of noise which sound like intense industrial activity taking place in the sky. Most unusually of all, ordinary people in cities such as York in England have claimed to hear trumpet horns coming from the sky playing chilling bars of music.Scroll Down For Videos Below! Now Slovakia has become the latest location to these bizarre and completely inexplicable noises, which have been recorded on video.As of yet, no one has been able to offer a completely coherent explanation for these mysterious sounds. Some have suggested that the chilling noises might be caused by changes in the Earths core which could eventually lead to a complete polar shift. However, aside from speculation, there is little evidence to suggest that this particular theory is true. According to Deming, they may well be caused by enormous amounts of collated feedback from telephone transmissions and aircraft which are operated by the United States Navy to communicate with submarines. However, this explanation is deemed to fall short as these noises became particularly apparent in 2011 and 2012 and if Deming is correct, there should have been previous indications of this feedback reaction before this period.Some people have suggested that the noise could be being caused by projects such as the HAARP weapons program, which is believed to be dedicated to working on high-tech weather modification technology.If this explanation is correct, it could not explain not only the unusual noises but also why they are so often accompanied by a bizarre phenomenon in the sky, such as those which have been detected in Slovakia in recent months.
 November 09, 2016  Republican Donald Trump stunned the world by defeating heavily favored rival Hillary Clinton in Tuesday's presidential election, ending eight years of Democratic rule and sending the United States on a new, uncertain path. A wealthy real estate developer and former reality TV host, Trump rode a wave of anger toward Washington insiders to win the White House race against Clinton, the Democratic candidate whose gold-plated establishment resume included stints as a first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state. President Barack Obama, who campaigned hard against Trump, telephoned the Republican to congratulate him on his victory and invited him to the White House for a meeting on Thursday, the White House said in a statement. Obama is due to speak later on Wednesday about the election. "Ensuring a smooth transition of power is one of the top priorities the President identified at the beginning of the year and a meeting with the President-elect is the next step," the White House said. Worried that a Trump victory could cause economic and global uncertainty, investors were in full flight from risky assets. The U.S. dollar, Mexican peso and world stocks fell on Wednesday but fears of the kind of shock that wiped trillions of dollars off global markets after Britain's "Brexit" vote in June have failed to materialize so far. Trump collected enough of the 270 state-by-state electoral votes needed to win a four-year term that starts on Jan. 20, taking battleground states where presidential elections are traditionally decided, U.S. television networks projected. He appeared with his family before cheering supporters in a New York hotel ballroom, saying it was time to heal the divisions caused by the campaign and find common ground after a campaign that exposed deep differences among Americans. "It is time for us to come together as one united people," Trump said. "I will be president for all Americans." He said he had received a call from Clinton to congratulate him on the win and praised her for her service and for a hard-fought campaign. His comments were an abrupt departure from his campaign trail rhetoric in which he repeatedly slammed Clinton as "crooked" amid supporters' chants of "lock her up." Republicans also kept control of the U.S. Congress. Television networks projected the party would retain majorities in both the 100-seat Senate and the House of Representatives, where all 435 seats were up for grabs. Despite losing the state-by-state electoral battle that determines the U.S. presidency, Clinton narrowly led Trump in the nationwide popular vote, according to U.S. media tallies. It would mark the second time in 16 years that a Democratic candidate lost the presidency despite winning more votes than the victor. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore got more votes than Republican George W. Bush. At Clinton's election event a mile away from Trump's victory party, an electric atmosphere among supporters expecting to see her become America's first woman president dissipated. Clinton did not immediately make a concession speech, instead sending campaign chairman John Podesta out to tell her supporters to go home. "We're not going to have anything more to say tonight," he said. Clinton was expected to speak on Wednesday morning, an aide said. Prevailing in a cliffhanger race that opinion polls had clearly forecast as favoring a Clinton victory, Trump won avid support among a core base of white non-college educated workers with his promise to be the "greatest jobs president that God ever created." He did well in "Rust Belt" states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. "Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before," Trump wrote on Twitter early on Wednesday. In his victory speech, he said he had a great economic plan, would embark on a project to rebuild American infrastructure and would double U.S. economic growth. Trump, who at 70 will be the oldest first-term U.S. president, came out on top after a bitter and divisive campaign that focused largely on the character of the candidates and whether they could be trusted in the Oval Office. The presidency will be Trump's first elected office, and it remains to be seen how he will work with Congress. During the campaign Trump was the target of sharp disapproval, not just from Democrats but from many in his own party. STUNNED WORLD Foreign leaders pledged to work with Trump but some officials expressed alarm that the vote could mark the end of an era in which Washington promoted democratic values and was seen by its allies as a guarantor of peace. During the campaign, Trump expressed admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, questioned central tenets of the NATO military alliance and suggested that Japan and South Korea should develop nuclear weapons to shoulder their own defense burden. Trump has promised to warm relations with Russia that have chilled under Obama over Russia's intervention in the Syrian civil war and its seizure of Ukraine's Crimea region. Governments in Britain, China, Germany, Israel, Japan and Turkey, as well as Russia, congratulated Trump and said they would work with him. "It is not an easy path but we are ready to do our part and do everything to return Russian and American relations to a stable path of development," Putin said. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped to reach "new heights" in bilateral ties underTrump. Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing and Washington shared responsibility for promoting global development and prosperity. Other officials, some of them with senior roles in government, took the unusual step of denouncing the outcome, calling it a worrying signal for liberal democracy and tolerance in the world. "Trump is the pioneer of a new authoritarian and chauvinist international movement. He is also a warning for us," German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said in an interview with the Funke newspaper group. U.S. neighbor Mexico was pitched into deep uncertainty by the victory for Trump, who has often accused it of stealing U.S. jobs and sending criminals across the border. Trump wants to rewrite international trade deals to reduce trade deficits and has taken positions that raise the possibility of damaging relations with America's most trusted allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. The Mexican peso plunged more than 13 percent before recovering some ground. The peso had become a touchstone for sentiment on the election as Trump threatened to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico. Trump's win raises a host of questions for the United States at home and abroad. He campaigned on a pledge to take the country on a more isolationist, protectionist "America First" path. He has vowed to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods exported to the United States by U.S. companies that went abroad. CLINTON'S WEAKNESSES Trump survived a series of seemingly crippling blows on the campaign, many of them self-inflicted, including the emergence in October of a 2005 video in which he boasted about making unwanted sexual advances on women. He apologized but within days, several women emerged to say he had groped them, allegations he denied. He was judged the loser of all three presidential debates with Clinton. A Reuters/Ipsos national Election Day poll offered some clues to the outcome. It found Clinton badly underperformed expectations with women, winning their vote by only about 2 percentage points. And while she won Hispanics, black and young voters, Clinton did not win those groups by greater margins than Obama did in 2012. Younger blacks did not support Clinton like they did Obama, as she won eight of 10 black voters between the ages of 35 and 54. Obama won almost 100 percent of those voters in 2012. During the campaign, Trump said he would "make America great again" through the force of his personality, negotiating skill and business acumen. He proposed refusing entry to the United States of people from war-torn Middle Eastern countries, a modified version of an earlier proposed ban on Muslims. His volatile nature, frequent insults and unorthodox proposals led to campaign feuds with a long list of people, including Muslims, the disabled, Republican U.S. Senator John McCain, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, the family of a slain Muslim-American soldier, a Miss Universe winner and a federal judge of Mexican heritage. A largely anti-Trump crowd of about 400 to 500 people gathered outside the White House after his victory, many shocked or in tears. Some carried signs that read "stand up to racism" and "love trumps hate." About a dozen Trump supporters began shouting "U-S-A" and the competing demonstrators briefly pushed each other. The election was unprecedented in the way it turned Americans against each other, according to dozens of interviews in rural United States and across some of the most politically charged battleground states. Throughout his campaign - and especially in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in July - Trump described a dark America that had been knocked to its knees by China, Mexico, Russia and Islamic State. The American dream was dead, he said, smothered by malevolent business interests and corrupt politicians, and he alone could revive it. He has vowed to win economic concessions from China and to build a wall on the southern U.S. border with Mexico to keep out undocumented immigrants. His triumph was a rebuke to Obama, a Democrat who spent weeks flying around the country to campaign against him, repeatedly casting doubt on his suitability for the White House. Obama will hand over the office to Trump after serving the maximum eight years allowed by law. Trump promises to push Congress to repeal Obama's troubled healthcare plan and to reverse his Clean Power Plan. He plans to create jobs by relying on U.S. fossil fuels such as oil and gas. Trump's victory marked a frustrating end to the presidential aspirations of Clinton, 69, who failed for the second time to be president. In a posting on Twitter during Tuesday evening, she acknowledged a battle that was unexpectedly tight given her edge in opinion polls going into Election Day. "This team has so much to be proud of. Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything," she tweeted. The wife of former President Bill Clinton, she held a steady lead in many opinion polls for months. Voters perceived in her a cautious and calculating candidate and an inability to personally connect with them. Even though the FBI found no grounds for criminal charges after a probe into her use of a private email server rather than a government system while she was secretary of state, the issue allowed critics to raise doubts about her integrity. Hacked emails also showed a cozy relationship between her State Department and donors to her family's Clinton Foundation charity. Trump seized on the emails to charge that Clinton represented a corrupt political system in Washington that had to be swept clean. News contribution by Reuters , Commentary by TRUNEWS

 Posted on Oct 27, 2016 ( WikiMedia ) In a television commercial that the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) ran for years, PBS NewsHour host Gwen Ifill declared that she loved her job because it allowed her to ask not only all of my questions but also and more importantly all of your questions . This assertion was and remains absurd, just like her networks regular fundraising claim to be free of corporate sponsors. The claim has long been contradicted by the string of corporate-image commercials (purchased by leading financial, defense, auto, insurance and rail corporations) that appear before the networks nightly NewsHour broadcastalong with a list of corporate-sponsored foundations and superwealthy individuals who pay for the show, along with regular viewers like you. Consistent with those commercials and despite its name, the news and commentary one finds on PBS is in rich tune with the narrow capitalist parameters of acceptable coverage and debate that typify the more fully and explicitly for-profit and commercialized corporate media. As progressive journalist David Sirota suggested two years ago , reflecting on recent investigations showing that supermoneyed, right-wing capitalists such as the Koch brothers and Texas billionaire John Arnold had (along with more liberal software mogul Bill Gates) influenced PBS content through multimillion-dollar donations, the P in PBS often seems to more properly stand for Plutocratic, not Public. None of this should be surprising to anyone familiar with the distinctively big-business-dominated history of U.S. broadcast media . Because the United States fails to provide anything like adequate funding for public broadcasting, both PBS and National Public Radio (a regular vehicle for neoliberal business ideology) depend upon foundations, corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for much of their programming. Beneath their standard claims to have no interest in shaping public media content, these private funders have bottom-line agendas, meaning that their contributions come with strings attachedstrings that undermine the integrity of the independent journalism they bankroll. (For what its worth, between 1994 and 2014, the NewsHour was primarily owned by the for-profit firm Liberty Media . Liberty Media was run by the conservative and politically active billionaire John Malone, who had a majority stake in MacNeil/Lehrer Productions, the shows producer.) The Pentagon Broadcasting System? What might seem more surprising, perhaps, is the remarkable extent to which the P in PBS often seems to stand for Pentagon, or perhaps Presidential, when it comes to foreign policy content. Whatever the global issue of the day or week, NewsHour anchors and their invited experts can be counted on to report and reflect in accord with the doctrinal assumption that Washington always operates with the best of intentions. They almost uniformly treat the U.S. as a great, benevolent and indispensable force for freedom, democracy, security, peace and order in a dangerous world full of evil and deadly actors. The shows invited commentators are drawn primarily from the nations imperial establishment. They are commonly current or retired insiders from within the Pentagon, the White House, the intelligence community and/or the nations elite network of foreign policy think tanks: the Council on Foreign Relations (the granddaddy of all U.S. ruling-class think tanks ), the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Aspen Institute, the Atlantic Council, the Rand Corp. and the Hoover Institution, to name a handful. NewsHour anchors and guests generally agree that the United States officially designated enemies are malevolent bad guys who need to be contained, controlled and even attacked by the ultimate good guy, Uncle Sam. Not surprisingly, the long and ongoing record of U.S. imperial arrogance and criminality (more on that below) is swept down George Orwells memory hole even as new entries are added to the ugly registry. When reported by the NewsHour, horrific crimes committed by the U.S. military are always treated as well-intended mistakes. Along with the rest of the mainstream U.S. media, the NewsHour insist[s] that Russia deliberately bombs hospitals, etc., whereas if we do it, it is, of course, an accident . Theres some room for disagreement between and among the shows invited expertsincluding the shows semi-loopy foreign policy authority, Margaret Warnerabout specific U.S. foreign policy tactics, strategies and actions. Theres no space for serious debate about the immorality, lawlessness or imperial nature of that policy. On the rare occasions NewsHour anchors seem to challenge guests from the White House or Pentagon on foreign policy matters, it is generally to ask why the U.S. isnt going harder at the officially certified bad guys. America as Umpire, Not Empire The foreign policy coverage and commentary doesnt get much better in the documentary division of PBS. A recent documentary (first aired nationally last week) shown by PBS bears the risible title American Umpirean obvious World Series season play on what the filmmakers see as the preposterous notion of an American empire. It is narrated by ex-Marine and former NewsHour host and producer Jim Lehrer. Developed by the right-wing Hoover Institution and targeted for PBS (the organizations own revealing phrase), American Umpire takes the doctrinal American exceptionalist, U.S.-good-and-civilized-rest-of-world-dangerous-and-bad narrative to absurd lengths. It provides extensive expert commentary from such former imperial operatives as Madeline Albright (the onetime U.S. secretary of state who led the charge to criminally bomb Serbia and who went on CBS 60 Minutes to say that the death of more than half a million Iraqi children killed by Washington-led economic sanctions was a price worth paying for the advance of U.S. foreign policy goals), Condoleezza Rice (George W. Bushs neoconservative national security adviser before and during the arch-criminal U.S. invasion of Iraq), Gen. Jim Mad Dog Mattis (an Iraq invasion commander and a former chief of the U.S. Central Command, who two years ago told a San Diego audience that its fun to shoot people), George Schultz (the Reagan-era secretary of state who called the Sandinista government in Nicaragua a cancer in our own land mass that must be cut out) and Karl Eikenberry (a retired Army lieutenant general who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan 10 years ago). With further commentary from a handful of mostly conservative academiciansabove all the nationalist Texas A&M historian Elizabeth Cobbs ( author of a book on which the documentary is based), American Umpire portrays 20th and 21st century U.S. foreign policy as nothing more than a noble effort to selflessly provide welcome and fair rules and discipline on the rest of a childish, dangerous and reckless planet (think Lord of the Flies) that lacks the exceptional historical experience bequeathed to U.S. leaders by the nations far-seeing Founding Fathers. The only substantive criticism of U.S. foreign policy in American Umpire is the complaint, voiced by numerous interview subjects, that America harms itself to the benefit of others (the Europeans above all) by taking upon its shoulders too much of the burden of benevolently policing the planet. We are just too good for our own good. Our Real Task There is not space here to discuss in responsible detail the epic historical deletions and distortions this narrative imposes. The omissions are staggering. They range from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos resisting U.S. imperial invasion and occupation at the last centurys outset to the restoration of de facto slavery in Haiti and the Dominican Republic after World War I; the unnecessary atom bombing of Hiroshima and, even worse, of Nagasaki (really the first shots of the Cold War ); the toppling of more than 50 governments by U.S. coups and invasions since the end of World War II; the liquidation of perhaps as many as 5 million Southeast Asians in the so-called Vietnam War between 1962 and 1975; the Cold War-era sponsorship of Third World fascism from Chile to South Africa and Indonesia; the attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro and numerous CIA-directed terror bombings in socialist Cuba; the near instigation of global thermonuclear war on at least three occasions; the development and sponsorship of Osama bin Laden and other radically arch-reactionary, jihadist Muslim, paramilitary forces to fight the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; the Highway of Death, when U.S. warplanes engaged in an aerial traffic jam as they rushed to slaughter tens of thousands of surrendered Iraqi troops retreating from Iraq in 1991; the coordination and sponsorship of a mass-murderous civil war on peasants, workers and intellectuals (with a death toll well into the many hundreds of thousands) in Central America during the 1970s and 1980s; the disastrous U.S. invasion of Iraq (responsible for at least 1 million Iraqi deaths); the calamitous U.S. toppling of the Libyan Gadhafi regime; the calamitous destabilization of the Syrian regime; the U.S. funding and encouragement of civil war in central Africa; the enablement and protection of a vicious right-wing coup in Honduras in the spring and summer of 2009; the criminal U.S. global war of terror, replete with rampant targeted assassinations, torture, illegal renditions, endless drone war and special-forces killing operations across the Muslim world and other places as well. American Umpire hides these horrific transgressions and the imperial calculations behind much of U.S. foreign policy past and present. As numerous key U.S. planning documents reveal over and over, the goal of that policy was to maintain and, if necessary, install governments that favor[ed] private investment of domestic and foreign capital, production for export, and the right to bring profits out of the country. Given the United States remarkable possession of half the worlds capital after World War II, Washington elites had no doubt that U.S. investors and corporations would profit the most. Internally, the basic, selfish, national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed. As the liberal and dovish imperialist, top State Department planner and key Cold War architect George F. Kennan explained in Policy Planning Study 23, a critical 1948 document: We have about 50% of the worlds wealth, but only 6.3% of its population.   In this situation, we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment. Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity.   To do so, we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and day-dreaming. ... The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans, the better. The necessity of dispensing with human rights and other sentimental and unreal objectives was especially pressing in the global south. Washington assigned the vast periphery of the world economic (capitalist) systemAfrica, Latin America, Southeast Asia and the energy-rich and thus strategically hypersignificant Middle Easta less than flattering role. It was to fulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market ( actual State Department language ) for the great industrial (capitalist) nations (excluding socialist Russia and its satellites). It was to be exploited both for the benefit of U.S. corporations/investors and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous U.S. trading and investment partners organized on properly capitalist principles that were hostile to the Soviet bloc. Democracy was fine as a slogan and benevolent, idealistic-sounding mission statement when it came to marketing this core, underlying, ultra-imperialist U.S. policy at home and abroad. Because most people in the Third World had no interest in neocolonial subordination and subscribed to what U.S. intelligence officials considered the heretical idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people (what post-World War II U.S. planners called communism), Washingtons real-life commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified, to say the least. Democracy was suitable to the U.S. as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of U.S. investors/corporations and related U.S. geopolitical objectives. It had to be abandoned, undermined and/or crushed when it threatened those investors/corporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree. As President Richard Nixons coldblooded National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger explained in June 1970, three years before the U.S. sponsored a fascist coup that overthrew Chiles democratically elected leftist President Salvador Allende, I dont see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people. The selfish imperial cynicism of U.S. foreign policy continues to this day, into the post-Cold War and post-9/11 era. As leading Dutch political scientists Bastiaann van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff write in their important new volume , American Grand Strategy and Corporate Elite Networks: The Open Door Since the End of the Cold War, From the end of the 19th nineteenth century onward, American grand strategy has pursued a liberal expansionism aimed at the creation of a global hegemony premised upon open, free markets, to which global capitaland, above all, U.S. transnational capitalhas full access.   The global Open Door has continued to define the ends of the American grand strategy throughout the post-Cold War era. Becauseas during and beforethe Cold Wars end, Washingtons commitment to democracy and human rights is conditional and hypocritical: The noble principles are fine insofar as they serve the free-market hegemony of global and especially U.S. transnational capital. They are dispensed with, even as U.S. policymakers trumpet them, when they do not.
Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => Dear Mexican:  Por que no hay un pinche l der entre nosotros o de nosotros los mexicanos? Para que tuviera los tanates bien puestos y hablara frente al congreso y les dijera sus verdades a los hip critas pol ticos. Ser que nuestros lideres son unos miedosos o vendidos? No hay uno solo (solo el Chapul n Colorado) que nos defienda, tanta humillaci n que han tenido los negros, siempre de sirvientes o mozos, pandilleros y drogadictos (en Hollywood) y nadie protesta y salen con que Mem n Penguin es ofensivo, otra de esas y nos subimos el cierre, eh? En serio , Ask a Mexican , Como podr a yo hablar delante del congreso, local, estatal o federal? Ser a mucho pedir? P nganse las Pilas, Putos Dear Readers: For those of you who still dont habla and if you dont habla ,  que chingado estas esperando ? the writer asked wheres the Mexican leader wholl take us into the Promised Land of American acceptance, then couldnt help but to attack blacks while he had my attention. Ya cllate con los pinche negros, pendejo . And Mexicans did have a messiah who saved us allhis name was Juan Gabriel, and he recently died. Are there any states in which Mexicans are not yet a majority? Gabacho Really Wants to Know Dear Gabacho: Bruh, the Reconquista aint that advancedyet. New Mexico has the highest percentage of Latinos at 47 percent of its total population, but most of them dont even consider themselves Mexican. The next-highest states are California and Texas, with 38.2 percent of their respective populations Latino per the U.S. Census, although Texas has the higher percentage of Mexicans in that group because of all the South Americans and Central Americans in California. And the state with the lowest Latino percentage of its people? West Virgina, at 1.3 percent. Raza : dont be scared, and move to the Mountain State. Dont forget that hillbillies are just brothers from a different madre . Forgive me for not using neat-sounding Spanish words in this email; my Spanish is rusty, and its late. While I plan to learn it again, Im getting ahead of myself. Reading through the archives of your column, it seems that you have forgotten, or chosen to ignore, those gabachos who actually do not hate the Mexicans. Take me for example. While this email is relatively devoid of Spanish phrases, I love the Spanish language. I studied it in high school, and wholly intend to learn it again, probably next semester. I love Mexican food, and I mean the real stuff (although I do enjoy Taco Bell as well). My high school was relatively small, and we had a lady come in to tutor the few of us who cared to learn Spanish. While she had lived here quite awhile, she had not assimilated into America . She cooked for us one day, and that started my love for authentic Mexican food. She also instilled in me a fascination for Mexican culture. I even would go so far as to say that I would support an amnesty program: Mexicans will always be here, so why not make them legal? If theyre not gonna do it the legal way, then we might as well throw in the towel. I wrote all this to simply remind you that not all Americans hate Mexicans: quite the contrary. Some of us love them! Too Tired to Think Up an Interesting Pen Name, or Any Interesting Questions Dear Gabachos: While I appreciate you and other gabachos who stand by Mexicans, be careful with your words: Trump just might deport you to if he wins.

Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => Dear Mexican: I found your column about Mexican men and spousal abuse, and my question is: Is there any help for this ever ending? Ive been with a Mexican man, who is also an abuser of alcohol, although it has slimmed down some. He gets angry out of the blue and starts hitting on me and later realizes what he has done and cries. I had to leave him for my protection, but the feelings between us remain, and I dont know what to do with the situation. Can you provide any comments or help? Abusada Dear Abused: Get out of that relationshipnow. But before you leave, coat that pendejo s toilet paper with habanero powder, so he gets the burn in the culo he deserves. How do Mexicans feel about environmental issues? Specifically, a population explosion that will cause eventual food shortages? I am told that procreation is a very macho thing for the Mexican male. You have even mentioned in the past that men do not perform oral sex on women because its not important when having children. How does that way of thinking weigh in with regard to the future of the planet? El Blanco Pedro Dear Pedro Gabacho:Malthus calledhe wants his crackpot theory back. Besides, the gabacho love of suburbia proved far more toxic to the environment than any 12-child Mexican mom ever did, so vete a la chingada con your faux environmental concern. OPEN LETTER TO OUR NEW PRESIDENT: Gentle cabrones: as I write this, the Mexican still doesnt have a feel for whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump (or neither?) will be the next president of the United States (The Mexican has to file his columna a week before actual publication viva dead-tree journalism). In the interest of not looking more pendejo than usual, I will write three open letters to ensure I get the results right. Enjoy! TO PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON: Congrats on beating that pendejo Trumpyoure now the greatest female savior of Mexicans since the original Santa Sabina, the legendary curandera for which the goth-Mex band was named. But thats not enough. Do not inherit the title of Deporter-in-Chief from Obama. Realize that the only reason you won is because raza overwhelmingly voted for youand we want results besides appointments of token vendidos (although do give a cool gig to Congressman Xavier Becerra, a truly down Chicano). Dont pay attention to all the Know Nothings who insist on enforcement before amnesty. Theres millions of Mexicans who have lived their entire lives in limbo, and its your job to save them. And if you do that? Well create a new altar to you at Tepeyac. TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Congrats on beating that pendeja Killaryyoure now the greatest unifier of Mexicans since Porfirio Diaz. Dont even try to deport 12 million people, or build that nasty, small-handed wall. Back in the day, raza mostly stood meekly as everyone from Presidents Hoover to Roosevelt to Eisenhower to Obama enacted mass deportationsbut those were honorable men. Youre not. We will protest, we will resist, we will struggle, we will take over elected offices the way Irish took over Boston. You hear me, President Pendejo ? We aint no sleeping giantwe woke, and were ready to make your one-term more pitiful than Enrique Pea Nieto. Oh, and #fucktrump. TO NO RESULTS YET : No mames, America.

Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => Even before Donald Trumps election victory it was becoming clear that we are living in an age of disintegration. Nation states are returning to relationships based on rivalry and friction when the trend was meant to be in the opposite direction. The internal unity of country after country is under stress or has already broken down. Governments and universities used to set up institutions to study greater integration and cooperation, while in fact they might have been better looking at how things fall apart. The phenomenon is most obvious in the wider Middle East where there are at least seven wars and three insurgencies raging in the swathe of countries between Pakistan and Nigeria. But in Europe and the US, foreign and domestic antagonisms are also becoming deeper and more venomous. In this more rancorous political landscape, the election of Donald Trump as US President feels like part of a trend, toxic and dangerous but wide-ranging and unstoppable. Distinct though the political and economic situation in the US, Europe and the Middle East may be in many respects, there is the same dissatisfaction or rejection of the status quo without much idea of what should be put in its place. Political shocks like the election of Trump can produce apocalyptic forebodings that in retrospect turn out to be misplaced or exaggerated. But, in this case, grim expectations about the future may be all too justified and unlikely to evaporate. Trumps promises of radical change may be phoney or opportunistic, but they have a momentum of their own which will be uncontrollable. For all his demagoguery, there was a sense that Trump was often nearer to the issues that concerned voters than Hillary Clinton. In the final election rallies of Trump in Michigan and Clinton in North Carolina, he was promising voters the return of factories and well-paid jobs while she was repeating kindergarten waffle such as love trumps hate and build bridges not walls. He will find it difficult to retreat from these pledges and this is bound to bring confrontation with other trading nations. Overall, the high days of liberal capitalism since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, which continued despite a battering from the financial crisis of 2008, are finally finished. It is an age not just of disintegration but of extremes, with proponents of the status quo either weakened or discredited, as shown by the Brexit vote in Britain. The beneficiaries are mostly on the right: from the 1980s on, the mainstream left in Britain, France and Germany abandoned socialism for liberal free market capitalism as the proven recipe for human happiness, which meant that after 2008 they had no alternative system to advocate and could no longer provide a credible vehicle for protest. The political beneficiaries of disillusionment with things as they are have almost invariably been on the right as with Trump who, along with other rightist insurgencies, can plug into resurgent loyalty to the nation state in the wake of discredited globalisation. There are similarities  so long as the analogies are not overstrained  between the forces behind the Arab Spring protests of 2011, the Brexit vote and Trumps electoral victory today. In all cases, the ruling establishment was weaker and more unpopular than even the most critical observers had imagined: the triumphant protesters were astonished by the extent of their own success. More ominously, it swiftly emerged in the Middle East that the proponents of change had little idea what it should be and had relied wholly on demonisation of their opponents as the source of all evils. There is another parallel between what happened in the Arab world five years ago and events in the UK and the US this year. The old regimes were battered or discarded but there was nothing to replace them with. There is no consensus on what to do. Travelling to Britain from the Middle East, it is striking how the political, social and geographical divisions expressed by the Brexit vote have only deepened with time, whatever pretences there are to the contrary. Political commentators in the UK and US who endlessly proclaimed that, whatever the rhetoric, elections were won by those who seized the centre ground turned out to be wrong because there was not much centre ground to seize. These are not the only political shibboleths which should be discarded. Shocks like these usually provoke jeremiads from the commentariat about how all is chaos and the centre cannot hold. Such dire warnings are swiftly followed by more hopeful commentary about how things have not changed as radically or dangerously as first feared. But, unfortunately, in the case of the US election, the first gloom-filled predictions may be the most accurate. It is true that Trumps authority will be thwarted by the division of powers laid down by the US constitution  though this is somewhat contradicted by Republican control of both Houses of Congress as well as the presidency. Presidential powers are also diluted by those of other state institutions such as the Pentagon and the Treasury. But these comforting thoughts are probably wishful thinking. The extent of the rejection of the American establishment  Democrats, Republicans, celebrities, media  by US voters underlines its weakness. The US media in particular is so much part of the political class that it had become an echo chamber in which it heard only its own views. Leaving aside these dangerous historical trends, there is another more immediate menace stemming from election of Trump in the US and the Brexit vote in Britain: it empowers and legitimises the crackpots and the cranks, those who want to roll back the verdict of past elections since the New Deal if not the Civil War. Those around Trump are not just the Team B of American politics but the Team C or even lower down the alphabet. They may not want to blow up the world but, out of sheer idiocy, they could do just that. I am writing this in the Iraqi Kurdish capital Irbil which is 60 miles from Mosul, where rival armies are fighting their way into Isiss last great stronghold. Nobody expects this to be the end of the wars in Iraq and Syria or the multiple crises tearing the region apart. The experience is evidence of the fragility of states and how easily they can be capsized, not just by domestic divisions and foreign enemies but by avoidable political errors. With Donald Trump soon to be in the White House, it is difficult to avoid the feeling that the world has just become a lot more dangerous place.

Here's something interesting from The Unz Review... Recipient Name Recipient Email => Without resorting too much to the wisdom of the ancient Greek myths, we have come to believe that states, regimes, movements and people finally will emerge to act as the inescapable agents of the justice leading to the downfall of the Western empire Nemesis, Winged balancer of life, dark-faced goddess, daughter of Justice Seven is a winning throw of the dice. But in our civil society, seven now signifies the multi-thong scourge, the whip used by the Western world as its instrument of punishment and, in response; seven signifies Nemesis and her sisters, the inescapable agents of the Wests downfall. The seven scourges of the Western world are used against the people of Asia, Africa, Latin and North America. These whips are constructed, wielded and unleashed especially by the US and the UK. The seven sisters of Nemesis, the Erinyes, are the Furies who pursue the injustices committed by the Western world against Asia, Latin America, Africa and Europe. Those holding the scourge detest and fear Nemesis and the Furies, but are incapable of destroying them. Try as they might, their whip is in corrupt and feeble hands and, of course, it can only follow their orders: Otherwise, it just twitches and remains immobile, while Nemesis pursues the scourgers of humanity. The Seven-Tailed Scourge of the Western World The whip wielded by the Western world, is used to punish disobedient, rebellious people, movements and states. Their multiple lashes have bloodied countless generations and buried millions. The seven scourges against humanity are unrepentant in their promotion of Western values  visible to the terrified world on the red raw backs of oppressed people, their wounds flayed open by the faceless drones proclaiming their gifts of   freedom and democracy. Let us go forward now and describe the pillars holding up the Western empire, the seven-tailed scourge of humanity. 1. Mexico: The Cartel, the Narco-State, US Bankers and Death Squads Over the last two decades, over a quarter million Mexicans have been murdered by the joint forces of the drug cartels, the Mexican State and its death squads, presided over by the US state and backed by its rapacious financial sector. Cartels and complicit Mexican officials prosper because US banks launder their narco-dollars by the billions. On their part, US corporations grow even richer by relocating their plants to Mexico where terrorized workers can be exploited for 1/5 the cost. Amidst the terror and exploitation, over 11 million Mexican workers and family members have fled to the US running from their local scourges, only to confront the US scourge of deportation. Over 2 million have been imprisoned and expelled under Obama. 2. Honduras and Guatemala: Imperial Wars, Drug Gangs and Narco-Oligarchs Destitution and state terror are direct products of US-installed regimes in Honduras and Guatemala. Guatemalas indigenous majority was ravaged by US and Israeli-trained military battalions and death squads. In their wake, scores of narco-gangs, sponsored by local oligarchs and their own private death squads, have emerged. The Honduran people attempted to elect an enlightened liberal President, and were rewarded for their peaceful democratic election with a military coup orchestrated by the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. They further underscore the lesson of Western values: Scores of human rights activists and peasant leaders have been murdered and the scourges continue unabated. 3. Colombia: Nobel Prize for Death Squad President For the past fifteen years, (2001-2016), the Clinton-Bush-Obama regimes launched the seven-billion-dollar Plan Colombia terror campaign against the Colombian people. This scourge was so powerful that over two and a half million peasants, Indians and Afro-Colombians have been driven from their homes and villages while, tens of thousands of peasants, trade unionists, human rights activists and civic leaders have been killed. The notorious narco-President Alvaro Uribe and his Vice President Santos worked with the death squads and the Colombian military under the instruction of over one thousand US military advisers and contract mercenaries as they imposed a scorched earth policy  to consolidate a reign of Western values. In Colombia, the three-tailed scourge of narco-presidents, death squads and the military decimated rural communities throughout that large and populous nation. They finally induced the FARC guerrillas to submit to a peace agreement, which perpetuated the oligarchy. The US remains free to exploit Colombia for its military bases against the rest of Latin America, while foreign corporations exploit its mineral riches. For his part in promoting the peace of the dead, Colombian President Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize. 4. Saudi Arabia: A Household Name Among the Middle East Scourges No country in the Middle East has financed, organized and directed terrorism in the Middle East, South Asia, North and East Africa, the former Soviet Union and even North America, than the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It currently scourges the tiny nation of Yemen. Using its ISIS mercenaries, backed by jets, missiles, and logistical support from the UK and the USA, the Saudi despots has invaded maimed and murdered tens of thousands of Yemenis, while hundreds of thousands face starvation in a Saudi-imposed blockade. The Saudi billionaire regime bankrolled thousands of terrorists in Syria andIraq, giving billions of dollars of business to US and UK arms manufacturers. Saudi monarchs and their extended clans form a parasitic rentier regime unique in the world: They rely on the skills and labor of imported professionals, workers, household servants, mercenary solders, financial managers and even their praetorian guards. They confine their women behind the veil and closed doors, under the absolute rule of male relatives. They chop off the hands, feet and heads of foreign workers and their own citizens for minor offenses, including blasphemy, criticism of the king or resisting an employers abuse. Saudi Arabia, which is totally dependent on Washingtons protection, has become a scourge especially against Muslim people throughout the Middle East and beyond. ORDER IT NOW 5. Israel: The Scourge of Palestine and Free People Near and Far The Israeli State is the head commanding the tentacles of a far-reaching Zionist Power Configuration operating in the US, Canada, England, France and, to a less degree, in satellite states and institutions. Israel was established on the dispossession and ethnic cleansing of millions of Palestinians from their homes and villages since 1948. For almost 50 years, 600,000 Israeli Jews (immigrants given automatic citizenship and stolen property based solely on their ethno-religious identity) have illegally moved into what remained of historical Palestine, building exclusive Jews-only colonial towns on land ripped from its original inhabitants. The Palestinians are herded into apartheid militarized enclaves and squalid camps. Israel invaded and devastated large parts of Lebanon, Egypt and Syria. They have bombed other nations, like Jordan and Iraq, with impunity. The Israeli state uses a virtual fifth column of loyalist organizations and billionaire financiers in the US and EU who ultimately dictate Middle East policy to the elected Western politicians. Presidents and Prime Ministers, Cabinet members and legislators must publicly bow to the increasing demands of the overseas Zionist power structure. This has undermined the will and interests of national electorates and democratic procedures. . All public discourse on this vital issue has been censored because critics of Israels influence are subjected to unremitting campaigns of overt coercion, threats, jailing on trumped up charges, vilification and job loss  within their own countries in the democratic West. Meanwhile, Israel has sold its much-vaunted expertise in surveillance, torture and counter-insurgency to its fellow scourgers in Guatemala, Colombia, Mexico and even Afghanistan. 6. Egypt: Modern Scourges of an Ancient People For decades, Egyptian military dictators have served the Anglo-American Empire and Israels ruling colonists in the Middle East, North and East Africa. Generals-turned-Presidents Hosni Mubarak and Abdel Fattah al-Sisi specialized in murdering, torturing and jailing thousands of Egyptian trade unionists, dissident activists, peasant leaders and the restless urban poor. These violently installed Egyptian rulers are expected to collaborate with Israel and trap millions of desperate Palestinians in the worlds largest open air prison  Gaza. Cairo actively collaborates with the US and Israel in subverting the people and institutions of Gaza, Libya, Somalia and Sudan  guaranteeing that none will be functioning, independent modern states. Egypts first and only elected president Mohamed Morsi was overthrown by General Sisi and sentenced to twenty years in a military torture dungeon (a virtual death sentence for a 65 year old) by a kangaroo court under the direction of Washington and Tel Aviv. Egypt, once the epicenter for civil democratic expression  the Arab Spring  has become the a major staging area for US-backed jihadi terrorists entering Syria. 7. ISIS, NUSRA Front, Ukraine and Syria: Puppets, Kleptocrats, Fascists and Terrorists In this very modern Western world, where democratic values are sold to the cheapest buyer, the US, the UK and the EU shop for mercenaries and puppet regimes in order to scourge their critics and adversaries. The West, led by the Grand Scourger Hillary Clinton, bombed Libya and destroyed its entire modern state apparatus. They opened the floodgates to thousands of mercenaries and terrorist-thugs of all colors and stripes to feed off the carcass of what Gadhafi and the modern Libyan state had built over the past 40 years. These criminals, draped in the banners of humanitarian intervention or mission civilisatice, ran amok, killing and ravaging tens of thousands of Libyan citizens and contract workers of sub-Saharan African origin. The tens of thousands of Africans desperately fleeing each year into the Mediterranean are the result of this Western rampage against the Libyan state. The jihadis have moved on  by those who forgot to distinguish between terrorists who support our democratic values and those who would attack the West. The West cant be blamed: Mercenaries change sides so often. The ethnic cleansing scourges of the past returned to the Ukraine: as (neo) fascists took power in Kiev, storming the Parliament and forcing the President to flee. Nazi-era banners decorated the streets of Kiev under the approving gaze of the US State Department. Neo-Nazi thugs massacred scores of unarmed ethnic Russian citizens in the port city of Odessa when they set fire to the main trade union hall where the trapped men, women and youths were burned alive or bludgeoned while fleeing the flames. The US State Department had spent a $5 billion dollars to replace an elected government with a pliant regime in Kiev while large parts of the country fell into civil war. The ethnic Russian populations of the industrialized Donbas region resisted and were invaded by an ethnically cleansed and neo-fascist putschist Ukrainian army  under US-EU supervision. The war has cost tens of thousands of lives, a million refugees fled to Russia and a divided failing state now festers in the heart of Europe. Kleptocrats and Fascists in Kiev oversee an utterly bankrupt economy. The destitute citizens abandon the towns and cities; some fleeing to Poland to pick potatoes as their serf ancestors did a century ago  ORDER IT NOW Syria has been ravaged by an immense army of mercenary scourges, financed and supplied by the US, EU, Turkey and, of course, Saudi Arabia. Al Qaeda had merely to change its battle flags to NUSRA and receive the US benediction as moderate pro-Western democrats resisting a Baathist Dictatorship in Damascus. In the course of their democratic mission they destroyed the ancient, critical cultural and economic center of Aleppo  scourging the Christians and non-jihadi Muslims and other ancient minorities. Over two million Syrians have died or fled the fiery scourge of Anglo-American and Saudi-Turkish terror. The Seven Sisters: Nemesis and the Furies Confront the Western World The scourges are falling on hard times: East and West, North and South they face their inescapable Nemesis. Their exposed injustices, crimes and grotesque failures herald their inevitable downfall. The seven furies are even emerging in unusual places: 1. The economic and trade power of China challenges the West throughout world, expanding even into the heartland of the empire. The Wests fear over Chinas peaceful economic expansion has led Western political leaders to revive protectionist policies, claiming that barriers against Chinese investors must be raised to prevent takeovers by Beijing. From July 2015 to September 2016, the West blocked nearly $40 billion in productive Chinese investment. This comes after decades of preaching the virtues of foreign investment and the universal benefits of globalization. Suddenly Western leaders claim that Chinese investment is a threat to national security and profits Chinese businesses over Western-owned enterprises  Meanwhile, far from this Sino-phobic hysteria, the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America actively seek greater economic ties with China, to the detriment of US-EU multinationals. Once servile Asian countries, like the Philippines, have declared unfettered US access to frontline imperial military bases in doubt, as they sign favorable multi-billion trade and investment agreements with China. Western imperial ideology about investment and globalization has boomeranged and met its Nemesis. 2. The Russian Furies: Vladimir Putin During the 1990s, the US plundered Russia at will. Washington imposed a unipolar world, celebrated as the New World Order. They bombed and devastated former Russian allies like Yugoslavia and Iraq, setting up ethnically cleansed rump states like Kosovo for their huge military bases. Meanwhile, Washington reduced Russia, under the inebriate Yeltsin regime, to a backwater vassal stripped of its resources, its institutions, scientists, and research centers. In the absence of war, the Russian economy declined by 50% and life expectancy fell below that of Bangladesh. The US celebrated this victory of democracy over a helpless, deteriorating state by welcoming the most obscene new gangster oligarchs and pillagers and laundering their bloodstained loot. The door slammed shut on the pillage with the election of Vladimir Putin and the demise of the Yeltsin gangster-government. Russia was transformed: Putin reversed Russias demise: The economy recovered, living standards rose abruptly; employment in all sectors increased, and cultural, educational and scientific centers were restored. Vladimir Putin was elected and re-elected by overwhelming majorities of the Russian electorate despite huge sums of Western money going to his opponents. Russia systematically recovered many strategic sectors of the economy illegally seized by Western-backed Israeli-Russian oligarchs. Even more important, Putin restored Russian statecraft and diplomacy  formulating a strategy for an independent, democratic foreign policy and restoring Russias defense capability. The loss of this critical vassal state under its dipsomaniacal Boris Yeltsin shook the US EU-NATO alliance to its very core. In the beginning President Putin did not oppose the US-NATO military invasion of Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. It went along with the economic sanctions imposed on Iran. It even maintained its cooperation despite a US-sponsored attack by the government of Georgia against South Ossetia killing scores of Russian peacekeepers. In the wake of those destabilizing disasters, what finally led the Russian government to reverse its complicity with the West was the horrific US-financed invasion of Syria where Russian jihadis from the Caucasus were playing an important role as mercenaries, threatening to return and undermine the stability of Russia. This was quickly followed by the US-sponsored putsch in Ukraine, fomenting a civil war on Russias frontiers, threatening is vital naval base in Crimea and repressing millions of ethnic Russian  Ukrainian citizens in the industrialized Donbas region. These blatant aggression finally pushed Putin to challenge the expansionist policies of Washington and the EU. Putin backed a plebiscite in Crimea and won when its citizens voted overwhelmingly to re-join and preserve the Russian bases. Putin has backed the rebel defense of the Donbas against a NATO-neo-fascist Kiev invasion. Putin accepted a request for aid from the Syrian government as it battled mercenaries and jihadis to preserve its national integrity. The Russians sent arms, troops and air support for the Syrian Arab Army, rolling back the Western and Saudi armed terrorists. In response to the Washington-EU economic sanctions against Russia over the Crimean plebiscite, Putin signed multi-billion-dollar trade and investment agreements and joint defense pacts with China  mitigating the impact of the sanctions. ORDER IT NOW Wherever Washington seeks to seize and control territory and regimes in Eurasia, it now faces the Putin nemesis. In Russia and overseas, in the Middle East and the Caucuses, in the Persian Gulf and Asia, the US meets stalemates at best, and roll-back at worst. The CIA-stooge Yeltsin and his cronies were evicted from the Kremlin to the indignation of Washington and the EU. Many of the kleptocrats, politicos, thugs and swindlers fled to their new homes in Langley, on Wall Street, in Washington or set up talk-shops at Harvard. Even the gruesome Chechens had their color-coded support center (the CIA-American Committee for Peace in Chechnya) based in Boston. Never in modern history has a country so rapidly transformed from degraded vassalage to a dynamic global power as Russia. Never has the US seen its grand imperial design so successfully challenged in so many places at the same time. The Putin Nemesis has become the inescapable agent of the downfall of the US Empire. 3. The Islamic Republic of Iran became a Muslim-nationalist alternative to the US-Israeli dominated Muslim dictatorships and monarchies in the Middle East. The Iranian Revolutions inspired citizens throughout Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq and Yemen. As a result of its growing influence, Iran was punished by the US and EU with crippling economic sanctions pushed especially by Tel Aviv and its Western agents. Fearful that the Irans example would destabilize its control, the US invaded Lebanon, promoted the Israeli invasion and occupation of Lebanon and has backed the terrorist campaign to dismember Syria. The results have been dismal for Washington: Iran continues to support the powerful Hezbollah, a major political and military power in Lebanon. The Saudis war against Yemen is largely an ethno-religious campaign to destroy Yeminis who favor independence over Saudi-US control and have Irans support. Iraqs Shia resistance forces are leading the attack against the Saudi-funded ISIS terrorists, with Iranian commanders playing a significant role. Hezbollah, Irans ally in Lebanon, drove out the Israeli occupation forces and raised the cost of another invasion by Tel Aviv. Against all the impotent, corrupt Arab puppets in the Middle East, only Iran has supported the Palestinians. It is the only force capable of retaliating against an Israeli sneak attack  which is why it is demonized. Iran is the Nemesis against US plans to conquer and dismember Syria. It has provided arms and volunteers on the battlefield against terrorist mercenaries. Iran effectively negotiated a partial lifting of Western sanctions, overcoming Israeli intransigence and securing billion-dollar trade agreements with Germany, Russia and China. It holds the prospects for productive trade and diplomatic deals in the near future  to the howling consternation of its enemies in Washington, Riyadh, London and Tel Aviv. For all the efforts by the tentacles of Israels fifth column, Iran has survived and emerged as the Nemesis of Anglo-American and Israeli ambitions in the Middle East. 4. Venezuela became the leading proponent for an independent foreign policy in Latin America. For almost twenty years, US tried repeatedly to overthrow the government in Caracas. They failed: By ballot or by bullet, despite slapping economic sanctions on Venezuela, the US suffered humiliating defeats and failed coups and aborted uprisings. Venezuela remains Washingtons principal Nemesis, thwarting its efforts to make free trade pacts and deepen military alliances in Latin America. 5. Upon taking office in June 2016, the Philippines new president Rodrigo Duterte assumed the lead role of Washingtons most colorful Nemesis in Southeast Asia. Under his widely popular presidency, he pivoted to China, promising to sharply reduce joint Philippine-US military exercises in the South China Sea directed against Beijing and, in return, he secured the co-operation of several hundred leading Philippine entrepreneurs in winning an initial $13 billion dollar public-private Chinese investment package for critical infrastructure and trade development.. President Duterte has frequently denounced Washingtons interference in his domestic war on drug traffickers  citing the US hypocrisy in its criticism of his human rights record. He has personally held President Obama responsible for meddling in Philippine affairs. Drawing on the history of the bloody US colonial war against the Philippine people in 1898, he holds the US responsible for inciting ethno-religious conflicts in the southern island of Mindanao  Dutertes home region. President Dutertes declaration of independence from Washington (I am no ones tuta (puppy dog))and his foreign policy priority of pivoting from US military domination to regional economic co-operation with Beijing has turned the Philippines into Washingtons prime Nemesis in Southeast Asia. 6. The resistance of the Yemeni people, mainly ethnic Houthi freedom fighters, against the onslaught of bombing and missile strikes by the Saudi-US-UK air force, has aroused widespread solidarity throughout the Middle East. Despite the ongoing massacre of over 10,000 Yeminis, mostly civilians, the Saudi alliance has failed to impose a puppet regime. US links with the Saudi dictatorship have undermined its claims of humanitarian concerns for the people of Yemen. The embattled Houthi rebels have secured the support of Iran, Iraq and the majority of people in the Persian Gulf countries. As the war continues, the Saudis increasingly rely on military trainers, fighter bombers and logistical experts from the US, UK and NATO to pick the targets and maintain the starvation blockade. Sooner or later the courageous and tenacious resistance of the free people of Yemen against the Saudi overlords will inspire a domestic Saudi uprising against its grotesque and decrepit theocratic-monarchist state. The fall of the Royal House of Saud will bury a major scourge in the Middle East. In a word, the battle for Yemen has become the Nemesis of US-Saudi domination. ORDER IT NOW 7. Everywhere in the Western world the ruling classes and their media outlets fear and loath populists  leaders, movements, electorates  who reject their austerity programs designed to deepen inequalities and further enrich the elite. Throughout the European Union and in North and South America, workers and middle class majorities are on the march to oust the free market regimes and restore the populist welfare state, with its emphasis on social services, living wages and humane working conditions. From the UK to France, Poland to Portugal, China to North America, Mexico to Argentina, the Nemesis and Furies of populist rollbacks threaten to dislodge the scourge held by the bankers, conglomerates and billionaires. Scattered populists may hold diverse ideologies; some may be nationalists, leftists, workers, farmers, petit bourgeois and public employees, indebted students, ecologists or protectionists. All are both united and divided by disparate interests and beliefs. And all are preparing for the inevitable downfall of the empire of the free market and wars. Today the worlds greatest global conflicts have lined up the Imperial West and its frontline scourging allies against the Furies and Nemesis emerging on all continents. These are the inescapable agents of the Empires downfall. The scourges of the West have been free to plunder the wealth of subject peoples and launch wars, which ravage both ancient and modern states and cultures while slaughtering and dispossessing scores of millions. The West derives its lifeblood through its seven-tailed scourge. Western elites rule through a chain of scourging puppet states with their bloody accomplices, from narco-murderers, Islamists terrorists, death squads to ordinary piecework torturers. Without resorting too much to the wisdom of the ancient Greek myths, we have come to believe that states, regimes, movements and people finally will emerge to act as the inescapable agents of the justice leading to the downfall of the Western empire. Modern Nemesis and Furies have a dual existence: While bringing down the old order they seek to create alternatives. The scourgers are by their nature specialists in wanton crimes against humanity. Nemesis and her sisters challenge and oust the latter as they construct their own new centers of wealth and power. China, Russia and Iran have gone beyond the role of Nemesis to the West  they are poised to build a new civilization on its ruins. It remains an open question whether they can avoid becoming the new scourge against the people and nations who have risen in revolt.
Michele Paccione / Shutterstock.com Universally, Trump was depicted as an anti-establishment candidate. Washington and Wall Street hated him, and the media were deployed to vilify him endlessly. If they could not discredit Trump enough, surely they would steal the election from him. Some even suggested Trump would be assassinated. Acting the part, Trump charged repeatedly that the election was rigged, and he was right, of course. During the primaries, Hillary Clinton received debate questions in advance from CNN. More seriously, 30 states used voting machines that could easily be hacked. A leaked tape of Trump making obscene comments about groping women became further proof that the establishment was out to get him. In spite of all this, Trump managed to win by a landslide, so what happened? To steal an American election, one only needs to tamper with votes in two or three critical states, and since Hillary didnt win, we must conclude that she was never the establishments chosen puppet. As Trump claimed, the fix was in, all right, except that it was rigged in his favor, as born out by the fact. While everybody else yelped that Trump would never be allowed to win, I begged to differ. After the Orlando false flag shooting on June 12th, 2016, I wrote: In 2008, Obama was touted as a political outsider who will hose away all of the rot and bloody criminality of the Bush years. He turned out to be a deft move by our ruling class. Though fools still refuse to see it, Obama is a perfect servant of our military banking complex. Now, Trump is being trumpeted as another political outsider. A Trump presidency will temporarily appease restless, lower class whites, while serving as a magnet for liberal anger. This will buy our ruling class time as they continue to wage war abroad while impoverishing Americans back home. Like Obama, Trump wont fulfill any of his election promises, and this, too, will be blamed on bipartisan politics. On September 24th, I doubled down: Mind-fucked, most Americans cant even see that an American presidents only task is to disguise the deep states intentions. Chosen by the deep state to explain away its crimes, our presidents pronouncements are nearly always contradicted by the deep states actions. While the president talks of peace, democracy, racial harmony, prosperity for Main Street and going after banksters, etc., the deep state wages endless war, stages meaningless elections, stokes racial hatred, bankrupts nearly all Americans and enables massive Wall Street crimes, etc. Only the infantile will imagine the president as any kind of savior or, even more hilariously, anti-establishment. Since the deep state wont even tolerate a renegade reporter at, say, the San Jose Mercury News, how can you expect a deep states enemy to land in the White House?! It cannot happen. A presidential candidate will promise to fix all thats wrong with our government, and this stance, this appearance, is actually very useful for the deep state, for it gives Americans hope. Promising everything, Obama delivered nothing. So who do you think is being primed by the deep state to be our next false savior? Who benefits from false flag terrorist attacks blamed on Muslims? Who gains when blacks riot? Why is the Democratic Party propping up a deeply-despised and terminally ill war criminal? More personable Bernie Sanders was nixed by the deep state since it had another jester in mind. The first presidential debate is Monday. Under stress, Hillarys eyes will dart in separate directions. Coughing nonstop for 90 minutes, her highness will hack up a gazillion unsecured emails. Her head will jerk spasmodically, plop onto the floor and, though decapitated, continue to gush platitudes and lies. A Very Impressive Performance, CNBC and CNN will announce. Come November, though, Trump will be installed because his constituency needs to be temporarily pacified. The deep state knows that white people are pissed. The media were out to get Trump, pundits from across the political spectrum kept repeating, but the truth is that the media made Trump. Long before the election, Trump became a household name, thanks to the media. Your average American cant name any other real estate developer, casino owner or even his own senators, but he has known Trump since forever. For more than a decade, Trump was a reality TV star, with two of his children also featured regularly on The Apprentice. Trumps Youre fired and his hair became iconic. Trump appeared on talk shows, had cameo roles in movies and owned the Miss Universe pageant. In 2011, Obama joked that Trump as president would deck out the White House in garish fashion, with his own name huge on the faade. The suave, slick prez roasted Trump again in 2016. Trump has constantly been in the limelight. Its true that during the presidential campaign, Trump received mostly negative press, but this only ramped up support among his core constituency. Joe Sixpacks had long seen the media as not just against everything they cherished, but against them as people, so the more the media attacked Trump, the more popular he became among the white working class. Like politicians, casinos specialize in empty promises. Trump, then, is a master hustler, just like Obama, and with help from the media, this New York billionaire became a darling of the flyover states. Before his sudden transformation, Trump was certainly an insider. He donated $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and Bill and Hillary attended his third wedding. Golf buddies, The Donald and Bill were also friends with one Jeffrey Epstein, owner of the infamous Lolita Express and a sex orgy, sex slave island in the Caribbean. In 2002, New York Magazine published Jeffrey Epstein: International Money of Mystery. This asskissing piece begins, He comes with cash to burn, a fleet of airplanes, and a keen eye for the ladiesto say nothing of a relentless brain that challenges Nobel Prize-winning scientists across the countryand for financial markets around the world. ORDER IT NOW Trump is quoted, Ive known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. Hes a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about itJeffrey enjoys his social life. Bill Clinton shouts out, Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science. I especially appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating HIV/AIDS. Epstein gushes back, If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike Tyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign leaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the worlds greatest politician. Even during a very nasty election campaign, Trump stayed clear of Clintons association with Epstein because he himself had been chummy with the convicted pervert. Trump also never brought up the Clintons drug running in Mena or the many mysterious deaths of those whose existence inconvenienced their hold on power. With eight years in the White House, plus stints as a senator then secretary of state, Clinton is considered the ultimate insider. Though a novice politician, Trump is also an insider, and its a grand joke of the establishment that theyve managed to convince Joe Sixpacks everywhere that Trump will save them. Knowing how angry the working class has become, the deep state could not install Hillary, for that would have been a tiresome rehash of another Clinton presidency. With NAFTA, Bill launched the job offshoring that has wrecked this country, and those most affected by it, working class whites, know damn well whos responsible. The Clinton brand has become anathema to middle America. While Clinton says America is already great, Trump promises to make America great again, but the decline of the US will only accelerate. Our manufacturing base is handicapped because American workers will not put up with Chinese wages, insanely long hours or living in cramped factory dormitories. In a global economy, those who can suck it up best get the jobs. On the foreign front, Americas belligerence will not ease up under a Trump presidency, for without a hyper kinetic military to browbeat and bomb, the world will stop lending us money. The US doesnt just wage wars to fatten the military banking complex, but to prop up the US Dollar and prevent our economy from collapsing. The empire yields tangible benefits for even the lowliest Americans. With his livelihood vaporized, the poor man does not care for LGBT rights, the glass ceiling or climate change. Supplementing his wretched income with frequent treks to the church pantry, if not blood bank, he needs immediate relief. Its a shame hes staking his hopes on an imposter. The deep state ushered in Trump because hes clearly their most useful decoy. As the country hopes in vain, the crooked men behind the curtain will go on with business as usual. Trump is simply an Obama for a different demographic. Nothing will change for the better.  is the author of two books of stories, five of poems, and a novel, Love Like Hate .

Recipient Email => Dear Mexican: Why is it that even though we Latinos have similar backgrounds (Indian-Spanish) across America , there is a lack of unity among us here in the USA ? We could be a powerhouse during election times, and definitely obtain a more friendlier immigration deal. El Peruano Dear Cholo: I usually only answer preguntas about Mexicans, but Ill make an exception here because of Election Day. And it hierve down to this: Who wants to be united? Latinos certainly dont. Nowhere except Cuba is a country of the same political thoughtand look how good its working out for them. Although the Mexicans politics are Marxist of the Grouch variety, Im also of the escuela that we need Latino conservatives, anarchists, vendidos , progressives, libertarians, Zapatistas, sinarquistas (ok, maybe not them)all political thoughts. Such diversity keeps us in balance, teaches us about democracy, and will make us stronger as gabachos continue to align themselves into puritanical camps of caca . Let us squabble awayoh, and #fucktrump. In America , the candidates for president spend millions of dollars in other peoples money for a job that could never pay that money back. Is it the same for Mexican candidates, or does it even matter, since those fucking Mexicans can never get the elections right anyway? Conservative, but #fucktrump Dear Gabacho: For most of the 20th century, Mexican presidents came from the PRI, and their method of picking a new leader was simple: el dedazo . The fingernot flipping the pjaro , but a symbolic pointing of the finger toward someone. Yeah, thats totally corruptbut at least we dont spend billions of dollars like fucking gabachos who can never get their elections right anyway, you know? Oh, and #fucktrump. GET OUT EL VOTO !: Gentle cabrones , the Mexican doesnt endorse candidates not named Alfred E. Neumann (source of the greatest quote EVER: English is a language in which double negatives are a no-no!), but I can tell you who NOT to vote for: Donald Trump, and anyone supporting the pendejo . He represents the greatest threat to raza since NAFTA, an agreement he claims to hate but only says that to gain gabachos votes to toss Mexicans across the Rio Grande with a deportation cannon. Hillary Clinton is nowhere near the perfect candidate, and the Mexican wont be voting for her because shes the beneficiary of the Democratic Party own dedazo systembut even a candidate as terrible as her is un chingo better than Trump. If you vote for her, no hate on my partjust tell her to hold her tacos right. More importantly, vote in your local elections, and RESEARCH. Dont just vote for the people with the paisa namesometimes, our own people are worse to Mexicans than any Trumpbot. And if you cant vote because youre undocumented? Volunteer for those politicos who are striving for amnesty and who oppose walls. May you celebrate Election Day with one giant fiesta instead of tragos amargos . Oh, and #fucktrump.

Subscribe John Pilger did an interview with Assange and is planning to use this material for his next documentary about Wikileaks founder! We are going to report with every major info from this interview in the next few days! Assange once again made an astonishing statement, and he confirmed his statement from a couple of days ago that Wikileaks will release election day bombshell, but also added that they are doing this for a reason! Assange offers several predictions and analyses, most quite revealing. He also hinted that he would expose the whole truth about Hillary on election day! Assange notes the most significant email in an entire load of emails may well be the one in which Hillary (2014) contacts John Podesta. This email states that the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region. Assange notes that the backing is from the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. However, he also gave his view about the election day bombshell with surprising statement: We Are Purposely Holding The Emails Back Until Election Day So They Cannot Have Time To Replace Hillary. Pilger observes,  ISIL or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation, will the election day bombshell contain similar material . Assange did not confirm this but just answered that would be very valuable information that could change everything. The slant of this interview is evident, but that does not make it incorrect.

By  on October 28, 2016 Radio Host and Trump supporter claims 'Jewish mafia' controls US [Editors note: The insanity has hit, Trump mouthpiece and Arch Zionist Alex Jones is on the warpath against the Jewish mob; Israels newspapers are shocked, as you can see below  or are they? Trump, grandson of a brothel owner, son of a slum lord, grew up in Meyer Lanskys mob-run New York and by his 30s became the ingenue/money boy of Jewish mob kingpin Roy Cohn; it was Roy Cohn and the Jewish mob that built Trumps empire and ran interference for him with the Gambinos, John Gotti & company. Now, covering this up seems to be really important, but to whom and why? The article below was published in todays Jerusalem Post. Not a word of it is true, moreover, it is an obvious deflection piece written to save Trumps Nazi supporters backing in face of VTs slam dunk assertions of Trumps Zionist fanaticism. After all, Trump has pushed for war on Iran, for clearing out the West Bank and for a one state solution in Israel with Palestinians going through the chimneys. But why then are Americas Jew haters, the human filth that would gas Americas Jews the big Trump lovers? Some of it comes from the Nazi movement itself, largely begun as a fundraiser by the ADL/JDL/AIPAC/SPLC lobby. You see, no swastikas painted on synagogues, no big corporate donations. On Alex Jones by Brother Nathaniel , a long accused rabid anti-Zionist: THE CONTROVERSY OF ALEX BULLHORN JONES being an alleged Zionist shill has now expanded to his apparent Zionist-Jewish connections on his 1) Personal Staff 2) Website Advertisers 3) Link To Time Warner President, Edgar Bronfman Jr. Jones seeming allegiance to Zionism, which explains why he virtually never targets Zionist Jews or the racist, Zionist rogue state of Israel when engaging in his notorious rants and attacks , may well stem from a Protestant-Zionist belief system, and the widely circulated reports that his wife is a Jew  which makes his two children Jewish under Talmudic law and eligible for the Israeli Law Of Return . With additional information on Jones which this site is now providing, Alex Jones Zionist connections prompting his reticence to expose global Zionism, becomes ever more obvious. Trump has played the hate card from day one, building his base on hatred of blacks/African Americans, Messicans and, of course, he has played the terror card, the yellow hordes card and the elite liberal card as well. That one is aimed at the Jews. Trump, whose empire was built by Roy Cohn and who has been supported and financed by Jewish organized crime and now by Vegas boss Shelly Adelson, who can buy and sell Trump out of his trump change, has always been a front for the Jewish mob. Jewish mobsters, as oft pointed out by Ian Greenhalgh, have surrounded Trump and embarrassed him, if you can imagine that, more than once. Years ago, during nasty litigation, radio host Jeff Rense, former partner of Alex Jones, tracked Jones and his backing to the Jewish mob and the Bronfman crime family, accused of their complicity in financing 9/11. Now we see the Zionist press pulling out the anti-Semite card on Alex Jones, one of Israels strongest supporters in the US. Is this a joke? Of course, this kind of childishness would only work with the brain dead Jew hating Nazis that have flocked to Trump. With Trumps effusive love of everything Israel and everything Zionist, one might ask why the Nazis flock to him, but Nazis have never been thinkers and are great followers, even when they are sent over a cliff like lemmings. Comment boards at VT have been inundated with paid trolls, some who track back to Israel, others employed by Trump surrogate operations tied to his campaign. Toads and trolls get up to $50 for a comment placed even on wrong articles. Thus, we have closed comments to cut off this income source and clean out the trash were we can even though this is the best money Trump pays out except for hookers. When are American Jews going to rise off their knees and hit back at, well, at Israel, the ADL and the rising tide of Naziism in the US paid for by their donations? If the read below doesnt have you laughing, we are sorry. Humor is where we find it and this is humor at its best. G]
Waking Times Does anyone even know why we eat turkey every Thanksgiving? Does anyone even know why we have Thanksgiving? Is it just to eat turkey? ~ Erin Janus Another Thanksgiving holiday is upon us, and the tradition of coming together with family to celebrate a vague connection to our heritage as conquerors of North America will be celebrated by millions of people. This year, however, Thanksgiving is all the more ironic given the circumstances unfolding at the Standing Rock Indian Revolution over the Dakota Access Pipeline where Native Americans are being brutalized by militarized police who are protecting a corporate project. So what is the true story of Thanksgiving? A brief history lesson: The first actual proclaimed Day of Thanksgiving came in 1637 in a meeting between the Pequot Indians and English religious mercenaries. The Pequot were celebrating their annual Green Harvest Festival, which resembles modern-day Thanksgiving. On the eve of the festival, the English demanded that everyone comes out of their homes, puts their weapons on the ground, and surrenders by converting to Christianity. Those who obliged with these terroristic demands were either shot dead or clubbed to death. Those who stayed inside their longhouses  including women and children  were burnt to death. In all, more than 700 Pequot men, women, and children were slaughtered that day. The victory was celebrated by the Governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony holding a feast and trumpeted this as a Day of Thanksgiving. During the celebration, they cut off heads of Natives and put them on display publicly; including beheading the Wampanoag Chief and impaling his head on a pole in Plymouth which stayed on display for the next 24 years. ~ Irwin Ozborne Beyond the historical context of Turkey Day, there is a modern aspect of this story that needs to be outed and understood. Modern meat farming has become the most horrifying and inhumane practice on planet earth. While some activists work to expose the shocking abuses that routinely take place in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), the meat industry and the National Grocers Association is constantly working to avoid the public relations nightmare that publicity would certainly bring. Ag-gag laws criminalize activism with the aim of keeping consumers in the dark, and the largest meat companies have engineered a top-down system of farm control where individual farmers are under severe contracts, having no say whatsoever on how animals are housed and treated. Never the less, the issue of animal cruelty as an embedded part of our food supply is something which needs to be brought into the light of day and exposed, for there truly are much more healthier and humane ways of feeding ourselves. To this end, and to bring awareness to the ritual insanity of Thanksgiving turkey dinners, filmmaker and activist Erin Janus presents Turkey Day, a short film about the weeks festivities. A word of warning, though, for some of the content in this video, while 100% real, is genuinely disturbing. People will do things just cause everyone else does, and just keep doing it until it becomes tradition. ~ Erin Janus Read more articles from Vic Bishop .

Waking Times One of the greatest takeaways of election 2016 is that mainstream, corporate news no longer cares about maintaining the appearance of objectivity, and that the internet has made it possible to counter the top-down state driven narrative with genuine, alternative journalism. This of course challenges the king-making abilities of the corporate media who were shocked when their preferred candidate lost. Hillary Clinton was the choice of nearly every American newspaper editorial board. It didnt matter. ~ The Los Angeles Times Just a week after the election, Google, Facebook, Twitter and other internet giants are now declaring a war on so-called fake news sites , trumpeting the idea that unregulated information is confusing and misleading the public and interfering with our ability to make sound decisions. The sub-text here is that the public can not be trusted, and therefore information in the public domain must be controlled and regulated. But by whom, exactly? Already several lists of websites are being widely circulated around the internet and heralded as go-to places to instantly determine the credibility of an internet publisher. There are a number of alarming problems with this, especially for a nation that supposedly values freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Several of these lists taxonomize websites under multiple categories, which are only tangentially related, yet grouped under the all encompassing banner of fake news. But, what is the difference, for instance, between fake news and misleading news? And, is there a material difference between misleading news and clickbaity news, or is it just about wording of the article title? Also, what is the difference between a fake news site and a hoax site? And, where does editorial news fit into this spectrum, and if the term propaganda is being used, does it now apply to editorializing in general? The most important concern, though, is who decides what fake news is? The Zimdars Hit List The most widely circulated list right now was created and is maintained by Melissa Mish Zimdars , a professor and researcher at Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts. Bio: I am an assistant professor of communication & media, and this list started as a resource for my students, who are learning about journalism/social media/media literacy. ~ Melissa Zimdars The Zimdars list of news site you should avoid is located here . It breaks down some 100+ websites with different ratings under the broad introductory headline,  False, Misleading, Clickbait-y, and/or Satirical News Sources. There are zero examples given for any of these sites explaining why they fall under the heading of fake news, or why their content is to be considered questionable, just a link to their homepage. In other words, these sites are fake news sites because Melissa Zimdars says they are. When I first saw this list, I was actually not surprised to find that my site, www..com , was on this list, given our easy to spot anti-status quo perspectives, although it was intriguing to me that my site was misnamed Walking Times, which I took as a sign of the authors carelessness in creating this list. Waking Times has a five-year history as an internet blog and content publisher, with almost 7000 original, guest authored and aggregated articles which express the personal interests, biases and world views of the editor, myself, Dylan Charles . This is perfectly legal and acceptable in a free society. I contacted Ms. Zimdars and demanded that she remove our site from the list, and although I have not heard back from her personally, to her credit, our site was removed from the list within half an hour of my email. For background on her biases, Ms. Zimdars has publicly responded to the question of what news sites trusts and visits: Some people are asking which news sources I trust, and all I can say is that I read/watch/listen very widely, from mainstream, corporate owned sources ( The New York Times , The Washington Post, The Boston Globe , The Wall Street Journal , Forbes ) as well as The Atlantic, National Public Radio, and various local and alternative sources with different political perspectives, some of which are included on this list. ~Melissa Zimdars Without question, many of these mainstream sites are guilty of publishing false, biased, clickbaity, and propagandistic news, especially so in this election season, so it is clear that an agenda is in play here. The U.S. News Hit List This list, published by U.S. News & World Report by Rachel Dicker , Associate Editor of Social Media, only features 16 websites, out of thousands, defaming other peoples work without proof, citation or even examples. Titled, Avoid These Fake News Sites at All Costs , the Dicker list, which includes the well-known satirical site, The Onion , offers three categories, satire, hoax, and propaganda, all lumped under the banner of fake news. Serious anti-establishment blogs like Activist Post are grouped along satire and hoax as propaganda. Who decides which propaganda is allowable? Rachel Dicker has published a number of articles for U.S. News, which can be seen on her author page, here . A quick scan of her work reveals an overt bias towards liberalism, against Donald Trump, for social justice issues, and towards leftist political causes. In other words, Rachel Dicker herself has a bias and an agenda, and is a propagandist. The Growing List of Other Hit Lists Now that its all the rage to castigate supposedly fake news in frenzy of coming official censorship, the list of lists is growing, and propagandists have now been given franchise to defame others. Ed Brayton has a list, here . Inquisitr has its elaborated list, here . Snopes, the self-proclaimed oracle of internet truth has published its warning, here . The Independent has posted their version of the Zimdars list, here . Pardon the pun, but the list goes on and on. Real Issues  Censorship and Personal Responsibility Whats really happening here is a portal towards total internet censorship is being opened and exploited by the establishment. The internet has in recent years been flooded with bogus news sites, and it has long been my suspicion that this phenomenon would lead to exactly the scenario we see unfolding right now. The public would clamor for a crackdown on so-called fake news, and in the wake, real, truthful, and critical alternative journalists will be forced out of business and off the internet by an authoritarian corporate government. Another real issue at play here, though, is the concept of personal responsibility on the part of both publishers and internet users. There is inarguably some gray area when looking at how the internet will evolve, as there are no doubt players who will publish anything just to make money, but does that mean that individuals shouldnt be trusted with making up their own minds? The following message from activist John Vibes does well to sum up the conflux of these two issues in the following statement: The internet and the alternative media has given us freedom of information. One drawback to this is that people did not seem to get the memo that responsibility is somewhat of a prerequisite for true freedom. In previous eras, the mainstream media spoon-fed people information, and whether it was true or not, everyone accepted it at face value because they didnt have much of an ability to fact check even if they wanted to. Now we have a sea of information thanks to the intern et and the alt-media. Just like the mainstream media in the past, some of this information is factual, while some of it is not. With the mainstream media though, since they only gave you one narrative instead of a sea of information to sift through, it was easy for someone to make up their mind about things. Now with all this freedom of information, people really need to do their due diligence and actually research the information they come across, instead of letting a media organization spoon feed them a particular point of view, this goes for both alternative and mainstream media. I say this in light of the fact that multiple sites that i write for have been targeted as fake news sites because we present a viewpoint that is alternative to the mainstream. We are being lumped in with bullshit clickbait sites and i think that is all a part of the plan that the mainstream has to reassert their legitimacy. We work very hard to fact check our info, and always make corrections when necessary, however, people need to realize they are in a new era of media, one that requires research and personal responsibility. Final Thoughts The changing face of news and information with the advent of the internet and user friendly content management systems means that anyone can share their ideas with people who are willing to look at them. And people naturally have opinions about politics and life, meaning that we are all propagandists when we publish on the internet. As the corporate and political establishment look for more ways to control the debate and control public opinion, we will see the rise of self-appointed truth czars and the rise of an official ministry of truth.

 Eric Zuesse CNN explained well 5 surprising lessons from Trumps astonishing win , and the historic crushing failure of traditional Presidential-year American politics, but it really boils down to one simple fact: In the battleground states, where most of the advertising dollars and get-out-the-vote money was being spent, the Trump organization made use of the Republican-Party organization in those portions of the campaign-operation that benefited from those established contacts and its tried-and-tested methods and techniques, but not in the portions of the campaign-operation that needed to be improved and to function better than in all prior U.S. Presidential elections. The simple fact is that Trumps understanding of U.S. national politics was transcendent, better even than that of the candidate whom all of the polls during the political primaries showed to be the most preferred by the most people and thus to be able to beat any of the other contestants in a one-on-one electoral choice against any of the others: Bernie Sanders. (See this and this for the evidence on that.) (And if there were any remaining doubt as to why he was, consider this report from Reuters near 3AM on Wednesday November 9th, right after the voting: U.S. voters want leader to end advantage of rich and powerful  Reuters/Ipsos poll . For example, this poll of 10,000 people leaving their polling-places showed: 75 percent agree that America needs a strong leader to take the country back from the rich and powerful. That had been Bernie Sanderss message, too. Trumps campaign brought people like that out to vote.) Sanders may have been right to think that highest net approval-rating is generally the biggest single predictive factor determining a Presidential candidates winning the White House (and he had the highest net-approval rating), but he (like his opponent Hillary Clinton) missed the importance of the emotional-intensity factor, which Trump made virtuosic use of . (This can be seen clearly when you look further at the exit-poll results: the actual people who went to the polls  the people sampled in the exit-polling  were fundamentally different from the cross-section of Americas likely voters that were sampled in the pre-election polling! Trump trumped all traditional politics. This achievement is simply astounding.) Whereas Sanders failed to recognize that in Democratic Party primaries there was more emotional intensity for the existing, Clinton-Obama, anti-FDR, Democratic Party, than there was for ideological progressivism (FDRs legacy, which dominated the Democratic Party prior to Bill Clintons win in 1992) (and Hillarys understanding of that turned out to have been correct), and so the incompetent but aristocracy-backed politician Hillary Clinton was able to steal the Democratic Party nomination from him, Trump was able easily to garner the most primary votes in a crowded 17-candidate field and so to become the nominee of one of the two major political Parties and go on to face the incompetent Hillary in the general election. From Bernie Sanderss standpoint, such a general-election contest, between two candidates both of whom had hugely net-negative approval-ratings, couldnt have made much political sense, and so he chose to endorse the thief Hillary and become a non-entity in the post-1992 and profoundly corrupt Democratic Party, instead of to found an authentically independent political movement  not political Party but political movement  which would honestly and without partisanship cherry-pick which candidates, from which of the two political Parties, will, on balance, as against the given candidates opponent, provide the highest benefit and least harm toward advancing the progressive cause. (That was the only constructive path forward for him after Hillary robbed him.) He chose the stick-in-the-mud route. Sanders opted to become just a cog in an ugly greasy pro-aristocracy machine, the Democratic Party wing of the U.S. aristocracy. After the Republican Partys nomination was won by Trump (which he did honestly), he went on to build on that success an authentic anti-aristocracy (or anti-Establishment) movement, beside and outside the Republican Party. His basic anti-aristocracy message remained unchanged, and he, as the Republican nominee, faced the biggest decision-point in his entire campaign: whether now to reach out to the millions of Sanderss voters (i.e., the largest of all voting-segments) by joining with now Hillarys  the post-1992, Bill Clintons, Democratic Partys  emphasis upon both race and gender over economic class as whats posing the biggest barrier to achieving equality of economic opportunity in America (in which case, Trump would have adopted Hillary Clintons basic campaign message), or, instead, to stay with his original message that economic class (and the elites corruption behind that) poses the biggest barrier against achieving the equal-opportunity society. Trump  wisely, as it now turns out  chose the latter path (the original Bernie Sanders basic message): he was determined to retain the intensity-advantage (the populist thrust), so as to be able to bring the largest numbers of voters to the polls on Election Day in the toss-up states and crush his opponent who was looking to win a coalition of voting- segments : women, Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, etcetera. She thought that those peoples personal group-identification would sufficiently surmount any negative feelings they might have regarding her long history of corrupt use of public office to advantage her financial supporters, so that she would beat the bigot, Donald Trump; she turned out to be wrong . What will be the important consequences of Trumps win? I, a Bernie Sanders voter, voted for Trump against Hillary, for the reasons that I have earlier stated, describing the consequences that a Trump win would have. (See: Im a Bernie Sanders Voter: Heres Why Ill Vote Trump  .) I summed up, on that occasion: Trump is rapidly moving Americas political center in the opposite direction from the direction that Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton, did, which was toward conservatism, away from progressivism: those conservative Democratic Presidents and (now) would-be President, have moved Americas political center considerably toward the right ( the international-corporate agenda ). A President Trump would reverse the political direction that this country has been heading in ever since 1993. If we progressives dont help Trump to do that, we shall be throwing away the only such opportunity that the U.S. oligarchy (slipped-up and) allowed us to have. A President Hillary Clinton would have the support of almost all congressional Democrats no matter how right-wing her proposals are, and her big-money financial backers will buy enough congressional Republicans to make her the most effective most conservative Democratic President in decades if not centuries. The prospect is chilling. The biggest objection I hear to that from my fellow progressives is: But think of the people hell appoint to the U.S. Supreme Court! And my answer to that is: This Is No Cold War; Its Far Worse Than That. Hillary Clinton has been intensely committed to completing Barack Obamas drive toward nuclear war against Russia, and even the question of the Supreme Court is trivial in comparison to that. Furthermore, as I argued in Im a Bernie Sanders Voter: Heres Why Ill Vote Trump  , Trump might actually turn out to be a far more progressive President than he is expected to be. But, even if that turns out not to be the case, Trump is thoroughly committed to halting Americas aggression against Russia: the biggest loser in this Presidential election is George Herbert Walker Bush, the person who in 1990 secretly established the U.S. plan to conquer Russia, which plan every U.S. President since has been carrying out , and Hillary Clinton was expecting to complete that operation. This was thus a historic U.S. election: finally, the U.S. government will turn away from the path toward war against Russia, upon which path the United States has been leading the world ever since 1990. I am shocked, and enormously relieved, at the result  even if Trump turns out to be a bad (i.e., a conservative, the opposite of a progressive) President on all other matters (including the Supreme Court). Even in the worst-case scenario, Trump will be a much better President than would the neoconservative , Hillary Clinton. Thank you, Donald Trump! Without your achievement here, the likely result now would be catastrophic, even worse than what Hillary Clinton did as U.S. Secretary of State .
Orangutan. Rigged. Worth trying but its not a fair game. Smartmatic style Diebold type machines and software will count the votes and the corporate controlled media will announce the results. No mention of Election Fraud or the problems of the past. Long live Mike Connell, Clint Curtis, Bev Harris, Brad Friedman, RFK Jr. and other whistleblowers who have tried to fight for our democracy. Will only get worse from here it seems. Always hopeful though. David S Government will win as always. Freedom will lose as always. The ruling elite control most elected officials and hundreds of thousands of government bureaucrats legislate unconstitutionally from their offices. We sit upon $20 Trillion in real debt and another $250+Trillion in unfunded liabilities. Trump wishes to increase military spending and Hillary never met a war she didnt support (on behalf of her puppetmasters of course). Our medical system is nearly completely destroyed by over a century of government micromanagement and collusion with the AMA. We have more people incarcerated than nearly every other country on earth  mostly for non-violent drug offenses  and neither candidate looks to have the courage or the desire to truly allow freedom in this area (though Trump shows the greatest hope). Our government/CIA/other black ops groups, etc. are working tirelessly to undermine governments around the world, incite violence, and provoke armed conflict  maybe even nuclear  all for the benefit of the arms cartel and banksters who profit from every war. The people of America clearly have NO interest in restoring freedom, liberty, private property rights, business rights, sound money, etc. anymore. This rebellion that has gotten behind Trump still needs to bear fruit with regards to demanding REAL change at the federal and state levels. What will come of the following months is to be seen, but I suspect, as with so many previous rebellions, these folks will go back to their televisions, iPads, and Playstations and will forget about the fundamental corruption and crony capitalism that is destroying this country so long as they get a few bones thrown their way to pacify them. Let us hope something far more profound comes of it all. Time for a drink. kimyo fwiw: a screencap of final results displayed on 11/2 (apparently by accident) by nbc station wrcb-tv shows: popular vote: clinton 41,765,317 / trump 40,124,438, electoral college: clinton 343 / trump 195. although the early reporting showing trump with a commanding lead matches my take on american sentiment, my cynical side suspects that it is the msms way of getting out the later-voting clinton supporters if anonymous were a real thing, todays show would be have been completely different. real hackers dont waste their precious time defacing websites. ps: if trump does win, i picture zuesse as the dog, who, after years of chasing, has finally caught that darn UPS truck. growling, jowls full of brown bumper, but with a dawning comprehension on his brow, realizing well, exactly what do i do now? Orangutan. Continuity of Govt plans have been implemented and in place. Dept of Homeland Security is now running our elections. The results will not be publicly available for review anymore according to Bev Harris. Similar to the results in California where the primary was announced for Hillary but Bernie may have actually ended up winning there. Welcome to the 1984 style Continuity of Government plan and Department of Homeland Security run elections thanks to the publics refusal to emotionally or intellectually acknowledge the truth about 9/11 or the false flag anthrax attacks that followed. TruthTime Especially agree with the comment about the Anthrax attack. The criminals are still at large for that blatantly, obvious state-sponsored crime. I laughed when Obamas Administration decided to shut down any investigation into it. America is a Nation of subjects who are continually subjected to the lies and falsehoods of their elected leaders. We have state crimes going far back to the era of JFK. People that still think Corruption isnt really that bad in Washington, that its all a conspiracy theory. Carl Herman Thank you for asking, GW. Its not an election when it fails to meet that definition due to multiple methods for election fraud. Its not for a US president therefore, but an appointed leader. And, its not reported by media, but the appointers propaganda minions. Of course, if we continue this argument with ~100 other points centered in lie-started Wars of Aggression, bankster-looting, and lying about near everything important, we cant even call it the US as defined by our Constitution. So, where do we go from here? Start with truth. Then see what develops. Charlie Primero Carl, this vote shows that all the people you have been trying to wake up to the corruption and graft are waking up. This is just the beginning. Be happy. MyWikiDisQus It does not matter what we think or do or say anymore. The republic has been overthrown by the plutocrats who remain in power as long as the citizenry believe in the concocted and fraudulent electoral system they fabricated that selects the candidate who serves them, not the people. Participation of the masses is necessary to grant them the mandate to ensure the continuity of their reign that has continually impoverished the majority of the nation. In the beginning representative government in America was a wonderful experiment that has since devolved, brick by brick, decade by decade into a shell of its former creation to become a bastion of despotism. The poor are still slaves, indentured to the government by onerous debt as Negros were to their 19 century plantations masters; only the title of ownership has changed. The middle class, once a foundation of prosperity has now become an economic ghost, relegated to the status of freemen of the peasant class. The wealthy are richer in material possession, millionaires become billionaires and the government siphons off from the upper class to enrich itself by political favor, by statute and regulation, by ignoring the rule of equal justice under the law. How long will the people tolerate this abomination of corrupt authority? What will be the future event that triggers the entire country to say, Enough!? Will it be a complete economic breakdown of society or the devastation of nuclear war on our soil? We the People have the power, we have always possessed it. The time of reconciliation is upon us, we must balance the ledger of liberty back in our favor. The only way to peacefully do it is reject the system that oppresses us. Do not engage with them, do not obey them, tell them their lies carry no truth, we see through the veil of falsity and reject it and demand a new path to opportunity and happiness for all who are willing to work towards it. TruthTime The U.S. is fucked. But it needs to collapse now or within 100 years for people to totally realize they were duped. It is the only way to start anew. kimyo according to zh, trump has ohio, florida and north carolina. my top 3 questions: 1) will there be a thorough investigation of the clinton foundation? 2) what will he do if the next 9/11 happens on his watch? 3) will he kill cop21 and defund global warming research? diogenes One thing is utterly clear: if Trump wins, the wholly Wall Street owned Democratic Party gave it to him by rigging primaries to put the Clinton criminal gang on the ballot. Because Bernie would have won  won with the votes not only of millions of nominally Democratic voters who rightly cant stomach Clinton and didnt vote for her (whether we voted Green, or Libertarian or Trump or stayed home)  but also with the votes of millions who are voting Trump because he appears to at least not be part of the Wall Street criminal gang of hereditary oligarchs. Tim Chambers Looks like Trump will be President and free to do as he pleases. The Repugs bet on Scalias seat has been made good. The Democrats will now have to rethink identity politics and third way neoliberalism. I wonder if Obama will try to ram through the trade agreements and a few other monstrosities now during the lame duck session. Bye, Bye, Hillary, bye bye. Its the one silver lining to the overhanging clouds. What a disaster of a candidate! Such arrogant over-confidence. And what a comeuppance for the party and its big money backers! It is going to cost them a lot of money to into Trumps good graces. All we need now is for Trump to sell out his working class supporters for the Democrats to return to a sincere class-based politics that brings back the independent voters. They should have given Bernie his rightful chance. Unfortunately, what we are likely to see is another attempt by the Clintons 4 years from now against Warren. Two losses isnt likely to dissuade that bitch in the least. I told you back in April and again 2 weeks ago that Trump would win!! http://www./2016/10/donald-j-trump-will-win.html Tim Chambers fuggetaboutit Evil Genius Who knows the Clintons and Waltons better than Arkansas? My favorite part was Arkansas voted 2-1 against Clinton. Ha ha ha! (BTW GW: Theres an error in Robert Parrys bio the word broke is missing (i.e., broke stories).) kimyo imagine if tomorrow trump says yes, absolutely, were going to build that wall, but while were waiting for the check from mexico why dont we find 500 out-of-work engineers and architects and 5,000 out-of-work construction folk and send them to flint to fix the water system. (costs him nothing, delivers grand justice) cnn had a bad day today, but theyd be totally fd tomorrow. trump should hire some guy (me!) whose only job is to make cnn miserable, each day worse than the last. ps: arpaio gone is nice. cali cannabis is nice. why is this thread so inactive?

0 Add Comment IN THE immediate aftermath of Donald Trumps shock win in the US presidential election, there were fears many people would become lost in grief, voicing their anger and sadness in all directions in a bid to vent their sense of profound fear and apprehension now that a person who has repeatedly uttered reprehensible beliefs occupies the most powerful position in the world. However, this proved not to be the case as WWN found out when it talked with numerous people in America and around the world, who exemplified the pride the human race now had in itself after being able to greet the horrific news in a calm and measured way. It is when were faced with adversity, when hate shows it now owns the map, that we must forge a new path together to the brighter future we all want, but that future will be after a nuclear winter obviously, a sobbing wreck of a man and a proud American, Philip Henry shared with WWN, as he polished his shotgun and thought about taking a walk alone to his shed out back. The election clearly divided people, but it is time for the people to come together. Love trumps hate. A rising tide lifts all boats, New Yorker Sarah Klein shared as she boarded a small sail boat, unsure of where she was going, I have no idea how to sail but Ill live like Kevin Costner in Waterworld if I have to, she added. Many people echoed the sentiments of Hillary Clintons concession speech in which the Democrat urged everyone to work with Donald Trump and give the man who called Mexicans rapists and murderers and called for a ban on Muslims the benefit of the doubt. Trump Tower doesnt look all that structurally sound, were talking what? A few sticks of dynamite and the whole thing comes down. Just asking for a friend, obviously, shared another New Yorker we spoke to. It is believed the number of people placing their children in pods and launching them into space in the hope they reach a more tranquil planet with a brighter future elsewhere are still in the minority. The rational and reasoned response was also experienced outside of America where, although people acknowledged the fact theyve heard every word uttered from the president elect, they suspect everything will be fine. Sure, what difference does it make, be grand Im sure, shared Dubliner Rebecca Kelly, fresh from pulling out all of her hair in a panic, and disconnecting her TV, radio and internet for at least four years. Never felt better, offered a hooded figure holding a flaming torch in one hand and a rope in the other.
0 Add Comment RATHER than relax and play Texas Hold Em with his friends as they had a few cans after a recent night out, hardcore culchie Noel Kennelan desperatley attempted to explain the impenetrable rules of the card game 25, which he claims is way better than poker, hi. 25, also known as that culchie game, involves the dealing of 5 cards to each player and the reveal of a trump card, followed by at least 10 minutes of explaining how the 2 of spades can beat the 9 of diamonds if spades were lead with, and diamonds arent trump. Kennelan, 28, made great efforts to explain to the 6 other men around the table of his Dublin flat the baffling rules of stealing and reneging, but in the end had to concede that the game was too complex and the players were too drunk to fully wrap their heads around it. After the nightclub, back to the house, few cans, the cards come out, said Kennelan, dealing himself a solemn hand of Patience. The lads all play poker, but 25 is where its at. Way more skill, you can win a hand with nothing if you play it right. But the lads just couldnt get to grips with the fingers. Kennelan later went online to see if there were any culchies in the area who were looking to play 25, and is considering setting up a club or something where they can go and drink Smithwicks and play cards and complain about Dublin.
We Are Change Donald Trump on Saturday was quickly ushered off the stage by Secret Service agents in the middle of a campaign speech in Nevada after an incident in the crowd near the front of the stage. The incident turned out to be a false alarm that spurred the arena into chaos.Early reports suggested a man now known to be Austyn Crites, 33 was potentially armed in the crowd according to some witnesses. Those reports have since been retracted the man was found to unarmed besides with a republicans against Trump sign.

The witness then proceeded to get the attention of four bigger guys surrounding them and confronted the man. The man then freaked out and reached into his pocket to grab what looked like a gun. According to the witness the man was mumbling about the delegates.  I was in the crowd, me and my dad saw a guy creeping toward the stage staring at trump. i got the attention of 4 big guys around me and we confronted him and when we did he spurged out and reached into his pocket to grab what looked like a gun. when we tackled him to the ground and between punches he kept saying something about the delegates? he must have the delegates. sorry im pretty shaken up right now.  With one person in the crowd shouting hes got a gun. The man was then detained by police officers, Secret Service agents and SWAT armed with assault rifles and taken to a side room for questioning. The man is seen below bei Trump returned to the stage minutes later and proceeded to continue his speech before thanking the Secret Service and police. Nobody said it was going to be easy for us, but we will never be stopped. We will never be stopped. I want to thank the Secret Service.

We Are Change In todays political climate even our beer is up for debate. And why shouldnt it be? This is America. We debate things here. Thats how democracy works. (At least when the issues arent taboo.) Recently, its shown up in the state of Pennsylvania with Eric Trump, Donald Trumps son, garnering an endorsement for the Republican candidate from Yuengling, Americas oldest brewery.And now the debate turns to political action.With the most recent statement from Richard Dick Yuengling Jr., the 73-year-old owner of D. G. Yuengling & Sons, located in Pottsville, Pennsylvania  the seat of Schuylkill County  Yuengling said that his company was behind Trump. Inevitably, a lashing out occurred in the digital realm with regard to political correctness and expressively personal views. Customers werent pleased. They were offended. In fact, some even claimed that theyd never drink Yuengling again.This is what democracy is, and should be. Sure. And yet, something is lost in the politicized scramble of this ugly election year.A Pennsylvania state representative, Brian Sims, announced on his Facebook page that he was saying GOOD BYE to Yuengling Brewery.Im not normally one to call for boycotts but I absolutely believe that how we spend our dollars is a reflection of our votes and values! Supporting Yuengling Brewery, that uses my dollars to bolster a man, and an agenda, that wants to punish me for being a member of the LGBT community and punish the black and brown members of my community for not being white, is something Im too smart and too grown up to do. Sims represents the 182nd district of Philadelphia , which includes a majority of Center City, in addition to parts of Rittenhouse Square, Grays Ferry, and South Philadelphia. I live here. I walk those areas of the city.And I see, feel, and hear other elements of our society that go unnoticed or receive little to no attention. To observe this sort of outcry against a presidential candidate is expectantly what democracy was birthed upon, as we know in the city of Philadelphia. We take action. (We like to think.) However, along the way Ive seen the incessant results of many issues that get buried, in favor of political expediency and trending topics that ultimately define our aggressive actions towards voting with our dollars.If thats the case, then what about all the other detriments to our standard of living? For instance, the opiate epidemic that is sweeping Pennsylvania and the surrounding states and the rest of the country by storm.According to a June 2016 report from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health , entitled The Epidemic of Overdoses From Opioids in Philadelphia, drug deaths involving the fatal use of opioids, from 2000-2014, had tripled. In 2014, approximately 47,000 people died from overdoses in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC). Sixty-one percent of that total was attributed to the use of opioids.Since 1999, the number of prescriptions for pharmaceutical opioid pain relievers in the U.S. more than quadrupled. Opioid-related overdose deaths in Philadelphia were nearly three times higher in men than among women in 2015. Those deaths were also more than two times as high among whites, as opposed to deaths among African Americans.Between 2003 and 2015, in Philadelphia, cocaine and benzodiazepines were detected in overdose deaths in tandem with opioids at a rate of 70% and 90%, respectively. During that same period, overdose deaths related to heroin more than doubled in the city, with approximately 400 deaths reported in 2015.In that same year, there were nearly 700 drug overdose deaths in Philadelphia. Thats more than twice as many deaths from homicide in that same year.From 2014-2015, 10% of the nearly 1,300 overdose deaths in Philadelphia were from non-residents. Most of those non-residents were people from New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and other parts of Pennsylvania.Once the president is elected, these issues wont go away. In fact, theyre extant  some as a surrogate to the system we attribute to healthcare. (One of the most hotly contested issues of partisan bickering in the country.)Additionally, these effects are increasingly felt in Philadelphia hospitals.The percentage of Philadelphia hospital emergency department visits related to opioid overdoses increased from approximately 0.4% in 2007 to nearly 0.7% in 2015. In 2015, there were over 6,500 emergency department visits for opioid overdoses. For each opioid-related death, there were approximately 12 hospital emergency department visits. So while the country politically corrects itself  whatever that means  myriad issues get buried beneath picking and choosing a side, in response to the emotional disturbances of partisan bickering.Rather than dealing with facts, the web of society becomes entangled with He Said, She Said.Ultimately, this coercive cultural backwardness and evolutionary substandard, the rattle-mouthed bickering of intellectual thought and deceptive, manipulative action, that matches up more closely with the reptilian species, rather than the spirit of the human heart and the cultural celebration of life and all its wonder, is exactly what gave rise to Trump.And our opioid epidemic.Somewhere along the way, the facts were buried beneath the lie. And the truth has become something else, entirely.http://www.phillyvoice.com/beer-drinkers-disavow-yuengling-after-owner-shows-support-for-trump/ The post  appeared first on We Are Change .
We Are Change One day after Julian Assange officially revealed for the first time that the source of hacked Podesta and DNC emails in Wikileaks possession is not Russia, in the second excerpt from the John Pilger Special, to be broadcast by RT on Saturday Julian Assange accuses Hillary Clinton of misleading Americans about the true scope of Islamic States support from Washingtons Middle East allies.As previously reported, in an August 17, 2014 email made public WikiLeaks last month, Hillary Clinton, who had served as secretary of state until the year before, urges John Podesta, then an advisor to Barack Obama, to bring pressure on Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIS and other radical Sunni groups.I think this is the most significant email in the whole collection, Assange, whose whistle-blowing site released three tranches of Clinton-related emails over the past year, told Pilger in the interview.As recounted by RT , Assange and Pilger, who sat down for their 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London where the whistleblower has been a refugee since 2012, also talked about the conflict of interest between Clintons official post, her husbands nonprofit, and the Middle East officials, whose stated desire to fight terrorism may not have been sincere.Julian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton  and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it  the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value.The conversation then turns to the imminent presidential election: Pilger questioned Assange over increasingly frequent accusations from the Clinton camp, and Western media, that WikiLeaks is looking to swing next weeks US presidential election in favor of Donald Trump  perhaps at Russias behest.However, just as he did last week, Assange again dismissed the prospect of Trump, who is almost tied in the polls, winning as unlikely, and not necessarily due to his standing with the electorate.Trump wont be permitted to win My analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, said Assange. Banks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton. And the media as well. Media owners, and the journalists themselves.JP: The accusations that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians and you hear people saying, Well, why doesnt WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia? JA: We have published over 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical. And  a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. And our documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases, refugee cases of people fleeing some kinds of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up.JP: Do you take yourself a view of the US election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? JA: Donald Trump  what does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash, deplorable and irredeemable. Basically, the same thing. It means, from a  establishment or educated, cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are, you know, like the rednecks, and you cant  like, they are just  you can never deal with them. And because he so clearly  through his words and actions and the type of people that turns up at his rallies  represents the people who are not the upper-middle-class-educated, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with that, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting in any way Trump, including criticizing Clinton. And if you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, it makes absolute sense.Sources; http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-04/julian-assange-says-trump-wont-be-allowed-win-clinton-and-isis-are-funded-same-money Twitter: https://twitter.com/Lukewearechange I nstagram: http://instagram.com/lukewearechange Sign up become a patron and Show your support for alternative news for Just 1$ a month you can help Grow We are change We use Bitcoin Too ! 12HdLgeeuA87t2JU8m4tbRo247Yj5u2TVP Join and Up Vote Our STEEMIT The post  appeared first on We Are Change .
We Are Change Video shows that Trump was in the middle of his speech when the incident occurred. He was looking into the crowd, his hand over his eyes to block the glare from the stage lights, when Secret Service agents grabbed him and escorted him off the stage. Trump ducked his head as he left the stage. The crowd panicked with frightened looks on their faces, as the Secret Service and police tactical units rushed in to quickly arrest the man.

In the schoolyard of American politics, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump stood tall Tuesday as he fired back at Vice President Joe Biden for a slam Biden sent his way last week.The press always asks me: Dont I wish I were debating him?

Share on Facebook This can result in fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, pale or yellow skin, irregular heartbeats, muscle weakness, mental confusion, unsteady movements, and mental confusion or forgetfulness. (1) Nobody wants to deal with those sort of health issues so pharmaceutical companies have come up with a solution: multivitamins. One of the most popular brands in America is Centrum. In one capsule, you can receive all the necessary nutrients you need to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It sounds too good to be true. And it is. Americans take this pill on a daily basis, and the only difference it makes to the consumer is a significantly lighter wallet. The World-Wide Popular Health Scam Named Centrum Last year, Centrum was ranked as the second leading U.S. multivitamin brand, its sales being 189.6 million American dollars. (2) This multivitamin was created by Pfizer, the world's largest pharmaceutical company. Pfizer is also dubbed manufacturer of fine chemicals, after a history of health care fraud and illegal marketing (3) that began soon after begin launched in 1849. (4) Despite its sketchy background, Centrum is extremely popular, probably due to the multi-billion dollar ad marketing campaign by Pfizer, most of which are trumped claims with dubious backings. (3) Why Centrum is Bad For Your Health Here is a list of Centrum's ingredients under three categories: 1. Minerals and Vitamins (with Poor Absorption) Calcium Carbonate  This is the least absorbable forms of calcium available in the market. Only a small percent is ingested into the body. Ferrous Fumarate  This iron supplement often causes constipation which causes an overgrowth of harmful flora. As a result, you may experience gastrointestinal issues, a compromised immune system, and problems with nutrient absorption. This is an obviously bad choice for a multivitamin. (5) DL-Alpha Tocopherol  This is a synthetic form a vitamin E supplement. Researchers at Oregon State University found that the body excretes this artificial form three times as faster than the natural. Meaning, the benefit is decreased threefold. (6) Nickelous Sulfate and Tin  This would be great if you had a nickel or tin deficiency. Except no one has this problem. Even so, when minerals are bound to a sulfate, this decrease their absorption ability. Talc  This is a mineral made up of mostly magnesium, silicon, and oxygen. However, talc can contain asbestos, a substance known to cause cancers. (7) 2. Fillers and Binders Pregelatinized Corn Starch  This is purely a binder with no benefits. It is likely to be made from genetically modified corn which creates a number of adverse reactions, especially for those who are sensitive to it. BHT  Butylated hydroxyanisole is a preservative that science has found to be toxic to the liver, thyroid, lungs, kidneys, and can affect blood coagulation. It can also promote tumors. Gelatin  This multivitamin is officially unfit for vegetarians and vegans. Hydrogenated Palm Oil  The process of hydrogenating any oil makes the oil rancid, turning it into a strong free radical which promotes cancer and heart disease. Sodium Benzoate  This is an overused preservative that has been shown to cause organ toxicity. Sodium Aluminosilicate  This common food additive for its anti-caking effects can cause health organ deterioration. It contributes to the detrimental properties of table salt. (8) 3. Artificial Colors FD&C Yellow No. 6 Aluminum Lake  Yes, there is food coloring in a multivitamin, and this one was actually derived from coal tar, a reproductive toxin. Studies found it to cause adrenal tumor in the lab animals. (9)(10) How To Choose a Good Multivitamin A health supplement should not have a minuscule amount of good properties with such detriment along with it. Instead, pick a multivitamin without additives and artificial colors, with the benefits of the vitamins are absorbed. It would be a good idea to choose a tried and true brand from a health food store as opposed to the commercially popular kinds found in a pharmacy. Remember you get what you pay for, and its better to pay for a better vitamin now than for disease treatment later on. Unfortunately, Centrum isn't the only health scam on the market. Most cheap multivitamins and supplements can do more harm than good. Many multivitamin trials have resulted in cardiovascular issues, depleted cognitive function, and acute respiratory tract infections. Especially in women, there has been cases of cancer and even mortality. (11) Of course, it would be optimal to simply eat all the nutrients we need. This can sometimes become challenging but, don't worry, you can still have your proper vitamins supplemented. Here are a few recommended brands: Douglas Labs
Share on Facebook Washington, D.C.  Billionaire globalist financier George Soros' MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump  exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation  and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. Wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle, and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today. In light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether it's an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous. Soros' affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: Americans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results. Hundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. Tonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesday's presidential election. The gatherings  organized by MoveOn.org and allies  will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trump's bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible. Within two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon. Now come reports from various protest locations that reveal a substantially coordinated effort, and not the organic grassroots showing by concerned Americans, as the mainstream media is reporting. Photos from Austin, Texas reveal a line of busses the protestors arrived in, making their appearance seem substantially less than organic  with a direct implication of being strategically orchestrated. Anti-Trump protestors in Austin today are not as organic as they seem. Here are the busses they came in. #fakeprotests #trump2016 #austin pic.twitter.com/VxhP7t6OUI  erictucker (@erictucker) November 10, 2016 With evidence mounting, the question must be asked; is George Soros working through his front organizations to foment an American revolution? @BeshoyBadie @desjax @erictucker Pretty evident that the signs were printed by Soros and Creamer groups. IIRC Soros linked w/ MB & Huma pic.twitter.com/KgXvIQr2b8  MEGATRON (@MEGATRONs SMIRK) November 10, 2016 Note that the group is actively organizing protests to a democratic election that no one is contesting the legitimacy of in terms of whether the vote was rigged, etc. Essentially, they are displeased with the results and are calling for people to rise up and not accept the results. For an organization that feigns to promote democracy, their actions speak otherwise. This is a disaster. We fought our hearts out to avert this reality. But now it's here, MoveOn.org staff wrote to members on Wednesday. The new president-elect and many of his most prominent supporters have targeted, demeaned, and threatened millions of usand millions of our friends, family, and loved ones. Both chambers of Congress remain in Republican hands. We are entering an era of profound and unprecedented challenge, a time of danger for our communities and our country. In this moment, we have to take care of ourselves, our families, and our friendsespecially those of us who are on the front lines facing hate, including Latinos, women, immigrants, refugees, Black people, Muslims, LGBT Americans, and so many others. And we need to make it clear that we will continue to stand together. Perhaps the most absurd part of the protests is that President-elect Trump hasn't made a single policy decision yet  and, in fact, the entire section of his website regarding banning Muslims was scrubbed shortly after his election. This denotes that anything said during the campaign was most likely simple election campaign rhetoric and subsequent framing of said rhetoric by the opposition. The left wing organization is one of a number of progressive organizations affiliated with Soros' Open Society Foundation. Soros-affiliated organizations across the world are deeply connected to various color revolutions, the Arab Spring, and a number of other political uprisings across the globe. According to a report in New Eastern Outlook: The totality of what is revealed in the three hacked documents show that Soros is effectively the puppet-master pulling most of the strings in Kiev. Soros Foundation's Ukraine branch, International Renaissance Foundation (IRF) has been involved in Ukraine since 1989. His IRF doled out more than $100 million to Ukrainian NGOs two years before the fall of the Soviet Union, creating the preconditions for Ukraine's independence from Russia in 1991. Soros also admitted to financing the 2013-2014 Maidan Square protests that brought the current government into power. Soros' foundations were also deeply involved in the 2004 Orange Revolution that brought the corrupt but pro-NATO Viktor Yushchenko into power with his American wife who had been in the US State Department. In 2004 just weeks after Soros' International Renaissance Foundation had succeeded in getting Viktor Yushchenko as President of Ukraine, Michael McFaul wrote an OpEd for the Washington Post. McFaul, a specialist in organizing color revolutions, who later became US Ambassador to Russia, revealed: Did Americans meddle in the internal affairs of Ukraine? Yes. The American agents of influence would prefer different language to describe their activities  democratic assistance, democracy promotion, civil society support, etc.  but their work, however labeled, seeks to influence political change in Ukraine. Anyone familiar with the history of the Soros Open Society Foundations in Eastern Europe and around the world since the late 1980's, will know that his supposedly philanthropic democracy-building projects in Poland, Russia, or Ukraine in the 1990's allowed Soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries' wealth, according to the New Eastern Outlook . During the 2016 presidential cycle, Soros committed $25 million dollars to the 2016 campaign of Hillary Clinton. Per the standard Clinton operating procedure, this was indicative of the symbiotic relationship of favors between the billionaire and his array of political puppets across the globe. As a testament to the power wielded by Soros, contained within WikiLeaks' recent release of hacked DNC emails, is a message from billionaire globalist financier George Soros to Hillary Clinton while she was U.S. Secretary of State, that clearly reveals Clinton as a Soros puppet. Found within the WikiLeaks' Hillary Clinton email archive is an email with the subject  Unrest in Albania , in which Soros makes clear to Clinton that two things need to be done urgently. He then directs the Secretary of State to bring the full weight of the international community to bear on Prime Minister Berisha and appoint a senior European official as mediator. Revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power, Soros then provides Secretary of State Clinton with three names from which to choose. Unsurprisingly, Clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by Soros  Miroslav Lajcak. Make no mistake that the events you're seeing transpire nationwide are being orchestrated in part by a billionaire political elite class that is looking to subvert the will of the American people by attempting to foment a new American revolution. Soros' formula has been duplicated in numerous nations, and it looks as if he now has the U.S. in his sights as the next target. Please share this critically import story in hope of waking people up to the globalist agenda at work here in America! Related:
America Has Become A Lawless Nation  Hillary Clinton Magically Cleared By The FBI By Michael Snyder, on July 5th, 2016 It is hard to be proud to be an American today after watching FBI director James Comey magically clear Hillary Clinton of all wrongdoing. Sadly, Comey is likely to go down in history as the man that struck the final death blow to the rule of law in America. During his address to the media, Comey admitted that Clinton sent or received 110 emails in 52 email chains that contained classified material at the time they were sent. But of course there were probably many more. Comey told the press that it was  likely that there are other work-related emails that they did not produce _ that are now gone because they deleted all emails they did not return to State, and the lawyers cleaned their devices . So basically Clinton turned over to the FBI whatever she felt like turning over, and then she destroyed the rest of the evidence. As a former lawyer, this infuriates me, but it doesnt surprise me. In fact, it doesnt surprise me at all that Hillary Clinton was allowed to skate. I expected this all along. If you search the thousands of articles that I have posted on The Economic Collapse Blog and End Of The American Dream , you will find many articles where I say that Hillary Clinton should be in prison, but not a single one where I ever said that I thought she would be going to prison. This is how politics in America works today. People like Bill and Hillary Clinton could openly sacrifice children to Satan on the White House lawn and still probably not get into trouble. Despite scandal after scandal going all the way back to Arkansas in the 1980s, nothing ever sticks to them, and nothing probably ever will. In this case, FBI director James Comey essentially had to rewrite federal law in order to clear Clinton. This is something that Andrew McCarthy explained very well in his article entitled FBI Rewrites Federal Law to Let Hillary Off the Hook _ There is no way of getting around this: According to Director James Comey (disclosure: a former colleague and longtime friend of mine), Hillary Clinton checked every box required for a felony violation of Section 793(f) of the federal penal code (Title 18): With lawful access to highly classified information she acted with gross negligence in removing and causing it to be removed it from its proper place of custody, and she transmitted it and caused it to be transmitted to others not authorized to have it, in patent violation of her trust. Director Comey even conceded that former Secretary Clinton was extremely careless and strongly suggested that her recklessness very likely led to communications (her own and those she corresponded with) being intercepted by foreign intelligence services.  In essence, in order to give Mrs. Clinton a pass, the FBI rewrote the statute, inserting an intent element that Congress did not require. The added intent element, moreover, makes no sense: The point of having a statute that criminalizes gross negligence is to underscore that government officials have a special obligation to safeguard national defense secrets; when they fail to carry out that obligation due to gross negligence, they are guilty of serious wrongdoing. The lack of intent to harm our country is irrelevant. People never intend the bad things that happen due to gross negligence. The amazing thing is that the FBI handled a highly similar case very, very differently less than a year ago. Just check out what happened to Naval reservist Bryan Nishimura _ U.S. Magistrate Judge Kendall J. Newman immediately sentenced Nishimura to two years of probation, a $7,500 fine, and forfeiture of personal media containing classified materials. Nishimura was further ordered to surrender any currently held security clearance and to never again seek such a clearance. According to court documents, Nishimura was a Naval reservist deployed in Afghanistan in 2007 and 2008. In his role as a Regional Engineer for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Nishimura had access to classified briefings and digital records that could only be retained and viewed on authorized government computers. Nishimura, however, caused the materials to be downloaded and stored on his personal, unclassified electronic devices and storage media. He carried such classified materials on his unauthorized media when he traveled off-base in Afghanistan and, ultimately, carried those materials back to the United States at the end of his deployment. In the United States, Nishimura continued to maintain the information on unclassified systems in unauthorized locations, and copied the materials onto at least one additional unauthorized and unclassified system . Nishimuras actions came to light in early 2012, when he admitted to Naval personnel that he had handled classified materials inappropriately . Nishimura later admitted that, following his statement to Naval personnel, he destroyed a large quantity of classified materials he had maintained in his home . Despite that, when the Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Nishimuras home in May 2012, agents recovered numerous classified materials in digital and hard copy forms. The investigation did not reveal evidence that Nishimura intended to distribute classified information to unauthorized personnel. So what is the difference between Nishimura and Clinton? Neither of them ever intended to do anything wrong. So why were they treated so differently? Needless to say, social media is exploding with outrage over this decision to let Clinton go free. Many Americans are openly asking why they should continue to play by the rules if politicians like Hillary Clinton are not required to do so. Unfortunately, this is what America has become. Our politicians are a reflection of who we are as a society, and as I have stated before Hillary Clinton is going to be the overwhelming favorite if there is an election in November. At this moment, she has solid leads in all of the swing states, and she only really needs to win one of them _ Perhaps you enjoy talk of battleground states. Well, theres a scenario for you, too. First, pick the six closest swing states (VA, NH, IA, OH, FL, NC). Got it? Now understand that New Hampshire excepted, Clinton only has to win one of them in order to reach the requisite 270 electoral votes to win . (Optional third step for Republicans only: start shotgunning Pabst Blue Ribbon and dont stop until November.) Lest any Trump supporters seek solace in poll numbers, recent polls have Trump sliding further behind in all the relevant swing states. According to a Ballotpedia battleground poll released last week, Trump trails by 14% in Florida, 4% in Iowa, 10% in North Carolina, 9% in Ohio, and 7% in Virginia. Hillary Clinton is a horrible, evil, miserable human being , and right now she is the odds-on favorite to become the next president of the United States. But ultimately it is the American people that are to blame for blindly supporting corrupt politicians such as Clinton, and if they willingly pick her to be our next president then we will certainly deserve whatever consequences follow. The Price Of Silver Explodes Past 20 Dollars An Ounce As The European Banking Crisis Deepens  Daddyotis I struggle trying to get my head around this. It goes against all reasonable consideration of law and civilized society. What refocuses and grounds me is when I consider that this is another puzzle piece of end time prophecy being put into place. This brings me closer to an understanding of Gods will for me and my place in it all. The best part is that I am already saved and cleared for the afterlife. God Bless all DO Michael Dubin Presidents Clinton, Bush II, and Obama have gotten away with murder, so why would anyone think that Hillary would be charged over some illegal server? K Well the final proof. We have the best Government and law enforcement money can buy. Amf boy have they been bought. A Republic requires an informed electorate.to survive. And we sure do not have that. So welcome to the new America, all the justice you can afford/ Steeve Girard dude_ accidental web address electorate (dot) to Michle We turned on the TV just to watch the announcement that Comey had to make about Clinton. Just as he made the announcement that indicated that their recommendations to the DOJ would be to not press charges, that very second a loud boom went off in my house sounding exactly like a cannon and my husband and both sons saw a purple bolt of lightning outside and a ball of fire and then my TV froze with the words coming out Aof Comeys mouth. Ive never experienced anything like that in my life. We all felt that it had spiritual implications in regards to the announcement made. aldownunder What did you do then?

Infidel51 So the Tower of Sauron rises. Who is willing to stand against it? Q Lest any Trump supporters seek solace in poll numbers, recent polls have Trump sliding further behind in all the relevant swing states. The lamestream medias are prepparing us for a massive Democrat voter fraud campaign in those states. Bevy You are right Redlucy!!! We are going to go thru judgment because of our rampant sin and only a small remnant will survive!!! im4truth4all James Comey has joined James Clapper, John Koskinen, John Kerry, etc. I have lived almost 74 years and have never seen as corrupt an administration as this one. My estimate of years left based on my genetic profile is probably 5 to 10 years. I feel sorry for my descendants. I personally feel this country is in the last years of its existence. Kent Harris 9/11 was Gods judgment against this nation. Please read the Isaiah 9:10 prophesy and then read what God will do to this nation as a result of our defiance from Isaiah 9:11-10:4. He will utterly destroy this nation. You say that God will never do such a thing. He will and know this that when you walk into church, any church and see if any pulpits says anything at all about this this coming Sunday. The answer will be no. God in the prophecy says the pulpit is wholly to blame. During the homosexual marriage issue how many pulpits came out against this abomination? None. Why? Because God has blinded just like pharaoh of Egypt the pulpit. They have been consumed with the outward versus the inward. They are vipers among vipers. Steeve Girard 911 was the warning of the Arab World_ the Americans ignored it with exceptionalism. Time to cough-up. bahmi 911 was meant to blame Muslims for everything connected, but the jews and neocons were behind 911, along with the Saudis. This was, however, a distraction so the real bad guys could install people like Obongo and let his destructive agenda destroy us, choke us in debt, focus on homosexuality, same sex butt banging, etc. While we were occupied with the distractions, the real bad guys did their thing and now have us on the precipice of total destruction and NWO marginalization. If you voted for Obama, YOU are part of the problem. GV _focus on homosexuality, same sex butt banging_. ever obsessed with Teh Gays Paul Patriot Amen. This Is why I am convinced Hitlery will be the next president. Its all apart of the plan to destroy American Constitution and sovereignty during her reign She is what the sheeple, illegals and liberal, progressives are calling for, and the Lord will oblige the desires of those who mock, blaspheme and spit in the face of the God of our heritage, natures God Nothing will change until the pulpits start preaching Truth and a nation repents JC Teecher All is going along with the prophetic word and the nations are aiding and abetting to the fullness of the Gentiles, (islamic peoples). JC Teecher The pulpits, for the most part, are bringing about the apostasy. sad No, the church wants to be liked and civil in this matter. Sin is a three letter bad word. Churches are more interested incommunity and not scaring people off with the truth. Unfortunately, that is the majority of churches today.They didnt scare me. The only truth that scared me was Hell and I was scared into the kingdom by Gods love for me a sinner. That He died for me to save me. Dont hear much about that these days. Politically incorrect. on the way to Hell. Jerry C Actually, Id say sin is a five-letter word, death. lol watchmannonthewall I somewaht agree with you regarding Gods move against the US, but I tend more towards 9/11 being one of a couple of disciplines and warnings, the 2008 meltdown was the other, regarding coming judgment on the nation rather than it actually being a judgment. If Athaliah becomes president, she will be just like the real Athaliah; narcissistic and paranoid, and her rage will extend to Christians. She is power hungary and has a self destruct button that will take all with her. At that point, I think it quite likely the warnings of the destruction of America by about 2020-21 will probably occur. Joe Trevors I believe we are experiencing the End Times battle between the Body of Christ & the Body of Antichrist. Our war is not against flesh & blood but against the spiritual powers on high. Yes, Kent, you do see how our nation is being transformed by the installation of leaders in our society who are following the Antichrist. But also our nation is filled with millions of people who are following the Christ. One way I see this is to view Islam as the Trojan Horse to bring down Christianity. Yes, it is bringing down the Church but it cannot hurt the Head of the Church, Jesus, so it is making war on the Body of Christ, the members one of another. You can today how Islam is being used by our government to destroy the Church in Syria? Muslims are killing Christians & other Muslims in Syria. NowAlive Perhaps Mr Cahn is right. Its an interesting premise, to be sure. What I will say is that the idea that none, meaning no pulpits spoke out against homosexual marriage, is simply wrong. Many spoke of judgment because of it. But you are certainly right about vipers filling the most pulpits. They are indeed blind. Alas that the Baby Boomers now run this country_off a cliff. GV _During the homosexual marriage issue how many pulpits came out against this abomination? None_. Pharisee, fixated on genitalia while remaining SILENT on American war crimes around the world She is the next president of America. Joe Trevors Only God knows who will be the next President. It is important for us to pray to the Lord & trust God as we say the Lords prayer in part, Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. We need our faith more than ever during these days of tribulations. God can do anything he wants. God answers our prayers but we do not understand how he answers us, do we? Oz Steamer She looks likely to be the LAST President of the United States. Jerry C Why would TPTB collapse the economy on one of their own? My gut says they want a white conservative Christian male at the helm to blame it on, so Trump is the man of the hour.

If there was any man or woman who you would think of as having some kind of Divine protection, it would be this gods right hand man, right?? Mark The pope is the head of the Roman Catholic Church.

Randy Yeah, well its not much of a god who would let His only begotten Son be tortured to death then. No thanks, Ill take a pass on that one there. And a REAL God would have infinite love and compassion for His inferior Creations along with complete understanding, so to laugh at and deride us would not be in keeping with the attributes of a REAL god.

They did not want to infringe on Omars constitutional rights because Obama forbids us to discriminate against Muslims. Omar got a job at a security company so he could protect us. Omars Dad was preaching what Omar followed. Omars Dad works for the CIA. The FBI was forbidden to bother Omar no matter what he threatened. The FBI does not even know to investigate Omars dad. What about the MOSQUE where Omar worshipped? The FBI is super good  in covering up!! Randy GREAT post there, Joe! Except that Orlando was a completely contrived event, just like Sandy Hoax.

Check The Old Farmers Almanac for the weather reports on the 14th and 15th. Joe Trevors Yes, how can they cover up so much with so little outrage from them in Orlando? Randy Quite easily! Since the media is in bed with the corrupted legal system and political system, they just ignore the outrage, they dont report on it, therefore very few ever hear about it! Someone forgot to check the records to see what the weather would possibly be like on December 14, 2012, and thats how that very important clue got left out of the narrative when the hoax was launched!

Joe Trevors Our greatest hope is to vote for Donald Trump. I believe God is using Donald. It is a sign by the overwhelming opposition against him by both Democrats & Republicans. Look at Republican Paul Ryan as House Majority leader: he has no trouble understanding Obama or Clinton. But he cant understand Trump? Paul say I dont know where Donald is coming from. Trump is exposing how we are already ruled by a ONE PARTY OLIGARCHY, that chooses who will be President. This time Trump is confounding their agenda. Trump is revealing how they are all lying to us & of course they all really support Hillary or a 3rd party candidate. Arent they the ones who say Anyone but Trump? JC Teecher Look at the bright side, even though it is just a dying ember of one, this brings the chosen one to the final phase of taking her pedestal of satanic hierarchy in ussag, and will eliminate the need for martial law in order to stave off the trump charge. I still believe we will see bank failures and an economic collapse whereby she will pull the exact same stunts as Odrama did, to filter off funds, but; I think it will stabilize after the haircut to the upper middle class wealth.

Archives Michaels Latest Video What Is Causing The Strange Noises In The Sky That Are Being Heard All Over The World? By Michael Snyder, on March 22nd, 2012 During the second half of 2011, a lot of people all over the planet started reporting hearing really strange noises coming from the sky. In some instances the noises produced a loud rumbling such as a train, a thunderstorm or the slamming of a heavy door would make. In other instances, the noises sounded more like groaning. In yet other instances the noises sounded almost as if a trumpet was playing. Dozens of videos went up on YouTube purporting to document this phenomenon, but the truth is that you can fake almost anything on a YouTube video and many dismissed these strange strange sounds as an Internet hoax. However, now entire towns in the northern part of the United States are hearing strange noises in the sky and the mainstream media is reporting on it. In fact, one U.S. town is planning to spend thousands of dollars to hire an engineering firm to investigate where these strange sounds are coming from. At this point a lot of theories about these strange noises are being floated, but so far scientists have not been able to give us a definitive explanation for the source of these strange noises. So exactly what in the world is going on? This phenomenon made national news again this week because of what has been going on in Clintonville, Wisconsin. Hundreds of residents of Clintonville reported hearing incredibly loud noises coming from the sky for several nights in a row. Even CBS News is reporting on what is happening in Clintonville_. Since Sunday, the residents have been disturbed by booming noises loud enough to wake them from their sleep. Last night, hundreds of people attended a public meeting to get to the bottom of booms. But they arent any closer to the truth. One resident told CBS News, The last few days weve been having (a) booming shaking noise. Another resident said, (For) a lot of people the house is rattling, you can feel the ground rattling, and its booming all the time. Its kind of like, whats going on? You dont know whats happening. So what is causing these noises that are so loud that even the ground is shaking? According to Fox News , the town has investigated every possible explanation that they can think of for these strange noises_. City officials say they have investigated every possible human cause. They checked water, sewer and gas lines, contacted the military about any exercises in the area, reviewed permits for mining explosives and inspected a dam next to City Hall. They even tested methane levels at the landfill in case the gas was spontaneously exploding. So far no explanation has been found. So Clintonville has decided to spend $7,000 to hire an engineering firm to investigate the cause of these strange noises. According to geologists, the town does not sit on any fault lines and the ground beneath the town is very solid. Some geologists are claiming that  micro-quakes  could have been responsible, but others find this explanation to be very unsatisfying. For many town residents, solving the mystery is not as important as getting these strange noises to stop so that they can get some sleep. The following comes from the recent Fox News article mentioned above_. My husband thought it was cool, but I dont think so. This is not a joke, said Jolene Van Beek, who awoke early Sunday to a loud boom that shook her house. I dont know what it is, but I just want it to stop. But Clintonville is not the only town in Wisconsin where strange sounds are being reported. Mysterious noises are also being reported in a town called Montello which is 80 miles away from Clintonville. Posted below is a local news report that discusses the strange noises that are being reported in Clintonville and Montello_. These strange sounds have made the mainstream news up in Canada as well. Recently, strange noises caused such a violent shaking that they actually brought down a barn on Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Geologists say that no earthquake occurred at the time that the barn collapsed. So what caused the barn to collapse? That is a very good question. And this is not just a North American phenomenon. If you go on to YouTube and you do a search for strange sounds or strange noises you will find dozens of videos from all over the world. Yes, there are definitely a few videos that appear to be hoaxes, but is that true with all of them? The evidence for this phenomenon is mounting and it is getting really hard to deny that there really are large numbers people all over the globe that swear that they are hearing really strange sounds coming from the sky. So exactly what in the world is going on? Well, there are a lot of theories floating around on the Internet. The following are some of the most prominent theories about what is causing these strange noises: electromagnetic noise, earthquakes, fracking, rock bursts, venting of high-pressure gas that has been trapped underground, meteor showers, HAARP or directed energy weapons, and some believe that all of this is just a giant publicity stunt. Perhaps the biggest reason why these strange noises have so many people alarmed is because humans generally have a great fear of the unknown. If the cause of these strange noises is revealed, the hysteria will die down. But if these strange noises continue (or even become more intense) and there continues to be no scientific explanation for them, then the hysteria may turn into full-blown panic. What is clear is that our planet is becoming increasingly unstable. As I have documented previously, earthquakes are becoming more frequent and more powerful. The  Ring of Fire  is becoming a lot more active and we have been seeing a disturbing amount of volcanic activity lately. So could earth changes have anything to do with these strange noises? We just dont know at this point. Most of the time when I write an article I like to have some answers. But I do not know what is causing these strange sounds. So what do you think about these strange noises? Do you believe that you know why they are happening? Have you heard strange sounds coming from the sky where you live? Please feel free to share your thoughts by leaving a comment below_. It is necessary to determine the origin of these sounds: natural or artificial. I think these sounds are artificial, for nature as it is not natural. But I admit that I could be wrong. ScoutMotto I dont doubt that some of the videos are valid, however I heard one from I think Hungary where amidst the groaning sounds, there was a piece of music played backward for a couple seconds. I sampled the soundtrack, played it backward in Goldwave, and it sounded like a short percussion piece. Hard to take that one seriously, which causes doubt to be cast on others of like style. But, Im not writing it all off just yet. Guido Heraldsofthemorn The destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 is an example of the destruction of the world at the end of time, see Matthew 24 and the book The Great Controversy. Here is a paragraph from the book Great Controversy that tells of signs and wonders before the destruction. Signs and wonders appeared, foreboding disaster and doom. In the midst of the night an unnatural light shone over the temple and the altar. Upon the clouds at sunset were pictured chariots and men of war gathering for battle. The priests ministering by night in the sanctuary were terrified by mysterious sounds; the earth trembled, and a multitude of voices were heard crying: Let us depart hence. The great eastern gate, which was so heavy that it could hardly be shut by a score of men, and which was secured by immense bars of iron fastened deep in the pavement of solid stone, opened at midnight, without visible agency.Milman, The History of the Jews, book 13.  {GC 29.3} Could these sounds that are being heard be part of the signs and wonders before the end? Mike Ayala Greetings, You have no idea how unstable the earth really is! Humanity is going to have a wake-up call one day that is going to make the movie 2012 look patheticly simplistic and relatively uneventful in comparison. The problem stems from the release of heat as rock falls through magma: the volume of the rock decreases as it melts, and at the same time it releases enough heat energy to melt many times its original volume  some suggest enough heat to melt 88-times the original volume. (You should gasp about now.) Up to the present we have enjoyed relative stability, a sort of sliding equillibrium, but that is changing at an increasingly rapid exponential rate which can be quantified by examining the increasing rate of Great earthquakes (8-plus) over the last 100 years which is startling to say the least. Some parts of the crust will be affected more than other, but all will feel the pain. The worst economic collapse ever will be remembered as the good old days in comparison to the run-away stage of this process. The recognition of this process gives new meaning to the prophecy, There will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. The noises and shakings noted in the article probably do not have anything to do with this crust-contraction phenonenon, but there is coming a day when all who dwell on the earth will fear for the things they see and experience coming upon the earth. Hence, the most important preparation one can make is to prepare to meet God. For some it will be a time of exceeding joy; For the rest it will be the time of judgement and eternal torment and regret. Send me an email, and I will get you more information about this topic. God bless and protect you all. Mike Ayala JR So, Mike, how do we contact you, then? Or can you point us to the source of your information? Thanks! Mike Ayala Hi JR, The easiest way is to call and order a copy of a recent lecture given at Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa at the February Creation Science Investigation conference on 20120218. They are not a lot of money. The particular lecture covering this topic was: Earthquakes Kevin Lea 2/18/12 This one was a real eye-opener. I knew about the exponential increase in great earthquakes, but the magma details and the Pacific Ocean abberation/collapse/indentation were new to me. Another great presentation given at the same conference was by John Sanford: Genetic Entropy Dr. John Sanford 2/18/12 This one is about how the human gene pool is decayng at an astounding rate of conservatively 100-200 mutations per generation plus transcription errors in every cell division and what is the significance of these two factors. It does not paint a pretty picture. The bottom line is that we have no hope in this present world: All that we take for granted and hold dear will perish. We need to have our hope firmly rooted on the Rock of Jesus Christ who will regenerate our bodies and renew our minds and make a new heaven and earth in which righteousness will dwell. God bless and protect you and your family. Mike Ayala Ken West yes I would like to read more about this subject. Would appreciate what info. you have. Thanks Hollow earth theory coming alive. Underground civilizations in which all of our gold and other PMs are transfered to are having underground wars that are heating up, similar to the quakes on the east coast in VA to NY MB92083 Just saw on Fox news (Gretta V.S.) that the mystery was solved. They said it was caused by a minor (1.something) earthquake. This only applied to the WI incident. Blustery Day And of course you never change the channel. Fox is not reliable. They tell you what they want you to believe. PandaStar and that is different from any other news or network? Curtis In October of 2011, my wife and I were on our way to Lake Tahoe on highway 88 coming down the mountain toward highway 50 when we suddenly heard within our car (windows up), a sound so loud that it sounded as if a freight train was right next to our vehicle. This is an area that is pristine. There are no trains around. It was unexplainable. mondobeyondo There is still a lot more about our planet that we dont know, than what we do know. Just like any arrogant teenager, we think we know it all_ mark The only sounds that we hear on our ranch at his time of year are frogs and the creek that runs by our house. Oh yes, we cant forget about the dogs, the coyotes, owls at night,cows,birds, a car or truck once in a while and sometimes a chain saw. Lets not forget the sound of the wind in the trees or the rain hitting the roof. I guess we have not heard the groans of the earth yet. Gary2 All the strange sounds are coming from all the echo from Rush in conservatives empty heads. And yet another study showing conservatives to be dumb. Dont Drink and Vote: New Study Says Alcohol (And General Thoughtlessness) Makes People More Conservative Getting drunk is known to cause erratic, irrational, and, overall, thoughtless behavior  public urination, bar fights, tears in the streets. Now, go ahead and add political conservatism to that list. A new study, published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, tested whether low-effort thought promotes political conservatism, and part of the study measured alcohols effects on political positions. Researchers found that the higher the blood alcohol content, the more conservative the views on sex, education, and political identification became. Researchers hypothesized that drinking turns people Republican because political conservatism arises in the absence of deliberate thought. People with a lot on their minds, under time constraints, or told to respond in a cursory manner, rather than think deeply and use recognition memory  an indicator of effortful thought  were also more conservative. Together these data suggest that political conservatism may be a process consequence of low-effort thought, the study concluded. The less you think (or more you drink), the more conservative you become? Shocker! Cheers to the right-wing. Guido That doesnt sound subjective at all_ DownWithLibs So, you WERE dropped on your head when you were born_only explanation!!!! Justa Guy I dont know about groans of the earth, but I think Im hearing groans of the blog right about now_ Drunk Gary2 In other words DRINK UP and PARTY ON DUDE! P.S.  This explains why Berkeley and other party spots are such bastions of conservatism. Those damn conservatives are having too much fun. Its time for liberals to lighten up an tie one on. Guido I dont think this is inexplicable. Years ago, in the 1980s, San Franciscos boat people all reported loud, unusual noises coming from the bay. Theories ran wild, including Soviet subs, until scientists figured out it was the toadfish mating call. There are also lots of stories over the years about inexplicable humming in certain towns and areas. http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=91912&page=1#.T2v9XdlVXTc Heres an article on the Kokomo Hum. I dont know if theres any similarity, but it wouldnt surprise me. Perhaps the region sits on a nice piece of rock that can resonate like a tuning fork when it gets the right signal. Perhaps it is geological activity-we have seen a lot of earthquake activity in recent years. Who knows? Guido I watched one of the videos. It reminded me of the gag at the end of Red State where the kids fool the extremist church holdouts with trumpets played over an old fire department horn and convince them its the end of the world_ Gary2wannabe Meeshall has been farting. Kannibal In Fresno, CA, this is a daily occurrence. The sound happens suddenly without any build up. It is extremely loud like 10 Jets, and shakes my walls and windows. Sometimes it suddenly just stops without fading away like a jet normally would. Sometimes it rumbles the sky for minutes at a time. Ill be outside sometimes when it happens and look up in the sky but there is never anything there. Clear skies and no airplanes. I once heard a rumble at around 2am and ran outside to see if I could spot anything. What I saw was in the sky to the southwest. It was about 14 red lights it the formation of a boomerang and you couldnt see between them. The space they took up was about the size of a football field. It was traveling very slowly as if it were slowly descending continuing southwest. I have never seen anything like this in my life. It sent a chill down my spine and I called out for my wife. She ran out and started freaking out. I know this sounds crazy but maybe it was just our government playing with there new toys. GunRights4US Clearly Gods pissed, and rightfully so. Sodom and Gomoarah had nothing on modern man in terms of pure evil. Man has an appointment to keep, whether he likes it or not. John You are about the only one who is closer to the truth than anyone could ever imagine_ David M Maybe its an SSTO. Single Stage To Orbit spacecraft. Being run by our government making runs to orbit. It would have powerful engines to accelerate to orbit and would leave a long thunderous noise trail. Including sonic booms, that would shake the Earth, as it got up to a minimum of several thousand miles an hour. Someone should compare the sounds to a Shuttle launch. Ripplewind Mother Earth is preparing for war against us. Andrew Kind God is shaking what can be shaken before His Son returns. karen Its Mother Earth giving you warning signs, but of course most will say its all a joke. And for christains its the same as in the bible_ And the trumpets shall sound, you are being given a warning of things to come real soon. even the goverment knows this, they just dont want you to know, thats why a new executive order just came into effect 16 Mar 2012 National Defence Resources Preparedness they own everything you have now right down to a chicken in your yard. There is a great video out called 5 reasons why America will have the worst riots in the world, awesome truth!!! Anna On January 23rd I heard the noises , the deep and high trumpet/ groaning type, not the boom, but I was terrified, it was omnidirectional, not point of origin. When I compared what I heard to the sound of some of the Shofar videos , my hair stood on end. It was nearly identical, only on a much grander scale. Could be a deception, we are warned, Let no man deceive you, could be the real deal as well. Only God know and that is enough for me, He says 365 times in His Word, do not fear, so I have to trust Him. Walk with Christ and He will keep you fearless. Emily I do not say this lightly or with humor, Mother Earth is in pain and we are hearing her sorrow. Please remember, YAHWEH brought forth all life from Earth and she cries out for her children. JR Could it be the sound of our economy imploding under the feckless administration of Jimmy Carter Obama? Some people are talking about a coming magnetic poleshift (nothing new, has happened before), maybe the magnetic field are making those sounds? Intresting article Michael. Sunshine Yes, curious on magnetic shifting for possibility. Consider that one of the things said to be saturating the atmosphere through SRM, Solar Radiation Management is aluminum particles. Now, as far as I know, aluminum is NON magnetic. Disrupting the electromagnetic waves of the sunlight could be a factor in climate change since the sun plays a very big part in natural weather patterns. Could interfering with magnetic waves also cause strange noise? Now, why go to this great effort with such great risk? It could cause extreme weather patterns including melting the north pole. HAARP, the Aurora spy plane, fracking, and Biblical end of age signs? jason In january of this year i herd a noise coming out of the sky. I live in the wisconsin dells and at that time i could sweare a T-rex was going to come charging out of the woods at any moment. it was a little unsettling to see videos on youtube that show the same sound all over the world. at first i passed the sound off to be some kind of amplification to the mile away freeway but at 3 am the freeway is not that active. so what the hell is it? Newman Noggs Auroras can cause strange sounds from a distance, but usually they crackle, not boom. I would look for evidence of electromagnetic activity: increased ground voltage, St. Elmos fire, etc. From what Ive read this is not a new phenomenon. Look up Seneca Guns. http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/booms.php Billy Note to Gary2: You are indeed an idiot. MB92083 Ill second that! Hes a nice guy, but delusional and brainwashed. Benjik Im thoroughly convinced Gary2 is actually an extreme right-winger dead-set at portraying liberals/progressives to be extremely foolish and misinformed. Thats the only rational explanation_.. Proftel Because only in the Northern Hemisphere? ? Jim It is the US gov playing with thier reversed engineered alien stealth spacecraft. I have also heard (with my sister) what sounded like a large flying spacecraft right over our heads with NOTHING around but sky. It was NOT a natural phenominum as soulded man made.

I will suggest looking up Tesla Technology GMA215 The so-called experts have now announced that the noises in WI are from a swarm of mini-earthquakes. Yeah. Sure they are. Saq Its called the government. Possibly drilling more underground tunnels??!! babygirlway Thursday morning I woke up at around 5:00 a.m. hearing some sort of loud pounding noise coming from outside. It was repetitive. Our windows were open because it has been unusually warm for March in the Indianapolis area. So warm in fact that I had my large, remote control fan on next to my bed that I purchased last summer to help with my middle aged night sweats. LOL. Anyway, I had enough time to wake up and hear the noise above the fan, turn off the fan and still hear it going_.it woke my husband up as well. It was not a construction noise. I never did figure out what it was. Did anyone else in the Indy area hear it? Benjik Something I have wondered about for years and never received a valid explanation on is what are the effects of pumping billions of barrels of oil out of the Earth with nothing to replace it? Wouldnt that internally effect the general mass of our planet? How does that void effect the Earths rotation, gravitational properties, points of axis, etc? Think of the old spinning egg science experiment. When the internal properties of an egg are altered (boiled vs. raw), it has a direct effect on how it reacts to spinning it on a hard surface. Could this may be happening on a global scale? Any feedback would be appreciated. OldManNoal FINALLY SOMEONE IS ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS!!! youre onto something MASSIVE Benjik Marilynn The other night I had difficulty sleeping. I can always hear the hum, although it varies in volume, but I just ignore it. This time it was accompanied by an occasional groaning sound. It wasnt very loud and I know it wasnt a vehicle driving by or an airplane because it didnt increase and diminish. Just a few seconds of a low groaning, then five to 10 seconds later it repeated about five or six times. The next day I read about the noises in Wisconsin. My guess is that it has something to do with military testing, perhaps some sort of sound wave experiment. This much is not theoretical: The government is ALWAYS engaged in experimentation of all sortschemical, biological, nuclear, electro-magnetic, geo-engineering, mind control, etc.and they have no ethical qualms about testing this crap on human populations. yes,it is all in the new book, MAYDAY IN JOPLIN Gary2 I figured out what the noises are_Gog and Magog are tusseling over who gets to kick the beasts ass. mackie Sounds are the results of vibrations. And vibrations can be a result from many different events. Such as space quakes, which are the magnetic field lines which do compasses our earth and out into space. When we recieve a solar flare from the sun, these magnetic field lines are push or moved, and when two of these magnetic field lines touch each other they cause what is called a space quake. A space quake is a loud vibrating sound which is from the sky, and can be felt through the air, ground, and can even rattle your house. Another thing which can influence as well our earth is a heavy object such as a dwarf star, or planet x, or even a comet. These will either pull or push our orbital cycle, or even casue the earth to real to and fro like a drunkerd. Even thirdly, the earths core could be heating up, just like the rest of the planets in our solar system due to the suns output which has changed so much and is effecting all the planets. A warmer core would cause the increase of rotation of the earth. There is also the fluff in space as well which is effecting the sun, and everything else. There is so many things which we are not taught, but the information is out there for the learning if one wishes to go out and research it. We are blessed to have such a great resource through the internet. In life It is always a cause and effect. A.S. Michael, you already gave one reason, which is the most likely one: HAARP. It is the U.S. using HAARP for whatever selfish purposes, like attempting to subvert countries like China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, etc, to trade between themselves with their own currencies. The U.S. did it before and they will do it again. Jes http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/what-are-the-strange-noises-in-the-sky-being-heard-all-over-the-world Booming Sounds could this be the result?  Heres an excerpt on what really happened at the time of the Great Deluge (Noahs Flood). It was a cataclysmic.  Geologists have recognized that these ridges are fracture lines on the earths crust. They have estimated some 200 million years ago the continents were joined together as one piece, and they have named this supercontinent Pangea. A model of the Pangea was presented in the section, Creation Mysteries. Since then Pangea broke up as a result of the earths Crust breaking up into pieces, or plates, which have since been drifting from each other or drifting towards each other. Thus the Americas are moving at a rate of an inch from Europe and Africa per year. The present separation is about 3,000 miles. The major mountain chains of the world such as the Alps and the Himalayas were formed by the collision of plates bearing these continental masses against each other. In other areas the collision caused one plate to go under the other as in the case of the Pacific plate moving under western edge of the US continent. This process is still continuing, hence the periodic earthquakes in California_ Read more here_ http://www.biblediscoveries.com/content/view/17/34/ Yeshua(Jesus) did say: Matityahu (Matthew) 24:37-41 As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage_.. The End will be cataclysmic just as was the Beginning. Tesla2011 Haha, its sad billions or millions of earthlings have no clue. Its clear, what this is and I would only say this, the earth magnetic pole shifts and the layers of earth are all being testes and purposley being manipulated by mad scientist. Ofcourse, already its sounds mad bc, you ppl cant belive it or the science of mechaniscim. This object is the one and only worlds most dangerous weapon_ Thats High frequency Auroa Atmosphere Reasearc Program. The man, who created is the worlds genuis of all centuries. His name is Nikola Tesla and is the inventor of the electromagnetic transmitter gha would be later deveolped as a top notch weapon. Guido I suggested earlier the noise could be large rock formations underground resonating from earth movements. Beneath Wisconsin and other states in the region is a massive granite formation called the Superior Upland Shield. The US Navy exploits the resonating qualities of the shield to transmit Extreme Low Frequency communications with submerged submarines. Theyre broadcasting at about 8 watts. The ELF transmitters are slow, but they can use the planet itself to transmit their signals to subs underwater in any ocean. Perhaps this sheild, or some other piece of rock can pick up earth movements and magnify them into those peculiar sounds. One of the ELF antenna arrays is located at Clam Lake, WI, which is only 20 miles drive from Clintonville, WI. I have no proof, but the idea is no less plausible than other ideas Ive heard_ Bruce The Bible says in Romans 8 that all of nature groans ( waiting for the return of Jesus) and in Matthew 24 that ALL these things_earthquakes, wars and rumors of wars, a decline in morals (and I am quite certain, even strange sounds)_when you see ALL these things beginning to happen look up for your redemption isnt too far off_time to get your heart right with God. BluButterfly I keep hearing a lot of really far out theories, and I find them all fascinating. However, the best answer is sometimes the simplest and most obvious. Has anyone ever tried correlating these strange noises to the increasing solar activity? Recently we have been seeing lots of solar flares, suspots, etc and they are definitely affecting the high incidence of Northern Lights in the past year. Some geologists (in Finnland and Germany) are saying the sun has not been this magnetically active in over 1000 years. One of the best sites to read about and track this solar activity is http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/index.html . I am trying to find out if anyone has cross referenced the dates of high solar activity, the dates of solar storms, and the areas where the magnetic flares have reached the earth. Josh Everyone bringing religion into this is dumb. Truthfully im a christain but seriously science proves more than a bible can prove thats jsut fact. You people say the world wil lend and it doesnt why because all you have is a book backign you up. Thats incredibly outdated. Time to stop believeing in fairytail and start believeing in facts. Ducrider900 Before you call other contributors here dumb, it might behoove you to learn how to spell, and how to string a few cogent words together  its called using grammar to communicate. Too bad its no longer taught in the government schools_you and your pathetic attempt at communication are collectively, exdhibit one of this sad fact.. hippiekarl Whats dumb is calling theories that have become dogmas through nothing more than repetition proofs or facts. Science, painted into a corner by its mutually-contradictory facts, cant even explain such things as why sea-water is salty (the ratio on this planet of sodium to chlorine doesnt allow the oceans current salinity), or why (if iron was always on the surface of the Earth) the Bronze Age preceeded the Iron Age_or why the worlds highest mountains are the youngest, and are coveredbeneath their icewith sea sediment. Science (which gets together and VOTES on what the facts are) is full of hubris but short on the truth, which it periodically changes, changes back, and changes again. Physics is not a democracy, and majority-belief is NOT the benchmark of fact or truth. Max I live in Wisconsin and the local news reports had residents claiming the booms came from the ground, not the sky. Regardless, why do these tremors occur mostly at night? We had a massive chemtrail blitz last Oct and then again late Jan (that we could see) which was very unsettling. So the idea of a sound weapon makes sense somewhat  I think the government is messing with us for not rolling over on the
Bernstein interview with John Pilger November 16, 2016 Americas liberal elitists, who look down on the discontented working class and put up a presidential candidate representing a failed Establishment, set the stage for Donald Trumps victory, journalist John Pilger tells Dennis J Bernstein.By Dennis J Bernstein Despite Donald Trumps long history of stiffing workers, dodging taxes and abusing women, he will become the 45th President of the United States, a remarkable turn of events that has a lot of liberals and Democrats scratching their heads and wondering how he could have beaten the powerful Clinton political/money machine. One person who was not surprised was journalist and filmmaker John Pilger, who was born in Sydney, Australia, and now is based in London. Pilger has reported from all over the world, covering numerous wars, notably Vietnam. When he was in his 20s, he became the youngest journalist to receive Britains highest award for journalism, Journalist of the Year, which he won twice. He also has an Emmy and his most recent book is Hidden Agendas and the New Rulers of the World . Dennis Bernstein: Im going to ask you later on about the new film, which Im very excited about. But lets begin with [the Nov. 8] victory over Clinton, by Trump. Were you surprised? What do you think was at the core of the Trump victory? Journalist John Pilger (Wikipedia) John Pilger: You know, I wasnt surprised. Brexit undoubtedly helped this. I wasnt surprised. I think Im quite surprised by how decisive his victory is. But I must say I felt rather angry, and I think we probably expended enough anger on Trump. Hell, no doubt, provide us with plenty of material coming up. But I think its time for people, so-called liberal people, to look in the mirror. Who created Trump? Who created this disastrous election, so-called campaign? In my opinion the enablers of all of this was the liberal class, in the United States. The liberal class has refused to acknowledge, in its arrogance, the huge disaffection and discontent among ordinary people. And painting them in such broad strokes has been_ what did Clinton call them?_deplorables and irredeemable? Thats really disgraceful. DB: Yes, thats my father. JP: You know, Clinton was an extremely dangerous prospect. Dangerous because she represented a war making, rapacious status quo. The status quo would have, actually, altered slightly under her. Its my understanding, in fact, I believe that she might have provoked a very major war, with Syria and with Russia. We dont know what Trump will do. We have to now, putting aside all the parodies and the abuse, we have to now be thinking in terms of practicalities. Hes running the show. What will he do? But I think before we do that, again, we have to reflect on all the myths. I heard a Harvard professor on the BBC, on the very night, before the count began, talk about the hard left in the Democratic Party, and how she would have to embrace the idea of Bernie Sanders and what he stood for. You know, this kind of drivel, and misrepresentation has been everywhere. The media, personally, and Im speaking of journalists, produced probably the most unfettered propaganda I can remember at any time. In my career, this has been the worst. There was no serious attempt, really, to analyze and examine either candidate and what they stood for. Trump was dismissed as a demon, with all the salacious stuff around him, undoubtedly some of it true, and all of that. But he was a serious candidate, he was never analyzed, and thats why theres a great surprise, and a great shock. And, its something that liberal America has to start coming to terms with itself. We had Barack Obama presented seriously as a candidate of hope and real change. He was nothing of the kind. He was in fact a warmonger. Hes got four wars going at once. He conducted an international terrorist campaign using drones. He has prosecuted more whistleblowers than any president in American history. And, you know, when you think of Trumps disgraceful remarks about throwing people out of the country, and building a wall_ who is the Deporter-in-Chief? The liberal Barack Obama. He has deported more people than any other president. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arresting suspects during a raid in 2010. (Photo Courtesy of ICE) So, all of these facts have been lost and they represent a real crisis for the opposition in the United States, the broad opposition. Barack Obamas great achievement was that he killed off the anti-war movement, because people, doe-eyed from the beginning, thought that Barack Obama was some kind of genuine inspirational liberal, instead of the warmonger that he is. I think theres a lot of these people [who] are going to be listening to your program, they need to hear this. Say that there is a real opposition to Trump and what hes going to do. We dont know what hes going to do, but also an understanding of his constituency, the majority of Americans eligible to vote voted for him. Thats a fact that has to be come to terms with, we have to come to terms with. DB: You know I think, John Pilger, you know Im thinking about all the things Hillary Clinton accused by Trump of, oh, you know, supporting Bill Clintons attacks on women, and molestations. Im not really interested in that, at this point, because what Im interested in is how she sustained Bill Clintons war policy. You remember Layla Al-Attar, right? You remember how Bill Clinton sowed his oats in his first days of his presidency by killing this leading artist of the Middle East who welcomed women into the art world, an unusual situation. It happened in the context of Hillary Clinton giving her famous speech in Beijing about women. But she never mentioned Layla Al-Attar. She never apologized to the family. Laylas daughter was blinded, in that attack. She was getting operations, getting medical treatment near Stanford where the Clintons would go visit Chelsea. And she never said a word. But, anyway, more on that? JP: Yeah, well, thats a very good and rather notorious example. Clintons war making is on the record, her destruction, and she was the lead destroyer of a modern state, Libya. And as a result of that destructionwhich she gloated, on camera, she gloated about the gruesome murder of Gaddafiin that destruction some 40,000 people died. Honduras, she was responsible for the coup against the democratically elected government. DB: They call her there the Deposer-in-Chief. JP: Yeah, yeah. And the idea that among certain liberal people that she represented some kind of honorable alternative to the verbose and unpredictable Donald Trump is so absurd. I think, again, I think all this is important because there will not be an opposition, there wont be an opposition to Trump, and there wont be an opposition to the great national security machine that really runs the United States. I mean, okay, hes anti-establishment, but that establishment isnt going anywhere. And, yes, he will bring in his own establishment. Hes talking about defense secretary. Who is it? Senator Jeff Sessions, a Republican of Alabama. And national security advisors will have a hawkish edge: General Flynn and Representative Duncan Hunter of California, there. So all this is unknown. The point is, there was very little between Trump and Clinton. And what really distracted people, diverted people, from understanding this was what is unfortunately called, because there has to be [_] a better term, identity politics. Clinton was said to represent an advance for women. Shes anything but. Shes a diametric opposite of that. Clinton, the Democrats were meant to be an advance for people of color. Well, it was Clinton, the two Clintons, Bill and Hillary Clinton in the mid-90s, who devised the so-called welfare reforms that most historians, political historians, now agree was the trigger for sending so many African-Americans into the gulag that is Americas prison system. So these, these have to be confronted because an opposition is going to be needed. At the present, there isnt one, in my opinion. There was never an opposition to Barack Obama, a violent president, who seduced the media. Its interesting that the more unpopular or that Donald Trump was made, with the media, and all of them were against him, all of them, bar some Murdock outlets, and others. But most media was against him. I think that helped to give him support. The media is held in such low regard by ordinary people. The so-called elites are held in such low regard by ordinary people. This is a class issue. There was a class issue running right through this campaign. And that has to be understood. DB: Indeed, that word class does not come up in the United States. Were the upwardly mobile society. Everybody can make it. JP: Well, it didnt. But it is, you know, thats what I mean by identity politics. Gender and race are separated from class. And its not who you are, or what the color of your skin is, sometimes it is, perhaps often it is, but in the final analysis its the power you serve. And thats class. And until the resistance to an intelligent understanding of that is swept aside, people are going to be mired in this, the distractions of identity politics. Where they dont feel any obligation, really, to find out. To find out about how the rest of humanity, how the rest of their compatriots in the United States live and what their problems are. Its all about me, me, me. And until that is understood and discarded, discarded, and real feminism returns, not the kind represented by Hillary Clinton, real feminism, to take one major issue, then the Trumps will triumph. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton speaking at Planned Parenthood Action Fund membership event at the Washington Hilton on June 10, 2016. (Photo by Lorie Shaull, Wikipedia) DB: Real feminism? What do you mean by that John, real feminism? JP: Well, I mean feminism that is part of class. The feminism that understands that its not just simply the privileges of bourgeois women. Thats it not simply the privileges of the readers of the New York Times, and the Guardian in this country. It is the rights of women everywhere. It is the right of women to life, in places like Iraq, but are bombed by Americans. I think it was actually the New York Times source for this but one extraordinary statistic I read not long ago, there were 700,000 widows created since 2003. The last 13 years in Iraq, widows, women_ DB: 700,000_ JP: 700,000_ Now until those proclaiming themselves as feminists but keeping their feminism very parochial, very tight, and saying that a woman should be in the White House even if shes Hillary Clinton, I would suggest they consider that fact. Those women have a right too. And those deaths were caused by American policies. And, all Im saying is that the so-called identity, single issues have to stop being single issues. Feminism should be part of class, all the time. Because its poor women who suffer most. And a lot of the people who voted for Trump were those women. I read that, is it 52% of white women voted for him? DB: Something like that, yeah. JP: Well, that has to be understood. Those women have rights too. DB: In a little bit, I want to talk more about the press. Im going to do that with you in the context of Jeff Sessions. Lets talk specifically about one huge foreign policy issue. How do you understand_ were you able to understand the difference between Clinton, Syria, Russia and Trump? You know, we know that the Clinton machine played Trump as a dupe of Putin, in Putins pocket, the Russians sabotaged the election, thats what most people who were supporting Clinton probably now feel that Hillary would have won if the Russians didnt subvert. But the actual policies, what do you understand about that? JP: If they believe that, Dennis, then they suffer from, Ill be gentle, terminal naivet. I really want to say that they are stupid. Because its really stupid to believe that. And its been proven to be stupid: that it was all down to the Russians. I mean, for Gods sake, what nonsense. You know? Those myths_ projected by the media, should be rejected, immediately. We have to learn to deconstruct and reject these propaganda messages that come out. But that one is a particularly obvious one. How could people believe such nonsense? I find that, actually, quite depressing. And Ive heard it from people. How could they believe such nonsense? That the Russians were actually on the side of Trump, he was in league with them, and all of that nonsense. What wasnt reported was there was a strand running through a lot of Trumps speeches that sounded to me like a kind of America first, what they used to call isolationist politics. Were going to deal with our people at home, were not going to spend the treasure on overseas, and especially in going to war with countries. I mean, frankly, for those of us living outside the United States, who are not American, thats encouraging. I always find it remarkable that Ive got to this stage in life and that I havent really_ and that Ive survived American foreign policy. So, Clinton was a very dangerous prospect. Trump may be a dangerous prospect too. We dont know. Will he do as he said, as he said in his acceptance, victory speech? We will have relationships, we will not have conflict with other countries, and all that. That could be just rhetoric. Trump is Mr. Rhetoric, so who knows? I think the most important thing is that an opposition is built, a genuine movement. Now, having been seduced and subverted by Obama, and largely by Clinton and others, there has to be a real oppositions in the streets. And it has to be informed. It cant accept these terrible myths. DB: Hillary Clinton, just to bring it to Syria for a moment, she was very strong on a no-fly zone. And it did appear that Trump was a little more interested in negotiating. What do you see the dangers of a no-fly zone? That, to me, was perhaps the most frightening part of what her policy could have been. JP: I dont know. I mean, he has said contradictory things on the Middle East. Very contradictory. Hes been bellicose, in one sense. But in another, hes been_ a thread that has run through Trumps speeches, fairly consistent, and that is that he wants to do a deal with Russia. He doesnt want to fight them. Its ironic, because, as we speak_ and I read only the other day, hundreds of thousands of NATO troops, Americans, British, and others, in effect, massing on the borders of Russia. Now what will happen to them? What will happen to that provocation? Thats a very, very dangerous provocation. Now, will Trump diffuse it? Will he step back? I dont know. Its interesting, he has spoken against NATO. In fact, for the Republican Convention Platform his people were asked to remove one issue, and that was that NATO would receive renewed shipments of weapons. And they were quite specific about removing that. That was pointed out to me by Professor Steven Cohen, whos been very interesting on this at New York University, and taken a lot of criticism for taking seriously, or at least analyzing some of the things that Trump has said over Russia. But, you know, we never know if he meant it. Hes contradicted himself. So, now were about to find out. DB: Im laughing a little bit because I think Im a little bit afraid of the potential, in terms of where this could go. Im not sure if I would be more frightened if Hillary was elected. A lot of people are furious with me for taking this perspective. But I, as youve outlined, Iraq, Libya_ given the history, you know Honduras, Hillary Clinton, her hands are full of blood. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions donning one of Donald Trumps Make America Great Again caps. JP: Dennis, its an uninformed, and often the_ and often a willfully uninformed and ignorant fury that youre describing. Its a knee-jerk. You know were in the age of the knee-jerk, of social media, knee-jerk, government by Facebook, war by media. Its an anti-intellectual time, not to think through. So the fury you describe, I would suggest, is almost a willfully ignorant one. Because what are we if were not questioning, and what are we, if were not pointing out that which the mob, as they used to call them in the 19 th century, disagrees with? DB: Now, let me sort of put Henry Kissinger and Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, as hes known inside Alabama, together in a question about the media. It was very interesting to me_ I mean I have investigated a number of church burnings, probably 30 or 40 that took place in Alabama when Jeff Sessions was the attorney general. Before that he was the U.S. attorney prosecuting phony voter fraud. But Jefferson Sessions is the pre-eminent racist. I was interested, everybody was upset about David Duke. Well, hes a frightening fellow, former Klan member. But it was Sessions who was the uptown Klan. He was one of the funders, he was one of the prosecutors of the same kinds of stuff that continue in terms of undermining people of colors rights to vote, and poor peoples rights to vote in this country. But the media, they were upset about Duke, but they dont know who Sessions is. JP: No, they dont know. Isnt that interesting? And Sessions is being considered, as I understand it, as Trumps Defense Secretary. DB: Well, for him, anything outside the border of Alabama is foreign policy. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaking to the AIPAC conference in Washington D.C. on March 21, 2016. (Photo credit: AIPAC) JP: Yeah. Now, if thats correct, then [_] how youve described him, of course, its worrying. This is a new situation, entirely new situation. And this is Trump now building a completely new, presidential establishment. But I do stress, that the so-called old establishment, the Pentagon, the intelligence, the NSA, the CIA, and all the rest of them, are going nowhere. They are the establishment. They will remain the establishment. Actually, Trump reminded us, in his acceptance speech that he had something like 200 generals and admirals_ I suppose there must be a lot of generals and admirals, former ones anyway hanging about. But he had 200 of them. Hillary had a lot of them because the Pentagon serving generals and admirals came out and demanded that Trump be beaten. Just as the CIA demanded that Trump be beaten. And the State Department demanded that Trump be beaten. Hes building his own establishment but those_ the old establishment will remain as powerful as its always been. What will give Trump power is the fact that he has both the houses in Congress, including many of his enemies in the Republican Party. And they also demanded that he be beaten. So thats a volatile situation. DB: Indeed it is. What about this? How do you see this sort of parallel structure that people talk about in terms of the relationship_ you mentioned it in the beginning of the interview, between the Brexit vote and Donald Trump? Is this sort of a parallel structure? JP: Yeah, I think its related. And your first question, you know, was I surprised? Yes. Ah, no, I wasnt surprised that much, because of Brexit. I think we are at a stage in contemporary history where people almost feel like a Greek chorus, they can see and they are aware of what is happening, but they feel they cant do anything about it. I think thats widespread. And it doesnt only apply to working people. I think it applies, in the United States, of course, we go back to the issue of class. It certainly does apply to working class people, but it applies to many in the middle class which has been destroyed by these extreme neoliberal economic policies, in recent years. So, thats what happened here, in Brexit. I always felt that Brexit was a rebellion. It was a rebellion. It was people saying, Were fed up with these arrogant elites, taking away our basic rights, ignoring us, not hearing us. And I think many people_it wasnt_ it was painted, of course, by the liberal class in Britain, as the result of a possibility of increased immigration. Yes, that was part of it. But it wasnt_ it was only part of it. (Photo by Luis Felipe Salas, 2009) It was about impoverished people, people losing the very underpinning of their security and the security for their families. And thats exactly true in the United States. You go to places like Kentucky where_ in those ravaged coal areas, where the life expectancy, I read recently is less than that of Ethiopia. Alright, that may be right at the end of the spectrum. But, you know, it applies to all the states that Trump won. Pennsylvania, particularly, Ohio, and others. Yeah, and that applied here in a different sense, but not really. Its about_ its about a rebellion. In the United States, there is a vacuum on outside the establishment. I would say that both Clinton and Trump were extreme right-wing. Thats how I would describe them. DB: Well, it was a riveting moment, I guess you could say, when I think it was in a debate with Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton evoked, as one of her key advisors, Henry Kissinger. JP: Yeah. DB: That was pretty extraordinary, right? JP: Yeah, well, you know as someone who should have been prosecuted a long time ago, has been wrong on practically everything anyway, Im not surprised. She is extreme right-wing. Trump is extreme Populist right-wing. And were still to find out what that means. But my point is, that that, even in the center, in the social democratic space, in the former, going way back, Democratic Party space which now doesnt_ Democratic Party as far as a reforming party is long gone. But that doesnt exist. The United States has never had a Labor Party. Theyve got a Labor Party, weve got a Labor Party here, but thats been corrupted by our very own, although rather different in personality, Clinton-type character, Tony Blair. And all the others. Thats been corrupted. And that_ in Britain, that has given rise to the extraordinary popularity of Jeremy Corbyn, who never wanted to be leader of the Labor Party, but was really swept up in it by a popular movement, that came straight from this disenchantment, this disaffection, this rejection of the political system. The same disaffection and disenchantment is in the United States. But who do people vote for? Who do people vote for? In comes Trump, trumpeting all the American stuff about, you know, Im a rich man, but I got rich because I knew how to do it, and you can too. Speaking this populist language. I dont think Sanders was ever a threat. And really Sanders is a disgrace. You know, his embrace of Clinton was so false some, to the point where Clinton could declare him as an ally. So he was never a threat. He joined, he joined up. DB: That was really troubling, and obviously, a lot of young people who supported Bernie Sanders, were profoundly troubled. And, Ive spoken to some of them, and they are furious, and they didnt show up for Hillary even though they had it drummed into their heads, things like, Even if its just the vote on the Supreme Court, that alone is worth it. The appointment of liberal judges. JP: Yeah. This is grasping for straws, really. And people have got to be, got to stop being disappointed. Theyve got to be stopped being shocked. Stop being surprised. Theyve got to understand why something happened. Theyve got to inform themselves. And theyve got to be part of a real movement, a real oppositional movement. Nothing less than that will do now.   uncomfortably accepting the Nobel Peace Prize from Committee Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland in Oslo, Norway, Dec. 10, 2009. (White House photo) DB: John, youve got a new film thats just coming out now, about to come out. Among other things, its sort of a document that calls attention to the fact that the United States, under Barack Obama, has been engaged in a massive, and very dangerous nuclear buildup. This is in the context of Hillary Clinton being Secretary of State. So would you tell us a little bit about what youve learned about Obama and about the film? JP: Yeah, not only_ well, its about China as a target. At present_ and, Dennis, this is truly shocking, in the northern hemisphere, there is the biggest buildup of U.S. led NATO forces since World War II, confronting Russia. In the Asia-Pacific, there is the biggest buildup of U.S. Naval forces confronting China. This was not an issue. This was not an issue. It is truly something in the election campaign that we just had. And the_ you know, were faced with so much provocation [that] has gone on, and thats what my film is about. It has to do with the Asia-Pacific. But the nuclear issue has returned. Under Obama, nuclear warhead construction and spending increased massively. It increased in spite of Obamas pledge in 2009 to help get rid of nuclear weapons. The opposite happened. Theres something like a trillion dollars has been earmarked to be spent on nuclear weapons development in the coming years. Nuclear_ the whole nuclear issue is so urgent, its so urgent because of this, these provocations against Russia, against China, both of them nuclear armed powers. China has reportedly changed its nuclear weapons policies to first strike, as a direct consequence of this pressure from the United States. Now what will happen to that? Thats such an important question, because war and peace really should be at the top. If a kind of apocalyptic war broke out then all other issues are irrelevant. DB: We see this in the so-called U.S. Pacific Pivot, how dangerous this is getting. Again, because of idiotic U.S. press, all attention is on this so-called maniac in North Korea that we have to do something about. But I think the point here is that weve got another_ when it comes to nuclear proliferation, and weapons, weve got a maniac in the White House. JP: Well, yeah, thats it. And theres always been a maniac in the White House, Im afraid. And thats why I said recently I am always grateful that Im still here, that I havent found myself witnessing my own demise in some nuclear apocalypse, that was the result of U.S. foreign policy. Our understanding of whos the maniac_ I dont think North Korea is a threat, really, to anybody, frankly. What North Korea wants is a peace. They want a peace treaty with the South. They want a peace treaty with the United States. They almost had it a while ago. Thats what they want. And I dont think theyre a threat. But theyre exploited. With their recent test of, I think a nuclear missile, the U.S. has employed, or is about to employ these THAAD missile defense system. These are very aggressive. They got the word defense in there but theyre very aggressive. A Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor is launched during a successful intercept test by the US Army, September 10, 2013. (Wikipedia) DB: And theyre aimed, theyre meant to be aimed, at China. JP: Theyre aimed at China. Theyre not aimed at North Korea, well maybe in the end, North Korea. But North Korea is regarded, really, contemptuously, as an oppositions of power. Theyre aimed at China. And China is being told nowthis is from Clintons speeches, that WikiLeaks releasedaccording to Clinton, you know, the threat against China is that you control North Korea or well let you have some of their missiles, but theyre all aimed at China. And when I was in Okinawa recently, theres no question, 400  500 miles from China, that in the 132 U.S. bases on the island, they were all aimed at China. Now that is a massive, provocative situation. Will Trump dismantle it? Or will he appease it? Or will he use it? These are the questions. DB: These are big questions. And this may seem a little bit silly but I think it makes a lot of sense. In the midst of everybody talking about the crazy person in the north, we learn that Park, the current president, the daughter of the late and bitter dictator of South Korea has been_ one of her key advisors has been a seer. That shes been taking advice from somebody who has been essentially sort of a phony, if you will, a crystal ball reader who has the attention of the president. And so we find out that policy coming out of our allies in the south, with this huge massive military operation happening in Jeju and other places. Shes taking orders_ people made fun of Nancy Reagan. JP: Yeah, well Im not surprised. I mean, South Korea is a colony. Its not an ally. Its an American colony. But its a colony that, as a lot of colonies, can cause you a lot of trouble. The French found that with Algeria. And its got potential for trouble. It could, you know, it could_ it has some very extreme people there, and they could start a war. But it is a colony. It has thirty odd thousand U.S. troops, bases all over it. And as you mentioned, it has this_ the South Koreans have built this new naval base on Jeju Island, with facilities for nuclear submarines, and Aegis missile destroyers and all the rest of it. So_ these places are flashpoints. Theyre flashpoints in_ almost in a war waiting to happen, or in a war that is being beckoned. During the old Cold Warand I think were in the second Cold War nowduring the old Cold War, there were red lines, at least, [that] you didnt cross, there were spheres of influence. And you might probe but you didnt really cross the red lines marked down by the Soviet Union, and_which were mostly in Europe, to protect itself, of course. And the Soviets, although they supported liberation movements in the developing world, did not confront the Americans there. So there were these red lines. There are no red lines now. Thats the difference. Its much more dangerous, now, in my opinion. DB: Well, and, you know, its interesting Im on my way out to North Dakota, at Standing Rock, and where we see the Indigenous communities of North America trying to once again warn the genocidists of the United States government, how dangerous it is to be destroying the Earth, the water flow, not to mention destroying sacred burial grounds. We see, weve got Bull Connor coming back, in the sense that weve got dogs, an incredible, heavily armed force, brutally going after people who are resisting with their bodies, with their buffalo, with their beliefs. And the lines are drawn again. And no major candidate mentioned Standing Rock, I dont think. JP: Yeah. DB: Trump is invested, by the way. Hes invested there. JP: None of these pressing issues were mentioned. Thats why its a very strange time. What is going to happen now? But, again I repeat, I think its time for people to organize. There has to be an independent, an extra-parliamentary, if you like, opposition. An opposition, a movement of the streets, a movement among people having been shamed into silence almost, during the Obama years. People have got to come back now. DB: Its amazing how many smart people can be so stupid. I guess they are well schooled but they dont have any ability to understand foreign politics. I dont know. This country is desperate in that regard. How little the politicians know about the rest of the world. Its incredibly troubling. JP: Yeah, so in one sense its up to us, in the broader sense of us. Not to believe the myths. Not to accept the propaganda, not to retreat in our own introspective worlds of me. But collectively to do something. DB: John, I left upstairs, all the background on your film. Could you remind us the name of the film and whats the schedule in terms of the distribution, and how people can pay attention? JP: Yeah. Well, my new film is called The Coming War on China. And it will be broadcast on the ITV network in Britain, which is the biggest television network in Europe. It will be broadcast here [England] on the 6th of December. It will be released around the same time. As yet, we dont have a distributor in the United States, and its always difficult but were doing work on that. And it really is about the recurring theme in muc
Is Hillary Clinton The Athaliah Of Our Generation? Just Check Out What One Eyewitness Is Saying_   June 6th, 2016 It is amazing to me that the American people would willingly choose an exceedingly wicked woman such as Hillary Clinton to lead them. Perhaps this is just more evidence of how incredibly far we have fallen as a nation. There are many out there that are comparing Hillary Clinton to Queen Jezebel from ancient Israel, but to me there is another figure in the Bible that is much more appropriate. Somewhere around 2800 years ago, King Jehoram of Judah was married to a very wicked woman named Athaliah. When Jehoram unexpectedly died, his son Ahaziah became king of Judah for about a year, but then he died too. At that point Athaliah seized power and tried to kill off all male descendants that might pose a threat to her reign. Fortunately, one very young male descendant did survive, and Athaliah was finally deposed after six horrible years. If you take a close look at the careers of Hillary Clinton and Athaliah, there are definitely some striking parallels between the two_ -They were both initially married to the ruler of the nation. -They both had very prominent roles while their husbands ruled. -They both had an extraordinary lust for power. -They both exhibited extreme paranoia and dealt ruthlessly with anyone that was a potential threat to their hold on power. -Athaliah greatly promoted the worship of Baal in ancient Judah, and one of the key elements of Baal worship was child sacrifice. Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, more than 58 million babies have been murdered in the United States, and Hillary Clinton has spent her entire career telling women that they have a right to choose to kill their children. It would take an entire set of encyclopedias to document all of the evil things that we already know that Hillary Clinton has done, but now disturbing new evidence is coming forward. Former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne is a 29 year veteran of the military and federal law enforcement, and his new book entitled  Crisis of Character  has been the topic of the top headline on the Drudge Report for two days in a row. According to Byrne, Hillary Clinton was so angry and so violent while the Clintons were living in the White House that Secret Service agents and White House staff constantly lived in terror of her next tirade _ What I saw in the 1990s sickened me, he writes in the intro of the book,  Crisis of Character: A White House Secret Service Officer Discloses his Firsthand Experience with Hillary, Bill, and How They Operate . The book claims she repeatedly screamed obscenities at her husband, Secret Service personnel and White House staffers  all of whom lived in terror of her next tirade . In recent years, the media has been absolutely brutal on celebrities that have committed domestic violence, and rightfully so. But why does Hillary Clinton get away with it? According to Byrne, one particularly violent encounter with Hillary resulted in Bill Clinton having a real, live, put-a-steak-on-it black eye _ A former Secret Service officer who helped protect Hillary Clinton while she was in the White House charges in a new tell-all book that the former first lady had a volcanic temper and occasionally got violent with her husband  and that a loud 1995 fight left the president with a black eye . In the book,  Crisis of Character , former agency officer Gary Bryne, details arriving at work after a 1995 shouting-match that left a light blue vase smashed to bits and Bill sporting a real, live, put-a-steak-on-it black eye. Things got so bad that Secret Service agents had discussions about the possibility they might have to protect the president from his wifes physical attacks , the New York Post reported in advance excerpts of the book. Now let me ask you a question_ What should be done to a violent husband that gives his wife a black eye? Of course the answer is obvious. So why wouldnt we treat Hillary Clinton exactly the same way as a society? There are many other extremely interesting details in Byrnes new book, including the fact that he once interrupted Bill Clinton making out with a woman that was not his wife _ Byrne  who was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury that investigated Bill Clintons affair with intern Monica Lewinsky  claims in the book that he interrupted the presidents sexual shenanigans in the White House. Byrne says he walked into a room where the president was involved inappropriately with a woman who was neither his wife nor Lewinsky . These are the people that we want to put back into the White House? Are we completely nuts? There are even more shocking details from the book that I cannot share with you because they are so sordid that they are not appropriate for many of the family friendly websites this article will be appearing on. In the end, I am so glad that Byrne has decided to come forward, because the American people deserve to know the truth about Hillary Clinton. As a former Secret Service agent, he says that there is no way that the Clintons should ever be allowed back into the White House _ Hillary Clinton is now poised to become the Democratic nominee for president of the United States, but she simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve in the office. From the bottom of my soul I know this to be true. So I must speak out. I had no animosity toward the Clintons. Out of a sense of loyalty to our First Family I even secretly disposed of sordid physical evidence that might later have been used to convict the president. The blue dress wasnt the only evidence of his misdeeds. But I could not keep from asking myself how our nations leaders could be so reckless, so volatile, and so dangerous to themselves and to our nation. And yes, to me and my family. I want you to hear my story. Its about the men and women risking their lives to protect this nation. And more important, its about how the Clintons must never again be allowed to put them or you and your childrenat risk. Of course what Byrne is saying meshes very well with what other Secret Service agents have said in the past. Investigative journalist Ron Kessler interviewed many of them for his book entitled The First Family Detail , and he revealed in that book that many agents consider it to be a form of punishment when they are assigned to Hillary Clinton_ However, Hillary is exposed as being the complete opposite of her husband and daughter, and instead is reportedly very rude and acted nasty toward a number of agents. Hillary was very rude to agents, and she didnt appear to like law enforcement or the military, former Secret Service agent Lloyd Bulman recalled to Kessler. She wouldnt go over and meet military people or police officers, as most protectees do. She was just really rude to almost everybody. Shed act like she didnt want you around, like you were beneath her. If we are not going to believe Secret Service agents, who are we going to believe? Over the years, literally dozens of insiders have come forward to tell the truth about the Clintons, and yet the American people continue to embrace them. In the end, we get the leaders that we deserve, and the people that we send to Washington are a reflection of who we are as a nation. So if we send this generations version of Athaliah to the White House in November, what will that say about us? Perhaps that is something that we all should be thinking about in the months ahead_ Was The Gotthard Base Tunnel Opening Ceremony An Illuminati Ritual Intended To Honor Satan?  William Lutz When a woman is attacked by a man, she is the pampered victim of domestic violence who gets special treatment. On the other hand, when a man is attacked by a woman, he is the aggressor who initiated the fight. Thats a perfect example of feminist double standards. Hitlery physically abused her husband and it was swept under the rug. I dont know why certain people such as the Clintons are not held accountable for their actions. theShipIsSinking Two questions:Why are the Clintons (and a long list of others including the Bush Dynasty, Nixon and other conservatives) not held accountable for their actions? Answer: The elite and their puppets are not subjects of the rest of the laws that apply to the most of us. This is why the halls of congress and the White House are filled with lawyers with a few exceptions. From their point of view and the way the laws are written they are people and we are dumb animals to be used as slave labor. Thus the Personal Income Tax. (Implied) Why the double standard against men? Answer: It is part of their sexist war on Men, especially white, heterosexual, conservative men who love the constitution and the Bible. Their religion of Militant Liberalism (supported by both parties) is the apex of Hypocrisy, Hate, Intolerance, and Ignorance. And Oh the homosexual/lesbian/gender queer/gender identity crises agenda/insanity also just is another pawn in their game to destroy the few real Men left along with the concept of our current constitutional Republic based on protecting personal freedoms, privacy, and liberties. Gay Veteran why dont you explain that homosexual/lesbian/gender queer/gender identity crises agenda/insanity theShipIsSinking Not that long ago businesses had the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason. Now we have whores like your friends who demand us bow and worship your idol the phallus. If we refuse service to your abomination called a wedding on the basis of our Biblical faith like good little liberal zombies your friends run to the state and have them file lawsuits against us. Your buddies in the socialist nations (what we are currently becoming) have even pushed the issue to the point of offending them is a crime under hate speech laws (more like outlawing speech they hate) with a prison term because they cannot stand to have your feelings hurt. This is still a constitutional republic. We still have freedom of religion and freedom of speech. We are not about to bow to the religion of Militant Liberalism and nor will we be silent about the apostasy that the reprobate are spreading across this nation. The Original Constitution was based on a very limited federal government and States Rights for a reason. So we could live in the land of freedom and opportunity with the people choosing the way they wish to be governed, Now we are at the whims of special interest groups and indoctrination systems (de-education and the media) desiring to stomp on the rights of the majority in the name of their idols called Diversity on a national level with a joke for representation. Dont worry, go vote for that whore Hitlery Clinton and she will be happy to give you a job exterminating any who refuses to worship the liberal agenda and her ideas for the new america where the original constitution For the United States ratified in 1788 is no more. Yes, that same constitution you swore to uphold. We have a Domestic Terrorist Enemy sitting in the WH and one running for the office of presidency and nobody is doing much at all. Do we need to call out the Oathkeepers to protect our citizen when going to political rallies such as in San Jose? I thank you for your service and I will remind you that the commies who seek the highest position in the land will not be so accepting of you if you are of a conservative mindset. Gay Veteran Not that long ago businesses had the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason_. yeah, the days of Jim Crow _Now we have whores like your friends who demand us bow and worship your idol the phallus_. what about lesbians, moron _If we refuse service to your abomination called a wedding on the basis of our Biblical faith like good little liberal zombies your friends run to the state and have them file lawsuits against us_.. how about the baker who oppose interracial marriages because of their Biblical faith? but I tell you what, simple solution: NO lawsuits but you put a sign in your store window saying we do not serve . truth in advertising, you know _Your buddies in the socialist nations (what we are currently becoming) have even pushed the issue to the point of offending them is a crime under hate speech laws (more like outlawing speech they hate) with a prison term because they cannot stand to have your feelings hurt._ I have no buddies in socialist nations, and fully support the Bill of Rights. _Now we are at the whims of special interest groups_. poor thing, I bet you miss saying ni**er too _Dont worry, go vote for that whore Hitlery Clinton_. shows what a moron you are by assuming I would vote for Killery, the war-mongering neo-con psychopath _Do we need to call out the Oathkeepers to protect our citizen when going to political rallies such as in San Jose?_. probably IF the police dont do the job theyre PAID to do _I thank you for your service_. then you are a fool, I was a mere cog in the imperial war machine. STOP worshiping the military!!! Rastus I was a mere cog in the imperial war machine. Then change your user name veteran if your not proud of your service. I was a veteran like some that post here but we dont broadcast it like you deviants like to. theShipIsSinking Liberalism (endorsed by both parties) is the apex of Hypocrisy, Hate, Intolerance and Ignorance. Thank you for your post and your service. Gay Veteran well junior, like Im going to ask your permission for my screen name  faggots krinks Watch Last Week Tonight with John Oliver for the answers. At no way, no how are Democrats ever held accountable for anything. He may mention a few irrelevant congressional or state Dems but that is it. Obama never, Hillary never. This is standard procedure for the majority of media outlets. This why for an alternative opinion we are stuck with Talk Radio, whom ill never forgive for all the hate they gave The Donald. Most people dont have the intellectual wherewithal to seek another opinion to ensure what they see/read is not slanted/a lie. Hence people are pushed a certain direction and willingly go. iris I think were plenty intelligent enough, but have been duped through social engineering via: Public schools are actually discouraging critical thinking, questioning, independence, in favor of blind acceptance and a herd mentality. Even many Christian churches are teaching this, often, unwittingly. The MSM also reinforces this daily inundation. Also, escapism is rampant in our society. Its much easier to seek entertainment after a long days work, or a long day of no job at all, and the longer that habit is entrenched, the harder it is to break free from it. Not saying that enjoying life is bad, its very good, but so often, the acceptable forms of seeking thrills are destructive ones, in our culture. At the end of the day, we are each accountable for our lives, however. We cant blame everything on the forces at work, whether its local or global. We can receive freedom, meaning, joy and empowerment in God. Its a whole different paradigm. Rastus We are in a spiritual war that even most Christians do not understand. The powers, principalities and forces of darkness are on a full frontal attack. Get your spiritual house in order! theShipIsSinking Yes, and none of us knows when our time might be up! William Lutz Well many Republicans are never held accountable for anything either. That is why I hate both parties. Both consist of greedy crony politicians who care about wealth and power, not us. They are not in office to serve the interests of ordinary Americans. Furthermore, the two party system is outdated; weve had it for too long. Dont you think its time to abolish it? Thats why Im choosing a third party candidate this year. krinks PLEASE! When a scandal hits youd swear the Purps first name was Republican.

The Clintons are just another sample of that along with the Bush dynasty, Obamacare, nation building, living on credit and debt etc. There is no end to what people will accept; at least enough people to put people into power. Here we go again. iris Yes. The kingdoms of this world will never change, until Christs return. And our votes may be getting hijacked, so we need to continue as individuals to look to God and do good, as He empowers us. Jodie Lynn Gaeta I couldnt care less about what some tell-all book says about Hillary. Her stance on Obamacare, illegal immigration, education, civil liberties, etc. is enough to have convinced me not to vote for her. iris Agree. I dont think shes competent. Letfreedomring Anyone else notice Hillary became the democratic nominee on 6/6/16 by winning California where the Satanists had a huge celebration today? loadnup Yup_ D-Day all over again with a different twist,_ watchmannonthewall Michael, youve made a very appropriate connection between Athaliah and Hillary. Both Jezebel and Athaliah were in power when the nations of Israel and Judah were in apostasy! Isaiah writes that God gives women to lead and children to oppress us when He judges us. (Is. 3:12) Hillarys history is one of stonewalling, deception, lies, false accusations, division, in-your-face, and you can fill in all the others. Ive been getting updates from Judicial Watch for years on her activities and distain for our system of government and laws! Whether she is elected or not, no doubt the fact she is where she is confirms how far the moral standards of the nation have fallen since Gary Hart dropped out of the presidential race after the affair he had with Donna Rice became known in 1987. Less than 10 years later the people of the nation didnt give a rip about what extracurricular activities went on in the Oval Office, as long as the economy kept humming, and now many support evil Hillary! I would say God help us, but I dont think He is listening anymore, unless we say the right things! Abe You said a mouth full!! I just got a 60 page packet from Judicial Watch from stuff 3 months ago to get us where were at today. Its not looking good for Broomhildary!I But shes made of teflon! Hopefully like Gotti and this will be her end! I hope the people are awake! Or at least enough of them. The late 50s to early 70s was pure hell! I hoped never to go through that again. I can see it rearing its ugly head on the horizon, but will be worse because will have a total financial collapse along with it. get a clue The Bilderbergers pick who the next puppet is. The people of the nation dont get what they want because were slaves to BANKERS! Shabaz101 Hey guys lets say you preferred Sanders over Hilary, now Hilary bags nomination, who is lesser evil as compared to the Deranged DJ Trump and his volatile unpredictable nature. loadnup You would be well served to listen to his presentation on international affairs_. he is not unpredictable. He is real and he says what we folks here in the daily trenches are seeing, feeling, living through. The man has done multiple acts of kindness for folks from vets, people who have lost their homes to other folks in need of expensive medical services. That tells me that his heart is in the right place as he never sought recognition for these hidden acts of mercy_ iris VOTE TRUMP Put The Benghazi Murderer In Jail !. afchief Is Hillary a democrat? Then she is a compulsive liar. greanfinisher . Whatever she is, I hope its not contagious. watchmannonthewall It is! Evil is very contgious! Many men do not want to discipline themselves. That is why so many voted for her and support her. And the media loves her! You know what little truth they tell the American public. Again, like mind joins to like kind! The broadness and depth of her support is clear evidence, to me, the nation is lost. There was a chance to right the ship 20 years ago if the leaders and public had insisted on integrity in the presidency, as they should have. Not now! Gay Veteran just like any republican politician Patrick Grimes Comparing Hillary to Athaliah or Jezebel are both good fits. Both were murderous psychopaths and both had an insatable lust for power. I dont see how anyone in their right mind could vote for this demonically controlled woman. In my view only those who are mentally challenged or mentally deranged or both would consider such a candidate. Rastus Try demonically influenced or inhabited. It will make more sense. greanfinisher . She was just really rude to almost everybody. Shed act like she didnt want you around, like you were beneath her. That would fit the description of any aristocrat. After all, members of the oligarchy typically are rude, arrogant and do not associate with commoners. greanfinisher . Best to simply sit out this rubber-stamped election. loadnup Ah, thats a big NO_. by sitting out the election you are implying that you think hitlery and all her evil should be running this country_. no matter how much you may hate the establishment you are duty bound to vote, that is, make your tiny voice heard even if for just that one instant in time to say No more to the festering evil around us.. watchmannonthewall Sort of like Horton Hears a Who! That one little voice may make all the difference! greanfinisher . I have no duty whatsoever to vote in a rigged election (or should I say purchased?). All that I would be simply doing here is applying a rubber stamp on a candidate who was already pre-screened by the partys political bosses. By the way, Im hardly supporting the gun confiscatin Killary horror. Bill G Wilminton NC Its a lost cause as his own party is backing the gun confiscatin racketeer. greanfinisher . I think that a vote for either of those two clowns would be wrong. In fact, I would even go on to say that the Republican base is just as dissatisfied with Trump as the Democratic base is with Clinton. Why would the Democrats want to elect a tyrant who would simply send more jobs to third world sweat shops, confiscate all firearms, tax the daylights out of the middle class, impose martial law, launch more wars, increase the national debt even further and create more havoc in the land? Dont blame the Democrats as they didnt ask for that lyin witch. Of course, the Republicans have their own issues with Trump as well. JB I thought the parallels to Athaliah in 2 Kings was interesting. Again, theres nothing new under the sun. A lot of folks are putting their trust in Donald Trump, but if the Lords hand is indeed involved in this and we (as a nation) are being judged, she may very well end up becoming our next leader; one cant go against the will of God. Its horrifying to read even a smidgeon of what she may have said and done in the past, yet the church continues to walk in the flesh, seemingly more interested in building larger buildings, generating funds, social programs, welcoming committees and welcoming non Christians into their congregations, embracing false teachers and false doctrines  in a word, a climate of apostacy, just as it was in Judah under King Jehoram. The only way out of this is if my people (the church) repents, seeks His face, chooses to walk in the Spirit, and seeks revival/ times of refreshing  and leaves it up to the Lord to heal their land. iris I hope by your saying welcoming non Christians into congregations, youre referring to membership. Many people who stumble into churches, being afraid, confused, or truly seeking God, hear the gospel there, and find new life in Christ Jesus. But I so agree, if you meant membership. There are plenty of Christian pastors and priests in certain denominations, which have stated that they either dont believe in God, or that their belief system is so inclusive as to deny the efficacy of Christs finished work on the Cross as the only way of salvation. This is an aside, but   licentiousness and legalism are the two sides of one coin. Rastus Please, briefly explain your aside. iris Well, heres an example. After coming to faith in college, I stumbled into a church which believed the whole Bible was inspired, and the final authority, which I was glad to hear, (and still believe) and got immediately involved. 3 years into that denomination, and in one of their Bible colleges, I realized that they were almost completely legalistic, and that this was definitely not how I first knew Jesus Christ. I left church altogether for a few years, (not Jesus, but was leery of church at that point). God helped me through that time, and I started going back to church, but never that denomination again. It has been 35? years since I had dealings with it, but in reading about them now, one would never recognize them, as they have changed their positions on several major fronts, but again, from a man-centered perspective, and now are quite liberal in certain areas, and not in a good way. I think this change has been about money and church growth. I dont think legalists realize their hypocrisy, and usually mean well, but its grace + nothing, for me. He who began a good work in me will be faithful to complete it until the day of the Lord Jesus, Philippians 1:6. My hope is in Him, and not in myself. The more I walk that way, the same way i was walking in Christ at first, the more joy, peace, love and righteousness come from my life. But the opposite happens when I revert back to the old nature of earning, proving, appearances, etc., and the ways and things of the world seem to present a stronger temptation for me. I think the move towards practicing contemplative meditation, also known as holy yoga in Christian circles, might be an expected outcome for someone who has subscribed to the grace + works doctrines. Imo, that is another work, according to what Ive heard some of them say. They are trying to grow spiritually, get closer to God through this practice, rather than resting in faith in Christ alone, and His finished work on the Cross. iris Theres a good book on the subject of spiritual abuse, by Jeff VanVonderen, a Christian counselor and former pastor. The Subtle Power of Spiritual Abuse. Hes also written other books, one on breaking free from substance addiction, and is a recovered addict, himself. He has a lot of humor, humility and logic and is good about showing the contrast between grace and faith vs works and sin.   as we walk in faith, we will be keeping the Law, but that it cant happen the other way around. God bless, and thanks for asking! loadnup Just as it was in the days of Noah, so also will it be in the days of the Son of Man. Between the truth that Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear, and the throngs clambering for more bread and circus who have nothing to do with any organized religion (not that all those who attend church have an abiding faith in the one Triune God) we are surrounded by the abomination of a kind of desolation that brings destruction to our very doors_. pray, prep and protect. carson if their putting their trust in don trump_then jeremiah 17:5_?_.!! watchmannonthewall Great verse! One of my favorites. Wish many Christians would consider the message. A parallel verse is Hosea 5:11. Both say the same thing, but in different words! carson yeah I wish they would too. Gods word is a lamp to the feet the light to the path_but instead many would rather listen to what men say. watchmannonthewall I recently read somewhere that spending on religious construction was up nearly 10%. I believe it was from year ago figures but possibly just in the last month. Nonetheless, I thought it rather interesting considering all of the confusion about the economy. chriscas And the witch just clinched the nomination! I guess Im going to have to roll the dice on Trump this November_. loadnup I dont even consider it rolling the dice. The whore/horror that she is is so revolting to me that when I accidently see a picture of her the satanic refection on her face nauseates me to the point of guttural revolt_ anyway, the Donald is who I will be voting for and promoting to any with ears to hear. Pray, prep and protect. Bill G Wilminton NC Vote Trump send the Hildebeast to Jail !. Gay Veteran oh Bill, youll end up as disappointed as the few Obama voters who finally woke up! NO one who would actually threaten TPTB gets to the top of the political heap in AmeriKa Bill G Wilminton NC TPTB thru main stream media have been attacking Trump since he began the Repub primary race. But something happened the people love what he SAYS and figured out that Trump speaks for We the People TPTB are still attacking Trump that makes me believe that Trump is for real or maybe in a different faction of TPTB. _.his plans are definitely not NWO congruent and the  repub establishment are crapping in their pants_.ha ha what a show My belief is that Trump is for real and the 60 million disenfranchised voters that did not vote in the last election are going to landslide Trump over Hillary_.LANDSLIDE. Vote Trump the fact that Trump is alive shows that TPTB do not fear him Bill G Wilminton NC They TPTB believed that we are all sheeple forever_..and when Trump first came on the scene just laughed_.but the sheeple are pissed, mad, angry, and not taking it anymore and exhuberantly supporting Trump I pray for the safety of Mr Trump !. A.S. Now it makes perfect sense why Bill had so many mistresses. He was NOT getting any love and attention at home, from his own wife, so why not look elsewhere to fill the void. greanfinisher . That racketeerin wench even makes the Wicked Witch of the West seem adorable by comparison. RageHard84 You could be right. DJohn1 I seldom see you commit yourself anymore when it comes to politics. That is what makes this article so unusual. I changed political parties this election. I have been in the past a Democrat. No more. I guess the major question will be who is likely to do the least amount of damage if elected. So far Donald Trump may be the person who will do the least amount of damage though not by much. Hillary will lead us right into world war III if I am right. Bernie is likely to bankrupt what is left of this country with socialism. Trump might actually straighten up and fly right with the team he puts together. Then there is the great unknown. Meaning the people that become vice presidents. Never forget we are one heart beat away from that person taking office. I think I would look real close this election to whomever is appointed as the vice candidate. I think what scares people the most is the archie bunkerisms that Donald has spouted. We are at the end of an age. The new age being born will happen in January. Remember one thing. Donald Trump has accomplished more with less money than any candidate in history. That is a form of genius. I have been in voted office before. I was one of the most successful people at it that there was in a very small pond. The only reason I succeeded was I was dead honest about everything. I prayed a lot. Secretly for the most part. I wasnt ashamed. I simply followed scripture. The other reason was the good Lord showed me what to do. He helped me pick a really good team to back me up. And that is what I hope Donald will do.

It Is Mathematically Impossible To Pay Off All Of Our Debt   May 21st, 2015 Did you know that if you took every single penny away from everyone in the United States that it still would not be enough to pay off the national debt? Today, the debt of   exceeds $145,000 per household, and it is getting worse with each passing year. Many believe that if we paid it off a little bit at a time that we could eventually pay it all off, but as you will see below that isnt going to work either. It has been projected that mandatory federal spending on programs such as Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare plus interest on the national debt will exceed total federal revenue by the year 2025. That is before a single dollar is spent on the U.S. military, homeland security, paying federal workers or building any roads and bridges. So no, we arent going to be paying down our debt any time in the foreseeable future. And of course it isnt just our 18 trillion dollar national debt that we need to be concerned about. Overall, Americans are a total of 58 trillion dollars in debt. 35 years ago, that number was sitting at just 4.3 trillion dollars. There is no way in the world that all of that debt can ever be repaid. The only thing that we can hope for now is for this debt bubble to last   before it finally explodes. It shocks many people to learn that our debt is far larger than the total amount of money in existence. So lets take a few moments and go through some of the numbers. When most people think of money, they think of coins, paper money and checking accounts. All of those are contained in one of the most basic measures of money known as M1 . The following definition of M1 comes from Investopedia _ A measure of the money supply that includes all physical money, such as coins and currency, as well as demand deposits, checking accounts and Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts. M1 measures the most liquid components of the money supply, as it contains cash and assets that can quickly be converted to currency. As you can see from the chart below, M1 has really grown in recent years thanks to rampant quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. At the moment it is sitting just shy of 3 trillion dollars_ So if you gathered up all coins, all paper currency and all money in everyones checking accounts, would that even make much of a dent in our debt? Well have to find more money to grab. M2 is a broader definition of money than M1 is, because it includes more things. The following definition of M2 comes from Investopedia _ As you can see from the chart below, M2 is sitting just short of 12 trillion dollars right now_ That is a lot more money, but it still wouldnt pay off our national debt, much less our total debt of 58 trillion dollars. So is there anything else that we could grab? Well, the broadest definition of money that is commonly used is M3 . The following definition of M3 comes from Investopedia _ A measure of money supply that includes M2 as well as large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements and other larger liquid assets. The M3 measurement includes assets that are less liquid than other components of the money supply, and are more closely related to the finances of larger financial institutions and corporations than to those of businesses and individuals. These types of assets are referred to as near, near money. The Federal Reserve no longer provides charts for M3, but according to John Williams of shadowstats.com , M3 is currently sitting somewhere in the neighborhood of 17 trillion dollars. So even with the broadest possible definition of money, we simply cannot come up with enough to pay off the debt of  , much less the rest of our debts. That is not good news at all. Alternatively, could we just start spending less than we bring in and start paying down the national debt a little bit at a time? Perhaps that may have been true at one time, but now we are really up against a wall. Our rapidly aging population is going to put an enormous amount of stress on our national finances in the years ahead. According to U.S. Representative Frank Wolf , interest on the national debt plus mandatory spending on programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will surpass the total amount of federal revenue by the year 2025. That is before a single penny is spent on homeland security, national defense, paying federal workers, etc. But even now things are a giant mess. We are told that deficits are under control, but that is a massive hoax that is based on accounting gimmicks. During fiscal year 2014, the U.S. national debt increased by more than a trillion dollars . That is not under control that is a raging national crisis. Many believe that that we could improve the situation by raising taxes. And yes, a little bit more could probably be squeezed out of us, but the impact on government finances would be negligible. Since the end of World War II, the amount of tax revenue taken in by   has fluctuated in a range between 15 and 20 percent of GDP no matter what tax rates have been. I believe that it is possible to get up into the low twenties, but that would also be very damaging to our economy and the American public would probably throw a huge temper tantrum. The real problem, of course, is our out of control spending. During the past two decades, spending by   has grown 63 percent more rapidly than inflation, and mandatory spending on programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid has actually doubled after you adjust for inflation. We simply cannot afford to keep spending money like this. And then there is the matter of interest on the national debt. For the moment, the rest of the world is lending us gigantic mountains of money at ridiculously low interest rates. However, if the average rate of interest on U.S. government debt was just to return to the long-term average, we would be spending more than a trillion dollars a year just in interest on the national debt. So the best possible environment for paying down our debt that we are ever going to see is happening right now. The only place that interest rates on U.S. government debt have to go is up, and our population is going to just keep getting older and more dependent on government programs. Meanwhile, our overall debt continues to spiral out of control as well. According to CNBC , the total amount of debt that Americans owe has reached a staggering 58.7 trillion dollars_ As the nation entered the 1980s, there was comparatively little debtjust about $4.3 trillion. That was only about 1.5 times the size of gross GDP. Then a funny thing happened. The gap began to widen during the decade, and then became basically parabolic through the 90s and into the early part of the 21st century. Though debt took a brief decline in 2009 as the country limped its way out of the financial crisis, it has climbed again and is now, at $58.7 trillion, 3.3 times the size of GDP and about 13 times what it was in 1980, according to data from the Federal Reserves St. Louis branch. (The total debt measure is not to be confused with the $18.2 trillion national debt, which is 102 percent of GDP and is a subset of the total figure.) As I discussed above, there isnt enough money in our entire system to even pay off a significant chunk of that debt. So what happens when the total amount of debt in a society vastly exceeds the total amount of money? Is there any way out other than collapse?

SunnyFlaSnotress You know other countries owe us money too This is a very one-sided, biased article. fortunato Not my problem and I dont care how much money our government racks up in debt. After all what can we the people do about it? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. This problem will never end and the debt will only grow larger and larger. All governments all over the world are the same way. State and local too. If the majority of people started doing the underhanded things that the elites do I can guarantee you that the scales would tip back in our favor not theirs. They did a study on the human brain and it showed that the more money a person has the greedier and self centered they became. Google it to read the article. df NJ Youve probably heard that power corrupts. I read in a psychology book an idea called the metamorphic effect of power. The idea is whenever someone successfully influences another person it changes the powerholders psyche. We the powerholder develops a contempt for the person they perceive they have power over. The greater the power the more contempt. Eventually the powerholder thinks the people under their influence as non-human being insects who can be killed or squashed without any moral consequence. gts58 Youve just described Obama perfectly! Cannonfodder2010 He described EVERY politician perfectly. Donald Trump would take it to a much higher level. none Thank God President Obama has been taking his multi-million dollar vacations. At taxpayer expense. It will not cost the taxpayers anything! Since they cannot pay it back. And with all the money that he has and will make from his investments in the stock market. Along with his pension and other investments he should end up doing very well. goldfinger Not only that but we the people also fund the generous pension and health insurance plan that congress choose for themselves. Heck even in congress if you get convicted of a crime you never lose your pension or health benefits. Isnt American wonderful? Thomas Keith It will not cost the taxpayers anything! Since they cannot pay it back. First, you need an English lesson, since you obviously dont know the difference between a clause and a sentence. That aside, yes, there will be payment in the form of a deeper, longer depression. _aleph_ Nemnor fortunato, you stated _After all what can we the people do about it? Nothing. Absolutely nothing_. Actually, Governments do as they do, as long as the mass of the people let it be. As long as the people do not have the will and the courage to demand the change they want. However, people are kept under control by using various means to divide and distract them. The major Media Networks and the Educational system are the two main non-violent arm the Ruling Class use to control the masses. AND, where the non-violent arm fail, then the violent arm (i.e. the Army and Police) is used accordingly. So it takes UNITY and a lot of COURAGE for the masses to have the change we want, and we CAN do something, but it begins with having the WILL to do what we wish to do.. Dont forget the corporate toxic food chain which leads to the mass addiction to pharma mafia given the dis-ease/obesity epidemic that fuels medical costs_.everything IS connected to dummy down the masses. gts58 Your second paragraph says it all. Thomas Keith You dont care how much debt your government racks up? Fool, its you and the rest of the citizenry who the world will look to for repayment. The world honors the USs request for more credit (for no. at least) because of the US governments ability to tax its peoples. Keeping your head in the sand wont save you. _aleph_ Catman This is why the politicians have no plan to do deal with the national debt: it cannot be fixed. They already know what you so well explain. The economies of the world depend on more debt through fractional reserve banking and treasury bond purchases to create more money to pay the interest and keep from sliding into a depression. This will not end with a fiscal policy. There is no brake on this rig. I recently had a dream where I was driving a car on which the brakes did not work. Very frustrating. Well, I have no debt, but perhaps it speaks to the sense of being carried along with little recourse other than to just keep the car in the middle of the road and try not to hit anything or anyone. I think a lot of us feel like that in life: we have no control, we cant get off the roller coaster, and one way or the other were all in this together.

Mike Whose the tribal 5th column? jsmith Are you playing coy or just being ignorant? Im sure someone will enlighten you. Nemnor df NJ, a _small group of sadist European bankers _ (as you put it) are only a symptom of a much wider and more fundamental cause of the issues facing the USA. The main root cause of the worsening socioeconomic issues in the USA (and the World), is  the Capitalist system itself  which has became decadent, is at a dead end and is NOT able to generate long-term recovery by economic means alone . The world-wide Capitalist system became decadent as it reached a level of general over-production . With over-production, it became harder and harder for the Capitalist to sell their products/services, for even what the Capitalist consider a reasonable profit. Hence, the reason the Capitalists (irrationally) engage more and more in Share Repurchase/Stock Buyback (to ARTIFICIALLY raise the value of a companys stock), and/or invest in financial bubbles, derivatives and other exotic financial instruments ( even lend money to people that are not credit worthy ), and with many of these investments having little or not relations to the real economy!!! There is NO going back to the good ole days of the USA, or going back to real/pure/free market Capitalism , because Capitalist USA already passed its progressive stage and is now at a dead end. The real solution can only be with a fundamental change away from Capitalism , as no amount of reforms could ever fix Capitalist USA. HeyAHuman This has been an economic system built upon debt since the creation of the Federal Reserve. It would have been easily known beforehand that this would burst and cause chaos. Why has it been allowed for so long? Insane. Bill Same reason we have an imposter in the White House. We the sheeple do not have the fortunes needed in order to run for an office that would allow us to make a difference. Voting is too manipulated to make a difference. Robots are the future of sheeple who dont require daily feeding. Bob332 This country is now officially in the toilet. Will the last person to flush, please turn off the bathroom light. nekksys Just have the attendant do it as you flip him your last coin_ Christoph Weise We have long passed the point at which repayment of debt could have been possible. Maybe it was never possible. I have heard that there is always more debt in the system than money to repay it. That is the nature of the fractional reserve system. Central banks world wide have decided 2009 not to bother about racking up debt. They are printing money and providing it to financial institutions as needed. We have now two different circulation systems. One is the old system. It comprises of individuals and corporations. The traditional debt limits apply. Bankruptcy and insolvency are possible. Than we have the newly created second circulation system. It comprises of central banks and systematically important lenders. These organisations can not bankrupt or become insolvent. They have escaped from the ordinary circulation system and are eternal. De facto we are faced now with a two class system. This is the departure from market economy. And it is problematic in many aspects. Some of them: (1) The change to our system has never been properly explained and is kept as a secret (2) The political bodies never made a decision on this change (and thus it is illegal and because of its illegality central banks are engaged in criminal activity) (3) Before the law all people should be equal. This principle is violated by the introduction of the principle of eternal economic life and could only be trumped by the introduction of eternal biological life for a limited set of individuals. The question arises if the second circulation system is indeed eternal. There may be limits but I never saw a comprehensive discussion of the topic. I presume it would take a single global currency to avoid a systemic default. But I am not sure. It looks like the can kicking strategy has a very long life. GSOB I presume it would take a single global currency to avoid a systemic default.  Me too. JailBanksters Ironically, Every dollar in your Wallet had to be loaned into existence for you to have it, it represents Debt not Wealth and it belongs to the Banking Cartel. You could take that dollar back to the Club FED to extinguish that loan, but you have to pay the Interest on that Dollar. Where do you get the Money from to pay back the Interest on that Dollar, the Club FED of Course. And then youd have to pay the Interest on that as well. By all definitions of a Ponzi Scheme, the Club FED is a Ponzi Scheme where you pay one debt by creating another debt to infinity. This ensures that nobody can never own more than the Banking Cartel. Its an absolute brilliant scam, and its been going on for 100 years, with one re-invention for Gold-Standard and another time for Credit Cards to overcome the 45 year limit on Fiat Money. Richard I cant help wanting to thank you, Michael, for adjusting the manner of your prose in recent posts. They have become a joy to read. You seem to have removed all the cliches and annoying repartee. Maybe nobody else appreciates this but I can only express own, continued appreciation for the New You! Thank you. Didnt you write this before? nobody Actually Michael is wrong: its perfectly possible to pay off the entire debt in less than 5 years. All they need to do is to cut all welfare and military funds and eliminate all tax discounts. But that will never happen. nekksys This idea doesnt account for paying off PERSONAL debt as opposed to GOVERNMENT debt. And, as someone already pointed out, when the first $11T is paid back, the money it represents disappears, therefore a vast amount of the M1 will vanish into thin air leaving only the hard currency which can not be distributed sufficiently throughout the population to effect an further debt payments. In other words, no matter how you slice it, were all pretty much Fd in the A thanks to the recklessness of our government and the banksters. nobody So a bunch of banks will go under  more power to the big ones, you lose, they win. Actually it wont disappear since it has never existed to begin with and it will just be created elsewhere. BTW your hard currency has stopped having any power a long time ago, now its just a bunch of paper and its worth only what the issuing bank says its worth. And no, gold by itself isnt worth anything since it can be taken from you at the whim of the government. nekksys Hard Currency = Paper and Coin_ I wasnt referencing buying power either. I was referring to the ACTUAL M1. Please try to keep up. nobody Actually thats incorrect: a hard currency is a means of payment (usually a currency but it can also be a commodity) that is well and widely trusted and used for savings. Also called safe-heaven currency. Please use the correct terms from now on. nekksys Typical_ When folks like yourself start losing the debate, you shift and try to muddy the waters. Nice try, though! Considering your previous statement BTW your hard currency has stopped having any power a long time ago in light of your most recent redefinition of hard currency, I guess that means all commodities in my possession are worthless as well? Last I checked, a pound of iron was still a pound of iron and still possesses the same value. Again, the M1 was what I was referencing. The M1 is the actual, hard currency in circulation. M1 doesnt consider commodities as part of the equation. Please, if you choose to redefine something, make sure you havent used the same term previously_ And do keep up with the conversation. nobody No, a pound of iron is an asset, that has its own value. No, M1 isnt a representation of hard currency, its just an index detailing the total amount of money in an economy  which includes absolutely everything, even those that exist only as electronic vapour. Please try to keep up, or at least get a basic economy/banking course at your local free college. nekksys Awww_ Look! It can read (a little)_ Again, judging by the current value of the M1, theres no way it includes everything you claim. Furthermore, you are still forgetting that once debt is repaid, ALL the currency it represents (whether real or electronic vapour) vanishes. Once the repayment process is underway, the available currency supply continues to diminish eventually leading to a ZERO currency state WITH remaining debt_ nobody And you know theres no way because a little birdy told you so, right? Lets be real, M1 is a government decided value and you will never have a say on it. Wrong again, it doesnt disappear, it goes into the banks accounts as an asset, which is in turn used to create even more money by lending it/investing it at least twice its value. The problem appears when they no longer have legit ways to invest it so they invent things like the derivatives to absorb the surplus of money they have created. Yes you can, you can claim it will be used to make 1000 knives and sell derivatives on that in excess of $1k on it. For everybody that $1 lump of iron will now be worth $1k  and this procedure is entirely legal and legit. Were not talking about honesty here, remember. alan Where are those trillion dollar coins they had about two years ago? Mint a couple hundred of them and were good. XSANDIEGOCA As long as we refuse to return to the Gold Standard, we shall continue to suffer. China understands this implicitly. All they have to do to drop us without firing a shot is to just threaten to tie the Yuan to Gold. Game Over. (BTW, the interest on our debt to China underwrites their entire Defense Budget!) Today the $20 bill is the equivalent to the $5 bill of my youth. Now there is serious talk of replacing the visage of Andrew Jackson, the man who saved America in the War of 1812, on that bill with a Slave. How utterly appropriate. Genada Andrew Jackson would despise the idea of being on a bank note and especially of the modern day version of the one he destroyed. Fun fact about Jackson: Only president EVER to retire the national debt. XSANDIEGOCA Dwain Dibley Back when Andrew Jackson was the president Gold was the money, somewhat hard to come by and it would be reasonable to assume a national debt. Today the money is Fiat, and all they have to do is print it. How can a government that can print the money to pay its bills, ever get into debt? And, what is it borrowing and what does it owe? This whole government debt thing seems kind of fishy to me_.. Tranqual He killed the central bank and said it was his most important accomplishment. Then the bankers crashed the economy and blamed him. jsmith You seem to have connected the dots X, however you are probably very young because Id like to think of the $20.00 bill as the new $1.00 bill. Back in 1963 whe I was 14, I could go to downtown Lost Angeles by bus to the movies, and see 3 matinee flics including milk duds and still have money left over from the 4 silver quarters my mom gave me! And yes, how appropriate that you noticed Andy Jackson being replaced by a slave. Why, Andies greatest quote is that he killed the bank and is one of Americas greatest heroes! And to quote Michaels The real problem, of course, is our out of control spending yet we have one of our greatest termites in the form of John McCain and the others who want to increase defense spending because the Russians and primarily the Chinese are building up their defense spending, with our money. Insane. I was kind of hoping for a gradual collapse due mainly to money printing and inflation, but Im afraid things are speeding up as the symptoms of impending crisis are being overlooked and exacerbated by our moronic president and termitic Congress. Either they are puppet fools, or part of the conspiracy to destroy our country. America is kaput! XSANDIEGOCA Ah, those were the daze! Actually, you are right. In my mind todays 20 was yesterdays 5. Anyway, too many disturbances in the Force. One good shove will do it, send the boulder crashing down the hill. Pick your scenario. Another terrorist attack. China moving on Taiwan. Iran heaving one into Israel. Then it will be look out below! Zenithon And still if I pull out a $100 bill and try to pay for something, more times than not I get to hear that they wont take anything larger than a $20. You cant hardly get lunch or buy a movie ticket for less than $10 bucks and stores still act like that $100 bill is worth something. I could buy more at a grocery store with a $20 bill 25 years ago then I can get today with that c-note. Crazy. Tranqual Money masters know what they are doing.Inflation has now been institutionalized at a fairly constant 5% per year. This has been determined to be the optimum level for generating the most revenue without causing public alarm. A 5% devaluation applies, not only to the money earned this year, but to all that is left over from previous years. At the end of the first year, a dollar is worth 95 cents. At the end of the second year, the 95 cents is reduced again by 5%, leaving its worth at 90 cents, and so on. By the time a person has worked 20 years, the government will have confiscated 64% of every dollar he saved over those years. By the time he has worked 45 years, the hidden tax will be 90%. The government will take virtually everything a person saves over a lifetime.  G. Edward Griffin By remaining behind the scenes, they (the Rothschilds) were able to avoid the brunt of public anger which was directed, instead, at the political figures which they largely controlled. This is a technique which has been practiced by financial manipulators ever since, and it is fully utilized by those who operate the Federal Reserve System today.  G. Edward Griffin [The] abandonment of the gold standard made it possible for the welfare statists to use the banking system as a means to an unlimited expansion of credit_. In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value. If there were, the government would have to make its holdings illegal, as was done in the case of gold_. The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves_. [This] is the shabby secret of the welfare statists tirades against gold. Deficit spending is simply a scheme for the hidden confiscation of wealth. Gold stands in the way of this insidious process. It stands as a protector of property rights.- Alan Greenspan in an article he wrote in 1966. And then Greenspan went over to the dark side and worked for the Fed. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method, they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls . . . become profiteers, who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished not less than the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds . . . all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless. From pages 220-233 of The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919), by John Maynard Keynes. You probably already know all this. XSANDIEGOCA I did. I will send this on. States it all in one place. Tranqual personally I dont think theres anything we can do. Ultimately its Gods judgment. When Jackson killed the central bank they just crashed the economy. It would take a miracle for most people to even understand the screw job. If any leader came on the scene and tried to kill the Fed the bankers would just constrict the money supply crash the economy. Frankly I believe we are in the end game. Only repentance and revival would give us more time as a nation. Sadly Im not optimistic about that either. We are already seeing the birthing of the apostate church. Trusting God will take care of the faithful remnant. Not looking forward to the days ahead. I wish Christians would have their eyes opened.
