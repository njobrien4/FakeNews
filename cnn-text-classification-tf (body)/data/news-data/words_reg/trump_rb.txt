Al Caiola, a versatile guitarist who recorded hit versions of the themes from the westerns “The Magnificent Seven” and “Bonanza” and worked with artists ranging from Buddy Holly to Tony Bennett, died on Nov. 9 in Allendale, N.J. He was 96. His death, at a nursing home, was confirmed by his daughter, Sandra Ayres. Mr. Caiola (pronounced kay-OH-lah) had Top 40 hits in 1961 with his renditions, on the United Artists label, of those two themes, becoming one of the relatively few artists to reach that plateau with instrumental recordings. His version of the galloping theme from the NBC western “Bonanza,” which began in 1959 and would end its hugely popular run in 1973, reached No. 19 on the Billboard singles chart. His rendition of the now-classic heroic theme, composed by Elmer Bernstein, from “The Magnificent Seven,” a 1960 film with Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, reached No. 35. The son of a New Jersey barber, Mr. Caiola started as a vocalist but was persuaded by his father that being an instrumentalist would offer more professional opportunities. His father was right. In the 1950s and ’60s, Mr. Caiola was one of the busiest guitarists in the recording studios of New York. In addition to Mr. Holly and Mr. Bennett, the many artists with whom he recorded or performed included Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Johnny Mathis, Simon and Garfunkel, Sarah Vaughan, Glen Campbell and Rosemary Clooney. He also played in orchestras led by Percy Faith, Morton Gould and Andre Kostelanetz, and on radio and television with Steve Allen, Jackie Gleason, Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan. And he recorded albums as a leader, beginning with “Deep in a Dream,” released in 1955 on Savoy, on which he led a jazz quartet featuring Hank Jones on piano. “He could play classical, rock ’n’ roll, R&B,” Moe Wechsler, a pianist who often recorded with Mr. Caiola, told The Palm Beach Post in 2004. “Al could do anything that was required; he’s the classic well-rounded musician.” Alexander Emil Caiola was born on Sept. 7, 1920, in Jersey City, to Emil Caiola and the former Genevieve Esposito. He began on the banjo, was a guitar prodigy by the age of 11, took formal lessons as a teenager at a Times Square studio and at 16 was already associated with his fellow guitarist Tony Mottola, performing with him on a children’s radio show, “Sally and Sam.” He enlisted in the Marines, where he performed in the Fifth Marine Division Band with the singer and bandleader Bob Crosby (Bing’s brother) and served as a stretcher bearer during World War II at Iwo Jima. After a brief interlude on the trumpet (he switched because marching bands largely forgo string instruments), he returned to guitar after the war and studied at the New Jersey College of Music on the G.I. Bill. He played an Epiphone Al Caiola Standard guitar. He was one of the first artists honored with a signature guitar in the modern era by the company, which was founded in 1873. In addition to his daughter, Mr. Caiola is survived by his wife, the former Rosalie Fiocco; a son, Alexander Jr.; four grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
JON BATISTE: ‘CHRISTMAS WITH JON BATISTE’ Naht Jona; CD, $9.99; MP3, $7.99  There’s a charming intimacy to much of this album, which Jon Batiste made on the side during his first year as bandleader for “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” The style runs from spare to plush, with Mr. Batiste’s soulful piano, voice and melodica as abiding constants. Along with his regular band mates, he enlists instrumental guests including the trumpeter Sean Jones, the percussionist Jason Marsalis and the violinist Lee England Jr. As for the vocal guests, they include Judith Hill, on a slinky “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,” and Aloe Blacc, on the exhortatory, gospel-tinged original “Endless Love.” NATE CHINEN LAUREN DAIGLE: ‘BEHOLD: A CHRISTMAS COLLECTION’ Centricity, $10 You can hear the Louisiana seeping through “Behold,” the impressive holiday album by Lauren Daigle, her generation’s most promising singer of contemporary Christian music. Sometimes it’s in the arrangements, like on “Jingle Bells,” which pulses with New Orleans-informed jazz and swing. But mainly her home state is in her voice, which unlike that of many of her genre peers, is rife with ambiguity, not clarity. That means an “O Come All Ye Faithful” that’s more unsteady dirge than regal announcement, and a “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” that, thanks to the appealing drag in her vocals, is tranquil, cozy and flirty. JON CARAMANICA BRETT ELDREDGE: ‘GLOW’ Atlantic Nashville; CD, $9.97; MP3, $9.49 Perhaps you have listened to the youngish country star Brett Eldredge and wondered just how, even in these polyglot, borderless, permissive times, he makes sense in Nashville. If that city has lately been dominated by bros, he is a gentleman; his twang feels digitally augmented. “Glow,” his first holiday album, makes the disconnect clear: It turns out Mr. Eldredge is a disarming crooner deeply at home in front of a big band. He achieves a striking Sinatra-lite on “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” and wrings “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” into a scene of pure pathos. JON CARAMANICA AMY GRANT: ‘TENNESSEE CHRISTMAS’ Amy Grant Productions/Sparrow/Capitol; CD, $8.89; $9.49 It has been more than 30 years since Amy Grant released her first Christmas album, which opened with a cozy original, “Tennessee Christmas.” This album begins the same way, but don’t dismiss it as a retread. Ms. Grant, a longtime beacon in contemporary Christian music, is also a fixture of Nashville, where she recorded these songs at her home studio. Naturally, there’s a cameo by her husband, Vince Gill, who brings a silvery gleam to “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.” And in addition to friskier holiday fare, Ms. Grant offers a few bittersweet new ballads like “Melancholy Christmas,” which sets the stage with a relatable couplet: “I post another picture from the quiet of my room/And wonder who’ll like it, and wonder what to do.” NATE CHINEN KURT ELLING: ‘THE BEAUTIFUL DAY: KURT ELLING SINGS CHRISTMAS’ OKeh/Sony Masterworks; CD $10.79, MP3, $9.99 Kurt Elling wasn’t interested in a ring-a-ding holiday album; for a jazz singer of his temperament, that would have been too routine a challenge. What he made instead is a brooding, earnest reflection on the rites of the season, both religious and secular. Mr. Elling is sparkling and sure covering Donny Hathaway’s “This Christmas” and Dan Fogelberg’s “Same Old Lang Syne.” But his heart seems more honestly aligned with several numbers from “Scrooge: The Musical” (including the title track) and a haunted ballad called “The Michigan Farm (Cradle Song Op. 41/1),” which sets original lyrics to a 19th-century lullaby by Edvard Grieg. NATE CHINEN KACEY MUSGRAVES: ‘A VERY KACEY CHRISTMAS’ Mercury; CD, $8.90; MP3, $9.49 What better turn than a Christmas album for an artist whose mission is to uphold tradition under the cover of mild subversion? Kacey Musgraves’s first holiday album is by and large delightful, full of sweet, measured singing; varied arrangements, from Western swing to vintage soul; and catholic song choice, including the 1950s novelty “I Want a Hippopotamus for Christmas.” There are also four originals, the best of which is “A Willie Nice Christmas” (featuring Willie Nelson), on which she sings, over Hawaiian guitar, “I’m gonna wrap my presents up in red bandannas/and leave some special cookies out for Santa.” Get it? The cookies have marijuana in them. They’re marijuana cookies. For Santa. JON CARAMANICA R. KELLY: ‘12 NIGHTS OF CHRISTMAS’ RCA; CD, $8; MP3, $9.99 “Mrs. Santa Claus/This year will be, this year will be/the year I make holiday love to you”: R. Kelly would like to bring you tidings of comfort and joy and maybe some other things too. “12 Nights of Christmas” is his first holiday album in a two-decades-plus career toggling between the carnal and the spiritual. He doesn’t take the challenge lightly on this ambitious album: There are a dozen songs, all originals. Some are perfectly pleasant, others, like the afore-quoted “Mrs. Santa Claus,” are transfixing. Mostly, Mr. Kelly is in his polite, adult-contemporary R&B mode, making music for Chicago steppers ready for a grown-folks night out. But after the night out comes the night in, as the grunts and howls on “Christmas Lovin’” make clear. JON CARAMANICA JENNIFER NETTLES: ‘TO CELEBRATE CHRISTMAS’ Big Machine; CD, $8.99; MP3, $9.49 If there’s no room in country music’s mainstream for Jennifer Nettles’s gargantuan voice, it’s a relief she found the willing canvas of holiday music. These standards don’t just forgive elegantly shouted singing, they encourage it. So Ms. Nettles howls on “O Holy Night,” leans into “The First Noel” with dignity and fire, and brings sass to “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,” an ice-cool duet with Andra Day. Like Ms. Nettles, the arrangements by Tim Lauer and Julian Raymond have just enough bite to invigorate the familiar — the easy guitar march on “O Holy Night,” or the rockabilly arrangement of the black spiritual “Go Tell It on the Mountain.” JON CARAMANICA PENTATONIX: ‘A PENTATONIX CHRISTMAS’ RCA; CD, $6.99; MP3, $9.99 How long has it been since Pentatonix, the wildly popular, pneumatically precise a cappella group, last released a holiday album? Two years, since “That’s Christmas to Me,” which sold more than two million copies. If you liked that album, there’s no reason you wouldn’t like this one, which also emulsifies carols and Christmas standards to the consistency of a smoothie. Maybe you’ll want to know that there’s a solemn cover of a track by Kanye West (“Coldest Winter”); maybe you already know that there’s a dim, cloying cover of “Hallelujah,” the Leonard Cohen hymn. But the best news here suggests a merciful awareness of diminishing returns: In its entirety, the album lasts just under 35 minutes. NATE CHINEN LORETTA LYNN: ‘WHITE CHRISTMAS BLUE’ Legacy; CD, $10.29; MP3, $10.99 The manger isn’t far from the honky-tonk on Loretta Lynn’s Christmas collection, which has songs from the trove of recordings she began making in the 2000s with Johnny Cash’s son, John Carter Cash, at the Cash Cabin Studio. Ms. Lynn’s voice is pure Appalachia, with openhearted respect in religious songs and a touch of swing on tunes like “Blue Christmas.” The arrangements hark back to the down-home understatement of 1960s country, placing just the right piano tinkle or steel-guitar turn between verses. When Ms. Lynn recites “’Twas the Night Before Christmas” backed by a guitar, Santa’s farewell is “Merry Christmas, you all, and to all a good night.” JON PARELES SARAH MCLACHLAN: ‘WONDERLAND’ Verve; CD, $11.99, MP3, $9.49 The cozy benevolence of Sarah McLachlan’s voice is the constant on an album that puts considerable thought into customizing familiar songs. There are echoes of Phil Spector and the Beach Boys in the steady quarter-note chords behind “Let It Snow.” “Away in a Manger” arrives with a different melody, as a countryish waltz with vocal harmonies from Emmylou Harris; “Huron Carol,” a Celtic-tinged Canadian hymn, gets full orchestral drama. Some choices are fussy and overblown, but Ms. McLachlan’s voice always provides warmth. JON PARELES SHE & HIM: ‘CHRISTMAS PARTY’ Columbia, $10.99 She & Him — the actress Zooey Deschanel and the guitarist M. Ward — keep a casual, home-recorded air on their second holiday album, “Christmas Party.” Ms. Deschanel has a pretty mezzo-soprano, a semipro with lapses in concentration, while Mr. Ward sings, in his occasional appearances, no better or worse than a session guitarist. Friends drop by, including Sonic Youth’s drummer, Steve Shelley, and indie-pop harmonizers like Jenny Lewis and the Chapin Sisters. Among many familiar songs is a record-collector find: Vashti Bunyan’s “The Coldest Night of the Year.” She & Him can’t match the freak-folk Phil Spector aura of the original. But along with the rest of the album, it’s a suggestion to find your own Christmas nuggets and sing them yourself. JON PARELES
BIG STAR: ‘COMPLETE THIRD’ Omnivore; three CDs; $49.98; MP3, $19.99; omnivorerecordings.com It could have been even messier. Big Star’s “Third” was the bewildering and later beloved (particularly by indie-rockers) album recorded in 1974 by the songwriter Alex Chilton at a druggie, drunken, experimental extreme. Radiant melodies grappled with clutter and noise; longing and reverence collided with snark and despair. Rightly considered uncommercial, it wasn’t released until 1978, and its assorted versions have no definite sequence or even an official title. “Complete Third” joins the album’s 20 final masters with Mr. Chilton’s gleaming, open solo demos for the songs, along with out-on-a-limb mixes by its producer, Jim Dickinson, and more straightforward mixes by the engineer John Fry. It reveals the choices behind a ramshackle landmark. JON PARELES ‘BOBO YÉYÉ: BELLE ÉPOQUE IN UPPER VOLTA’ Numero Group; three CDs, 144-page book; $35; numerogroup.com Music is only half of “Bobo Yéyé,” a box featuring 1960s and ’70s recordings by four bands from Upper Volta (which became Burkina Faso in 1984). It’s also a comprehensive portfolio of photographs by Sory Sanlé: studio portraits and casual images of a vital, bygone African era. The music is what made Sanlé’s subjects dance. Orchestre Volta-Jazz pulls Afro-Cuban music and American soul back toward Africa. Dafra Star (founded by Volta-Jazz’s star singer, Coulibaly Tidiani) brings out African rhythms, often with a balafon (marimba). Echo Del Africa National and Les Imbattables Léopards, which share the third CD, are smoother; though their ballads sag, they also find some funk. JON PARELES DAVID BOWIE: ‘WHO CAN I BE NOW? (1974-1976)’ Parlophone; 12 CDs, $175.99; 13 LPs, $296.99 This exhaustive reissue gathers David Bowie’s music just before, during and after his mid-1970s “plastic soul” phase, extending from “Diamond Dogs” to “Station to Station,” plus two concert recordings and full-album alternate mixes and edits. It reassembles an unreleased 1974 album, “The Gouster,” a preliminary version of “Young Americans” with three songs, though all have previously been reissued. Recording at Sigma Sound in Philadelphia, Bowie was soaking up the warmth and dynamics of American R&B and bonding with dance music. An extended, jamming remake of “John, I’m Only Dancing” and the gradual soul-gospel buildups of “It’s Gonna Be Me” and “Who Can I Be Now?” show a gifted disciple learning fast and moving ahead. JON PARELES FLEETWOOD MAC: ‘MIRAGE’ Warner Bros./Rhino; three CDs, one LP and one DVD, $99.98; expanded CD, $19.98; remastered CD, $11.98 rhino.com “Mirage,” from 1982, has the high gloss and musical facility of the blockbuster Fleetwood Mac albums that preceded it — “Fleetwood Mac,” “Rumours” and “Tusk” — but fewer memorable songs; in hindsight, it sounds more facile and complacent. The 19 early versions and outtakes on the added disc are less layered, less pretty, more exposed and a little darker. One outtake, Stevie Nicks’s furious “Smile at You,” waited until 2003 for an official studio version. Confections like “Hold Me” were improved by later tinkering; confessions like “That’s Alright,” perhaps not. The deluxe version’s third CD is a “Mirage” tour concert; the DVD has the original album in high-resolution audio. JON PARELES GAS: ‘BOX’ Kompakt; 10 LPs, four CDs and a book, $165.98; strandedrecords.com Wolfgang Voigt, who founded the minimal techno label Kompakt, released ambient albums in the 1990s as GAS, a fitting rubric for music that was richly amorphous and invisibly yet thoroughly pervasive — and, later, influential. Blurry, sustained tones that might be orchestral or electronic and quiet, shifting fields of static hover over muffled beats and subtly rhythmic washes of noise. In a way, the tracks merge the glacial symphonic raptures of Bruckner and Wagner with the loops and pulsations of dance music; they can be simultaneously serene and ominous. “Box” includes both vinyl and CD versions of the albums “Zauberberg,” “Königsforst,” “Pop” and the EP “Oktember,” reissuing what were double vinyl albums on three LPs each to make room for unedited versions and better sound. JON PARELES THE GRATEFUL DEAD: ‘JULY 1978: THE COMPLETE RECORDINGS’ Rhino; 12 CDs, $129.98; dead.net The Grateful Dead’s 1978 lineup was a prime one: a limber, adventurous band with Keith Godchaux on piano and some fresh, challenging material from the 1977 album “Terrapin Station.” This elaborately packaged box gathers five shows on 12 discs, crisply recorded to reveal every iota of Dead counterpoint. The band peaks in a jet-fueled Minnesota show and in its first two concerts at Red Rocks in Colorado, but there’s plenty to enjoy elsewhere. JON PARELES NRBQ: ‘HIGH NOON: A 50-YEAR RETROSPECTIVE’ Omnivore; five CDs, $56.99; nrbq.com A good-time spirit runs through the music of NRBQ, which stands for New Rhythm and Blues Quartet (initially Quintet) but has never been bound to R&B or any other genre. Started in 1966 with home recordings — there’s one in this collection — NRBQ is rooted in a 1950s of rockabilly, blues, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Thelonious Monk and Sun Ra, along with a 1960s of early Beatles and Beach Boys. Their songs hold chromatic twists and wry wordplay, packed into smiley three-minute bundles. “High Noon” combines a best-of with many rarities, suiting a band that’s both crafty and casual. JON PARELES OTIS REDDING: ‘LIVE AT THE WHISKY A GO GO: THE COMPLETE RECORDINGS’ Stax; six CDs, $44.99; amazon.com In the 1960s, even a soul hitmaker like Otis Redding — “Respect,” “Can’t Turn You Loose,” “Satisfaction” — had a grinding schedule. He played seven sets in three days at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles in 1966, a gig that moved him up out of the R&B circuit. Redding had hits to perform, but he didn’t go for routine; he constantly changed up set lists. His nine-piece road band (horns and all) hit the arrangements as hard as the nonpareil Stax studio band, but with variations: fast and indomitable one night, slower and bluesier on another. And Redding used his velvet-lined growl of a voice to capture pride, desire, exultation and pain — just a great soul man, hard at work. JON PARELES LOU REED: ‘THE RCA & ARISTA ALBUMS COLLECTION’ RCA/Arista/Legacy; 17 CDs, 80-page book, extras, $199; legacyrecordings.com  Lou Reed’s last project was to remaster the 16 albums he released from 1972 to 1986. They included masterpieces (“Transformer,” “Berlin,” “Street Hassle”), novelties (the comedic rants of “Take No Prisoners”), provocations (“Metal Machine Music,” now recognized as a monument of Minimalistic noise), misfires (“Coney Island Baby”) and plenty of solidly rewarding albums that fall somewhere in between (“The Blue Mask,” “New Sensations,” “Mistrial”). Along the way, Reed occasionally set aside but invariably returned to his hallowed lineup of two guitars, bass and drums, rethinking them every time — and, decades later, remastering them for more space and bite. JON PARELES SOUNDGARDEN: ‘BADMOTORFINGER’ UMe/A&M Records; four CDs, two DVDs and one Blu-ray audio, $149.99; two CDs, $18.99; two LPs, $27.99; one CD, $12.99; soundgarden.shop.livenation.com Soundgarden’s 1991 album, “Badmotorfinger,” brought the band to its heaving, hard-riffing, leather-lunged, ferocious extreme, fully establishing it as the grunge extension of Led Zeppelin, with Chris Cornell singing about defiance and rage rather than cockiness. Three years later “Superunknown,” with a tincture of melody, would carry Soundgarden to its commercial peak. For its 25th anniversary, a remastered “Badmotorfinger” is paired with noisier outtakes — less polished, equally brawny — of the entire album, including a version of “New Damage” with Queen’s Brian May on lead guitar. The deluxe version adds a hometown Seattle concert in audio and video, a documentary and a surround-sound remix. JON PARELES DOLLY PARTON, EMMYLOU HARRIS, LINDA RONSTADT: ‘THE COMPLETE TRIO COLLECTION’ Warner Bros./Rhino; three CDs, $29.98; rhino.com Three solo careers aligned just twice — with sessions in 1986 and 1994 — for Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt to record two albums of luminous, largely acoustic Southern California country-pop together as Trio. They harked back to Appalachian tradition even in nontraditional songs like Neil Young’s “After the Gold Rush” and Phil Spector’s “To Know Him Is to Love Him,” and their mutual respect shines through performances that were all about shared vocal harmonies. A third disc, of 20 outtakes, includes some alternate versions with more extroverted lead vocals in the spotlight. But at the time, Trio chose closer blends instead. JON PARELES BLONDE REDHEAD: ‘MASCULIN FÉMININ’ Numero Group; four LPs, $50; two CDs, $25; numerogroup.com Blonde Redhead released its first two albums in 1995, part of a downtown New York indie-rock moment still preoccupied with Sonic Youth’s muscular and meditative dissonance and the long tail of no wave. But what’s clear in this collection of early work — those first two albums, along with demos, outtakes and radio performances from the same era — is not just how this band smartly mainlined those ideas, but also its quirky sweetness. Here was a group that had cool reserve, nimble tension and an elegant warmth spread across it all. JON CARAMANICA EGYPTIAN LOVER: ‘1983-1988’ Stones Throw; four LPs, $45; CD, $15; MP3, $11.99; stonesthrow.com Before gangster rap became the ubiquitous soundtrack of Los Angeles, Egyptian Lover’s sensual electro-rap was one of the defining sounds of the city. Honed at live parties, his style was flamboyant and loose, and also comic: He was a hilarious character and a fountain of over-the-top dirty talk. But while his rhymes could be elemental, his zippy, throbbing production — an unending pulse that verged on the erotic — felt like the future. JON CARAMANICA ‘LIVE AT DBA: START YOUR OWN ___ SHOW SPACE’ Famous Class; three LPs, $38; three LPs and hardcover book, $73; famousclass.com Death by Audio, the warehouse venue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was raucous and communally inclined, and in the summer, woefully under-air-conditioned. For nearly a decade, until its eviction in November 2014, it was one of that neighborhood’s essential listening posts, especially as the area began to coalesce around tense, frustrated, sloppy punk. That’s the prevailing ethos of this exuberant collection of recordings made during Death by Audio’s final month, one song per show. It intends to be a sort of Festschrift for one special venue, but ends up one for a sound that’s evaporated, and a neighborhood that doesn’t remember. JON CARAMANICA ‘BOOMBOX: EARLY INDEPENDENT HIP HOP, ELECTRO AND DISCO RAP 1979-82’ Soul Jazz; two CDs, $19.99; amazon.com In 1979, after “Rapper’s Delight” forced rapping out of park jams and block parties and onto records, the scramble to capitalize on that budding genre was fast, with a gaggle of small labels emerging to sate the hunger. This smart anthology captures that moment via songs that follow the template of that foundational hit: casual, slick boasting over live bands playing disco licks. Some of these songs, like “Rappers Convention,” are part of the era’s primary narrative, but here they share space with worthy peers who have largely flown below the historical radar: Count Coolout, Mistafide, Mr. Sweety G. JON CARAMANICA ‘BAD BOY 20TH ANNIVERSARY BOX SET EDITION’ Bad Boy/Rhino; five CDs, $49.98; rhino.com Given how quickly hip-hop moves these days, the peak Bad Boy era of the mid- to late-1990s — the Notorious B.I.G.! Mase! Puff Daddy learning to rap in public! — feels like 10 lifetimes ago, but therein lay almost all the blueprints for what came next: melody’s full absorption into hip-hop, followed by hip-hop’s full absorption into pop. This thorough collection is arranged in loose thematic groupings, not chronologically, to emphasize a label that was tough when it wanted to be, tender when it wanted to be, and most of the time, preferred not to choose. JON CARAMANICA ‘CLASSIC SAVOY BE-BOP SESSIONS 1945-49’ Mosaic; 10 CDs, $169; mosaicrecords.com The incandescent brilliance of Charlie Parker’s output on Savoy Records, well burnished in other boxed sets, has often obscured the work of bebop’s other early adopters, who receive their proper due here. Highlights include the earliest sessions by the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon and sparkling work by the trombonist J. J. Johnson, the trumpeter Fats Navarro and the baritone saxophonist Leo Parker. The sound restoration is superb, and an extensive booklet sheds light on both the sessions and their roguish producer, a self-described “jazz hustler” named Teddy Reig. NATE CHINEN MILES DAVIS QUINTET: ‘FREEDOM JAZZ DANCE: THE BOOTLEG SERIES, VOL. 5’ Legacy; three CDs, $27.99 at Amazon; MP3, $19.99; legacyrecordings.com The Miles Davis Quintet of the mid-1960s has often justly been hailed as one of the great small groups in the history of jazz. It has also been exhaustively chronicled, which makes this set feel like a fait accompli. A fly-on-the-wall glimpse into the recording studio, it traffics in alternate takes, rehearsal material and intra-band discussion, including every second of tape from the sessions for the album “Miles Smiles.” Only serious obsessives need inquire, but for anyone fitting that description, it’s a motherlode. NATE CHINEN KEITH JARRETT: ‘A MULTITUDE OF ANGELS’ ECM; four CDs, $51.29; ecmrecords.com Keith Jarrett became the most celebrated improvising solo pianist of the modern era on the basis of “The Köln Concert,” a wildly successful album of long-form inventions from 1975. This engrossing set consists of four previously unreleased concerts from an Italian tour in 1996, the last of his solo tours to adhere to a similarly sprawling format. Each concert has its own arc and character, balancing deep rhapsody against thorny dissonance. By Mr. Jarrett’s own estimation, writing in the liner notes, this body of work represents a pinnacle of his career. NATE CHINEN KRIS KRISTOFFERSON: ‘THE COMPLETE MONUMENT & COLUMBIA ALBUM COLLECTION’ Legacy; 16 CDs, $86.99; MP3, $99.99; legacyrecordings.com So many of the factors that sealed Kris Kristofferson’s granite reputation as a songwriter and outlaw-country hero — his knack for aphorism, his stoic eloquence, his tender empathy — can be clearly identified on “Kristofferson,” his arresting debut, released on Monument Records in 1970. It’s the first disc in this collection, which includes all his albums for the label, up to the 1981 masterwork “To the Bone.” There’s also a hit-or-miss assortment of newly unearthed demos; a compilation of nonalbum tracks, including some duets with Willie Nelson; and three riveting concert recordings, the first of which, “Live at the Big Sur Folk Festival,” is a previously unissued portrait of the artist as a young bandleader, already radiating his skeptical, rangy charm. NATE CHINEN THE BAND: ‘THE LAST WALTZ 40TH ANNIVERSARY EDITIONS’ Rhino; four CDs, two Blu-rays and a 300-page hardcover book, $259.98; six LPs, $119.98; four CDs and one Blu-ray, $64.98; two CDs, $19.98; rhino.com Forty years ago this Thanksgiving, the Band threw itself a farewell party at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. Billed as “The Last Waltz,” it featured an all-star roster of friends and collaborators, like Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Muddy Waters and Neil Young. A dazzling concert film of the same name, directed by Martin Scorsese, gave the evening an aura of legend, which is surely one reason its anniversary has been met with such a grand commemorative ballyhoo. The simplest of these editions is a remastered version of the original soundtrack, on two CDs; the most elaborate is a limited-edition splurge, featuring a faux-leather-bound copy of Mr. Scorsese’s shooting script. A deluxe edition includes the film on Blu-ray, the full concert audio and a handful of rehearsal tracks, like Van Morrison’s easing into ecstatic form on “Caravan.” NATE CHINEN ‘WAXING THE GOSPEL: MASS EVANGELISM AND THE PHONOGRAPH, 1890-1900’ Archeophone; three CDs and a 408-page hardcover book, $55; archeophone.com The commercial advent of recorded sound coincided with a boom in mass evangelism in the United States — not an arbitrary overlap, as this collection definitively shows. A product of many years of scholarship, scavenging and restoration, the collection draws from dozens of rare wax cylinders, sorting them in three categories: commercial recordings, by enterprising souls like the revivalist minister Frank Butts; celebrity recordings, notably those by the gospel baritone Ira D. Sankey; and vernacular recordings, including what’s known as the Heath cache, much of it traceable to a camp meeting on the Jersey Shore in 1897. A handsome hardcover book, packed with context, underscores the magnitude of the effort behind this groundbreaking set. NATE CHINEN
WASHINGTON — President Obama officially pardoned two turkeys on Wednesday, in an oddly mournful replaying of a White House Thanksgiving ritual that not even his daughters attended. Standing in for the president’s two daughters were two nephews, Austin Robinson, 6, and Aaron Robinson, 4, “who, unlike Malia and Sasha, have not yet been turned cynical by Washington,” Mr. Obama joked. “They still believe in bad puns. They still appreciate the grandeur of this occasion. They still have hope.” At the mention of “hope,” the crowd in the Rose Garden — made up of family and friends getting perhaps one last visit to the White House grounds — grew quiet, and Mr. Obama’s staff, gathered along the nearby colonnade, looked grim. Mr. Obama has spent much of the last two weeks as a kind of crisis counselor, trying to persuade his staff and Hillary Clinton’s supporters that Donald J. Trump’s victory will not spell disaster for Mr. Obama’s priorities or the nation. And on Wednesday, the president was at his this-will-all-be-all-right best. The occasion was one of those somewhat odd White House traditions that become enshrined on the calendar in part because nobody quite knows how to kill them. The notion that a pardon given to two turkeys out of 46 million slaughtered for the Thanksgiving holiday should be some kind of feel-good event has always felt a bit off. Mr. Obama has long papered over the awkwardness with a speech peppered with puns. But with his legacy on the chopping block this year, even a few puns could not dispel the feeling of a New Orleans funeral — celebratory but with an underlying sadness. “I know there are some bad ones in here, but this is the last time I’m doing this, so we’re not leaving any room for leftovers,” Mr. Obama said to some laughter. Putting aside the jokes, Mr. Obama spent part of his speech trumpeting his administration’s accomplishments on jobs, housing and health care. It was a mini stump speech that most in the crowd had heard many times, but they clapped with gusto nonetheless. “That’s worth gobbling about,” Mr. Obama said. Then he grew somber and gave one of what will be many goodbyes. “On this Thanksgiving, I want to express my sincere gratitude to the American people for the trust that you’ve placed in me over these last eight years and the incredible kindness that you’ve shown my family,” Mr. Obama said. “On behalf of Michelle, and my mother-in-law and our girls, we want to thank you so very, very much.” He then dismissed the crowd with one last stab at good wordplay, saying, “And so let’s get on with the pardoning, because it’s Wednesday afternoon and everybody knows that Thanksgiving traffic can put everybody in a foul mood.”
Edgar Chase Jr., known as Dooky, who with his wife, the chef Leah Chase, turned his family’s New Orleans restaurant into a showcase for Creole cuisine and a gathering spot for activists during the civil rights era, died on Tuesday in New Orleans. He was 88. The death was confirmed by his granddaughter Tracie Griffin. Mr. Chase, a jazz trumpeter, was known throughout the South as the leader of the Dooky Chase Orchestra, a big band that he started in high school; his older sister, Doris, was its vocalist. In the early 1950s, as his father’s health declined, he stepped in to run Dooky Chase, the family’s little bar and grill in the city’s Tremé neighborhood. When his wife, the former Leah Lange, took her place behind the stove, the restaurant began evolving from a simple cafe into one of the city’s foremost exponents of Creole cooking, as well as an informal gallery for black artists. It became a magnet for black musicians, actors and politicians passing through town and, as the civil rights movement gathered momentum, a meeting place where organizers, both black and white, sat down to plan strategy in the upstairs dining room. Although Jim Crow laws forbade the races to mix in restaurants, city officials turned the other way in the case of Dooky Chase, fearful of the public response if they tried to intervene. Mr. Chase, a member of the N.A.A.C.P. and an active campaigner for voting rights, made his restaurant available to local civil rights lawyers and nationally recognized leaders like Thurgood Marshall and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Edgar Lawrence Chase Jr. was born in New Orleans on March 23, 1928. His father, also called Dooky, started the business in 1939 as a corner stand. (It also sold lottery tickets.) His mother, the former Emily Tenette, would make sandwiches, and young Edgar Jr. often delivered them. With $600 borrowed from a brewery, the Chases enlarged their stand and in 1941 opened the Dooky Chase Restaurant, which quickly became a neighborhood hub, in part because it was one of the few places where black workers could cash their paychecks. Mr. Chase, after graduating from Booker T. Washington High School, toured with his band, billed as “the Pride of New Orleans.” While performing at a Mardi Gras ball in 1945, he met his future wife, whom he married the next year. She went on to become a much-honored chef, cookbook author and television personality. She survives him, as do their three children, Stella Reese, Leah Kamata and Edgar Chase III, also known as Dooky; 16 grandchildren; and 26 great-grandchildren. The restaurant closed for two years after Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, and Mr. Chase and his wife moved into a FEMA trailer across the street. The rebuilding effort moved slowly, in part because Mr. Chase did not like to borrow money, or spend it. “He wouldn’t give a crippled crab a crutch to get to a gumbo party,” Mrs. Chase told The New York Times in 2003. Two years after the hurricane, Dooky Chase reopened. Mr. Chase was active in civic affairs for much of his life. He was a board member of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival in its formative years and vice president of the New Orleans Tourist Commission from 1978 to 1983.
If the supposed war on Christmas is still being waged, you’d never know it from the television listings for the next few weeks. Christmas — which conservative critics have complained has been marginalized in our cross-cultural age — is everywhere this season, often right in the titles of specials and made-for-TV movies. And one of the first examples comes Friday night on that most libertine of cable outlets, HBO. It’s “Once Upon a Sesame Street Christmas,” a music-dotted fable in the tradition of “Christmas Eve on Sesame Street,” “Elmo Saves Christmas” and assorted other holiday offerings featuring the furry gang. The “Sesame Street” franchise moved to HBO early this year, and it shows in the casting of the new special: The guest stars include Zosia Mamet of the HBO series “Girls.” (Also turning up: Jim Gaffigan, unrecognizable in a Santa suit, and Audra McDonald.) The show, pleasant and witty, contains obligatory references to Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, but the story is decidedly about Christmas — or, more correctly, about the dark time in Sesame Street’s past, when Christmas was not celebrated, decorations were not hung, and Santa did not bother stopping. That might sound as if it were some kind of metaphor for the very war-on-Christmas world those aforementioned critics have trumpeted, but really it’s just a bedtime story being told to Elmo by his father. The tale results in a flashback to a Dickensian-looking period when Sesame Street was known as “the unfriendliest street in town” and ancestors of all the current gang spent their days crabbing at one another. (Oscar the Grouch’s “great-great-grand-Grouch” was, we learn, named Oscar the Malcontent.) A forebear of Elmo’s is a new arrival on the street, and he sets about changing the prevailing mind-set, introducing concepts like generosity and good will. Elmo and HBO are actually a bit slow to board the Christmas bandwagon; the Hallmark Channel began its annual “Countdown to Christmas” weeks ago. It has already debuted original movies that include “Every Christmas Has a Story,” “Christmas Cookies” and “My Christmas Dream,” while its companion channel, Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, has introduced “Finding Father Christmas” and “Operation Christmas.” Still to come, to name just the most imminent Hallmark Channel films: “Christmas in Homestead” (Thursday night), “Christmas List” (Friday), “A Heavenly Christmas” (Saturday) and “Journey Back to Christmas” (Sunday). Lifetime is almost as fond of “Christmas” titles, as in “All I Want for Christmas” (Saturday night) and “A Christmas Wedding Date” (Dec. 10). The UP TV programming stunt “We Get Christmas” — which, like Hallmark’s “Countdown to Christmas,” began a few weeks ago — includes the world-premiere movies “A Puppy for Christmas” (Friday night), “Falling for Christmas” (Saturday), “The Rooftop Christmas Tree” (Sunday) and “Girlfriends of Christmas Past” (Dec. 4). As that last title suggests, somehow the Christmas story has been invaded by singles seeking to fill a romantic or other void in their lives. On Saturday, TV One’s monthlong “TV Winter Onederland” has “The Christmas Swap,” which the channel describes as the story of “a down-on-his-luck single father” who “questions his decision to give up his dreams to take care of his ailing mother.” On the same channel on Dec. 10: “Merry Ex-Mas,” about a “mild-mannered single mother” who sets out to foil her ex-husband’s remarriage. Most of this fare strays quite far from the actual Christmas story, the one in the Christian Bible. Dolly Parton, at least, is not afraid to put a little faith back into the equation with “Dolly Parton’s Christmas of Many Colors: Circle of Love,” Nov. 30 on NBC. Like “Dolly Parton’s Coat of Many Colors” last year, it is inspired by her own childhood, and it’s short on subtlety. But at least it doesn’t shy away from the sacred side of Christmas. The best of the religious-themed Christmas shows is a little harder to find and doesn’t blare its seasonal intentions in the title. It’s “Winter Thaw,” Thanksgiving night on BYUtv. It’s a quiet, beautifully acted adaptation of a Leo Tolstoy story, “Where Love Is, God Is,” with John Rhys-Davies as a gnarled, embittered cobbler who learns that he holds within himself the key to breaking out of his misery. So is there still a war on Christmas? There certainly is in “SuperMansion: War on Christmas,” a hilarious special episode of Crackle’s animated “SuperMansion” show that is the polar opposite of the dignified story of the cobbler. The series is about an assortment of inept superheroes, and in the Christmas special, which begins streaming Dec. 8, they have to band together to save Christmas from a psychotic doll. The plot is too bizarre for further description; suffice it to say that if you like your holiday fare demented and fearless rather than subdued, this one’s for you.
This interview with John Lilly, a partner at Greylock Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant. Q. What were your early years like? Were you in leadership roles early on? A. My dad was in the Air Force, and we moved around a lot. There was a stretch when I went to a different school every year. We lived in San Antonio before I went to college. I learned a lot from being in a marching band. I was playing trumpet, and it was a 200-piece marching band, exactly like in “Friday Night Lights.” I became a section leader, and we would get up at 6:30 in the morning and do all our drills when it was still dark. Then I went to Stanford, where I had a lot of great leadership opportunities. As a sophomore, I ran the kitchen for our dormitory. Another guy and I had a budget of about $300,000 a year and we were responsible for feeding 80 people and hiring staff. When you were younger, did you mind moving so often? I don’t remember kicking or screaming. I always just thought it was a pretty good adventure. I’m pretty adaptable. I’m good at packing and unpacking. Tell me more about your parents. They both have a good sense of humor and like jokes, and humor’s a big part of what I value and how I lead. And they’re both analytical. Mom’s an accountant. Dad was a physics major but then became an engineer. I remember when I was in second grade, we needed a new TV. All my friends would just go to the store and buy one, but my dad bought a Heathkit, and we had to put together the parts. I remember being mortified and saying, “Dad, why can’t we go buy a TV like everybody else?” But in retrospect, it taught me that everything is made by people. We look at our technology now, like iPhones, and I think a lot of people see them as magical obelisks from the mountains that Steve Jobs bestows on us. Early leadership lessons for you? I didn’t understand the role of simplicity and messaging early on. One of the things that happened at one of my start-ups was that I would get bored saying the same thing every day. So I decided to change it up a little bit. But then everybody had a different idea of what I thought because I was mixing it up. So my big lesson was the importance of a simple message, and saying it the same way over and over. If you’re going to change it, change it in a big way, and make sure everyone knows it’s a change. Otherwise keep it static. You spend a lot of your time meeting with C.E.O.s to decide whether to invest in their companies. How do you assess them? One is sort of a context-free assessment, which is, who is this person and how do they behave? The other is a contextual assessment, which is, am I any good for this person? There are some amazing C.E.O.s who I just don’t know how to interact with because of stylistic differences. You have to have both because you want to make good investments, but you also want to make good investments where you can work with the person. I ask a lot of questions, but I almost don’t care what the questions are. When people start talking about their business plan, I’ll say, “What about this, what about this, what about this?” You start to expand the scope of the questions to try to see two things. One is the quality of their thought process. And the other is how they interact with you. Do they become defensive? Do they become aggressive? Are they listening? You’re trying to get a sense of whether, in a complicated situation with a lot of things going on, can they be honest and candid and still get to a productive place. Sometimes you get honest and candid, and sometimes you get antagonistic or defensive. As a V.C., I’ll meet with probably 400 companies a year and I’ll invest in two of them. The context of those meetings is highly variable, and the power dynamics are all bizarre because you come into this 60-minute crucible moment. You have to go out of your way to make sure that your questioning is understood. When I was a V.C. at first, I would just ask my questions and kind of poke, poke, poke, poke. And now I’ll say: “Look, I’m going to ask some things, and this might be kind of awkward, but I’m just going to say it, and let’s work our way through it. And it doesn’t mean I don’t believe in you and your company. I just want to understand where you are and what you think. I’m going to ask some things and they might be wrong, but let’s figure some things out together.” The one thing that’s profoundly different about being a V.C. compared to an operator is that V.C.s talk a lot about FOMO — fear of missing out. You turn things down all the time, and you worry, what did I miss and what did I get wrong? As an operator, you focus 100 percent on what you’re doing. As a V.C., you wonder what you’re not doing. It’s a difference in perspective. What career and life advice do you give to new college grads? One is, to use the words of my colleague Reid Hoffman at Greylock, find your tribe. You should look around and figure out whose team you’re on and whose team you’re not on. And for the people whose team you want to be on, you need to invest in those relationships and treat them well and spend time with them. The choices you make on who you stand with, and who you stand against, will matter. The other thing I would say is to stay close to professions that create and make things, and stay away from derivative professions like finance. I think makers increasingly have the power in our society.
Martine Hul is the self-appointed queen of pavé diamonds. In 2000, she first made her mark in the jewelry world by designing earrings with lines of pavé stones — the customer could choose one to seven rows. “At that time, here in Antwerp, 99 percent of the jewelry was so classic,” Ms. Hul said, noting that the pavé technique, which uses smaller and therefore less costly stones, allowed her to experiment with designs while keeping costs low, introducing a new, younger audience to diamond jewelry. The success of the initial pieces prompted her to start her business, Hulchi Belluni, in 2001. The diamond district of Antwerp, where Ms. Hul’s office and showroom are, is a sharp contrast to its glittering product. Drab gray buildings line the main street, Hoveniersstraat, which has a metal gate, security detail and its own synagogue for the many Jewish people in the industry. Yet the inspiration for Ms. Hul’s designs can come to her here, with the help of her Italian assistant, or almost anywhere. As an example, she offered one of her popular Funghetti rings, which features a circle of pavé diamonds set in a cone of gold resembling a trumpet mushroom. “I was walking in the woods near my house,” she said, when she got the idea. The ring, which comes in a variety of colored stones, is meant to be stacked for a personalized look. A trip she took to Tahiti was about 10 years ago, but it has had a lasting influence: Her Monoi collection, with its pavé diamond petals, echoes the fragrant monoi flower, a species of gardenia that she discovered during the trip. Corsage, with its crisscrossed lacings of pavé diamonds, came about because “I was walking after midnight in Milan and stopped in front of the La Perla windows,” she said. And the Lucky 8 collection is based on the importance of that number in Chinese culture and designed with that market in mind. Her newest collection, Magritte, debuted at Baselworld this year. It was inspired by the marguerite, the French name for the daisy, one of her favorite flowers, as well as a play on the name of the Belgian surrealist painter René Magritte. Ms. Hul’s jewelry is made by hand in Arezzo, Italy; prices start at 900 euros, or $980, and can go up to more than €3 million for commissions. She has created custom pieces for members of Qatar’s royal family, and her work will be displayed at the Jewelry Arabia event this week in Bahrain. It was Ms. Hul’s eye for the latest trend in jewelry that propelled her into the industry. In 1987, she was studying physiotherapy in Antwerp when she began working at Louis Reichman’s famous jewelry store, Juweel Design Barucci, on school vacations. She became a full-time employee and was given more and more responsibility until, eventually, Mr. Reichman asked her to travel to the annual trade fair in Basel, Switzerland, to buy jewelry for the store. He was shocked by her first purchase: heavy, gold Barakà jewelry designed by Lorenzo Muraro, who also designed Ferrari cars. “‘Are you crazy?’” she recalled Mr. Reichman asking. “‘Who is going to buy this?’” Ms. Hul put the 25 pieces in the window and, by closing time, the entire collection had been sold. The next step was obvious: to design her own jewelry. Spirituality, astronomy and feng shui are all important to Ms. Hul: “They influence everything I do,” she said, noting that even the name of her business is her last name combined with “chi,” to produce Hulchi, and Belluni “is for the Italian a bella luna, the beautiful moon.” “A full moon is good luck,” she added.
It had all the trappings of a high-level rapprochement: President-elect Donald J. Trump, now the nation’s press critic in chief, inviting the leading anchors and executives of television news to join him on Monday for a private meeting of minds. On-air stars like Lester Holt, Charlie Rose, George Stephanopoulos and Wolf Blitzer headed to Trump Tower for the off-the-record gathering, typically the kind of event where journalists and politicians clear the air after a hard-fought campaign. Instead, the president-elect delivered a defiant message: You got it all wrong. Mr. Trump, whose antagonism toward the news media was unusual even for a modern presidential candidate, described the television networks as dishonest in their reporting and shortsighted in missing the signs of his upset victory. He criticized some in the room by name, including CNN’s president, Jeffrey A. Zucker, according to multiple people briefed on the meeting who were granted anonymity to describe confidential discussions. It is not unusual for journalists to agree to off-the-record sessions with prominent politicians, including President Obama, as a way to gain insights and develop relationships. But after details of Mr. Trump’s hectoring leaked on Monday in The New York Post, it seemed the meeting was being used as a political prop, especially after Trump-friendly news outlets trumpeted the session as a take-no-prisoners move by a brave president-elect. “Trump Slams Media Elite, Face to Face,” blared the Drudge Report. “Trump Eats Press,” wrote Breitbart News. Those curious to hear more of what the president-elect had to say at the closed-door session were out of luck: Although more than two dozen prominent journalists attended, many declined to comment because they had agreed to keep the proceedings off the record. Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Mr. Trump, described the meeting in more tempered terms. “It was very cordial, very productive, very congenial,” Ms. Conway told reporters at Trump Tower. “It was also very candid and very honest.” “From my own perspective,” she added, “it’s great to hit the reset button.” Still, the encounter crystallized concerns that Mr. Trump, emboldened by his victory, may refuse to abide the traditional dynamic of a president and the journalists who cover him, a naturally adversarial relationship that is nevertheless based on some level of mutual trust. Some media critics questioned why the television networks, which granted Mr. Trump hundreds of hours of free exposure during the campaign, would agree to Monday’s terms. “They learned *nothing* over past 18 months of covering Trump,” tweeted Erik Wemple of The Washington Post. Television is of particular interest to Mr. Trump, who is a keen watcher of morning shows and this past weekend tweeted his displeasure at being mocked on an episode of “Saturday Night Live.” Coverage of Mr. Trump increased ratings and revenue at news networks, even as some executives conceded that, early in the race, the president-elect was granted too much free exposure. By the end of the campaign, Mr. Trump seemed to turn on certain networks and television journalists, in particular CNN, prompting supporters to chant anti-media slogans. Two people briefed on Monday’s meeting said that Mr. Trump seemed well versed in the networks’ ratings increase during the election and did not hesitate to bring the subject up. Mr. Trump is meeting with representatives of several news organizations this week, including The New York Times, where he is scheduled to speak on Tuesday with editors, reporters, columnists and the newspaper’s publisher. Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff; Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump’s daughter; and Ms. Conway are expected to accompany the president-elect to The Times, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting. The meeting was organized at the request of Mr. Trump’s team, Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for The Times, said on Monday. Mr. Trump is expected to speak on the record with Times reporters and columnists; there is also a short off-the-record session planned, which Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, described as “an opportunity to discuss past and future coverage.” As a candidate, and now as president-elect, Mr. Trump has frequently attacked The Times, establishing the paper as a top target in his continuing feud with the media. Mr. Trump often refers to the “failing” New York Times and has threatened to sue the company for libel over an article about two women who accused him of touching them inappropriately years earlier. The Times angered Mr. Trump with some of its unflattering coverage during the campaign, including reports on his taxes, his treatment of women and his legal troubles with Trump University. Since being elected president, he has blasted out more criticisms, using Twitter to disparage the newspaper’s coverage and to claim it had lost “thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the ‘Trump phenomena.’” (The Times disputed that assertion, saying that it had added 41,000 net paid subscriptions for its news products in the week after the election.)
In the new political drama “Miss Sloane,” Jessica Chastain’s titular lobbyist explains how to win in Washington. You have to play your last trump card, she says, right after your opponents play their last trump card. Set for release on Friday, the film is filled with echoes of rhetoric straight from the campaign trail. But in the aftermath of Donald J. Trump’s presidential victory, has the story of a tough woman trying to make a difference in Washington been overtaken by current events? The filmmakers acknowledge that their project plays very differently than it would have had Hillary Clinton defeated Mr. Trump. But they say they can’t control how “Miss Sloane” will be perceived by filmgoers and critics in light of the election outcome. “This is a movie predicated on the idea of surprise,” the thriller’s director, John Madden (“Shakespeare in Love”), said last week. “But few developments could have been more surprising than the election results. For some reason, in film, being upended can be a very pleasurable experience, where in real life it often isn’t.” In the movie, Elizabeth Sloane is a ruthless conservative lobbyist who takes on the National Rifle Association and tries to get gun-control legislation passed. “You’re going to see the film differently through the prism of what’s happened, and it depends on which side of that argument you come from,” Mr. Madden said. “But these are such extraordinarily fluid and provocative times in the world that people’s interest in the political process is either completely exhausted or it’s extremely heightened.” And Ms. Chastain argued in a postelection interview: “I don’t think the movie is going to play to either side of the debate. It’s about a bipartisan bill, and it’s a bipartisan movie.” A two-hour-plus drama about a divisive issue represents a gamble in the superhero-driven marketplace, and the odds against “Miss Sloane” may have increased since Mr. Trump’s victory. “I’m sure they’re very nervous to be releasing a movie with an explicit political theme when the whole political landscape has suddenly changed,” said the film historian Peter Biskind, the author of “Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,” who has not seen the movie. An unexpected resonance with headlines can cut either way for a movie’s box-office prospects. “The China Syndrome” became a hit in 1979 after an accident at the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania moved nuclear-safety issues to the forefront. In more recent years, acts of mass violence may have depressed domestic turnout for films like “A Good Day to Die Hard,” released in 2013 after the Newtown, Conn., school shootings. The longtime Hollywood observer and author Mark Harris (“Pictures at a Revolution”), who has seen “Miss Sloane,” said current events outrun its story in one scene. “There’s a kind of wishfulness to the movie in that it assumes there are still scandals that could potentially demolish someone,” Mr. Harris said. “There’s a climactic moment in the movie that is premised on the belief that people will be shocked by what’s right in front of them. After this last campaign, I’m not sure that’s true.” Perhaps wish fulfillment isn’t the worst marketing strategy for the story of a woman trying to enact huge changes in Washington. “Hopefully, people will feel some catharsis,” Ms. Chastain said. “I see this movement happening now of women, minorities and other people who were surprised by the election’s outcome, and the film works very well for them. It’s like their fantasy world of D.C.” Mr. Madden concurred. “The film is an act of imagination,” he said. “The idea that a piece of gun legislation actually gets onto the table is far away from anything we can conceive, sadly, for the foreseeable future, or even in the last eight years. So in that respect, it is a fantasy.” An experienced female insider whose ethics are questioned, Miss Sloane bears a passing resemblance to Mrs. Clinton. While that wasn’t the intention, Ms. Chastain embraced, on behalf of her character, Mr. Trump’s description of Mrs. Clinton: “such a nasty woman.” “That was originally meant as an insult, then women claimed it and said, ‘It’s O.K. to be ambitious, strong and ruffle feathers,’” Ms. Chastain said. “So Elizabeth is a nasty woman, because for me, a nasty woman is a powerful woman who is overprepared for a debate, knows what she’s doing, is ambitious and not afraid to step forward.” Whatever its commercial reception, “I’m proud of the film,” Ms. Chastain said. “Elizabeth is a good representation of a woman who’s a perfectionist, really good at her job, and vicious — and you can still root for her in the end.” The British-born Mr. Madden has other reasons for optimism. When he attended a screening of the film the night after the election, “I was quite astounded there was anybody in the cinema,” he said. “In my country, those of us who were not happy with the ‘Brexit’ vote wandered around like zombies for three weeks, trying to understand the landscape we found ourselves in. I somehow imagined that might be true here. But people came to the film, and interestingly, they found it a relief.”
WASHINGTON — Senator Tim Kaine’s second-floor office is much as he left it, with a minifridge full of Virginia-made hummus and an iPod playlist heavy on bluegrass and classic rock. The trademark harmonicas have been holstered, at least for now, his audience shrinking from a spellbound national electorate to a spirited weekday gathering of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce. And his campaign plane? It was repurposed this past week to deliver the United States men’s soccer team to a match in Costa Rica, with only one lingering reminder — an H on the tail — of the first female presidential nominee for a major party in American history and the affable dad-jeans, purple-state running mate who traveled the country making her case. “I like feet on the ground,” Mr. Kaine said with a smile this past week, suggesting he was not dwelling on the trappings of temporary fame. He boarded an elevator in the basement of the Capitol, nowhere to go but up. Such is Mr. Kaine’s view from the great election comedown of 2016: that quadrennial moment of humility, electoral grieving and reverse culture shock, foisted upon members of the losing ticket as they resume less glamorous public lives. Secret Service agents are reassigned. Media scrums migrate elsewhere. The junior senator from Virginia is, as it turns out, a heartbeat away from very little. Yet as Mr. Kaine and his party seek to regain their bearings after a stunning loss, he has identified at least one task for himself in the interim: taking his place, as necessary, in the wall of opposition to President-elect Donald J. Trump. “The Democratic Senate minority is about the only emergency brake there is on the train right now,” Mr. Kaine said this past week, adding that the levers of obstruction must be used “judiciously.” “To avoid a disaster,” he added. “You use it to avoid something really bad for the country.” Though fellow Democrats, including aides to Hillary Clinton, have long trumpeted Mr. Kaine’s appeal to multiple constituencies — given his fluency in Spanish, genial manner and eloquence on matters of faith — his role in the party’s long-term future is unclear. Progressive activists have emerged from the election with a conviction that new voices must be elevated. Mr. Kaine, who is up for re-election in 2018, said that he would not seek the presidency or vice presidency in 2020. Liberal stars like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont have delivered stern, rousing addresses about the way forward. No one is clamoring for a Tim Kaine revolution. But as Senate Democrats gird for bruising policy squabbles and confirmation hearings in a Trump administration, they are expected to look to Mr. Kaine with particular urgency on foreign affairs. A member of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, from a state with a major military presence, Mr. Kaine has made foreign policy a priority of his first term in the Senate. He has seized especially the issue of war powers, breaking with President Obama by calling for Congress to provide authorization for military action against the Islamic State. Among his arguments, as he sought to galvanize Democrats: There is no telling who might be president down the line. “With Trump’s maybe erratic foreign policy, his leadership is more important,” Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio said of Mr. Kaine. “I mean, we were sad to lose him,” he added, referring to Mr. Kaine’s now-dashed prospects in the executive branch. “But we wanted to lose him, obviously.” Mr. Kaine’s purpose in recent days has seemed at times more therapeutic than strategic. With emotions still raw, he supplied a measure of catharsis for devastated supporters as he introduced Mrs. Clinton before her concession speech. He said what Mrs. Clinton chose not to — that she had won the popular vote — suggesting that the party’s ideals remained resonant despite the outcome. And he channeled William Faulkner to appraise the collective Democratic psyche. “They killed us,” Mr. Kaine said, “but they ain’t whooped us yet.” Among losing running mates through the years, soul searching has assumed different forms. After the Republican ticket’s defeat in 1976, Hubert H. Humphrey tried to lift the spirits of his despondent friend, Bob Dole, the party’s vice-presidential nominee, with an ice cream outing. After a loss in 1980, former Vice President Walter Mondale went on to be Democrats’ nominee for president in 1984, and lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan. Sarah Palin announced her resignation as Alaska governor eight months after she and Senator John McCain lost the 2008 election. Mr. Kaine, who has communicated occasionally with Mrs. Clinton since the defeat, is accustomed to jarring transitions. He recalled the day of his successor’s inauguration as governor of Virginia in 2010. “They take you home, and they drop you off and then they drive away,” he said. “I had the same feeling this time. Shaking hands with everybody was very emotional, but watching the cars drive away, I had an immense feeling of relief.” His most high-profile turn, a debate with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, attracted a smattering of critics, who chafed at his repeated interruptions of his opponent onstage. Mostly though, Mr. Kaine cultivated an unpretentious image during the campaign, introducing late-night comedy viewers to his assemblage of harmonicas, which remain in his briefcase, and urging voters to choose a “you’re hired” president instead of a “you’re fired” president. He often took the stage with a flurry of less-than-self-conscious gesticulations, like a third-base coach flashing signals, proving proficient at vigorous fist pumps and seemingly indiscriminate crowd-pointing. He once described life as a vice-presidential nominee, playfully, as being “kidnapped.” “The entourage felt cool on occasion,” he said this past week, “but it was never me. So this is more me.” Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, said he expected little change from the “energetically engaged, very well-informed” colleague he had come to know before the election. Mr. Cardin did express a measure of concern about Mr. Kaine’s short-term health. “He’s tired,” Mr. Cardin said. “He needs to gain a little weight back. He lost too much weight. But he’ll get back to his fighting weight.”
This has been a bad year for music legends. First David Bowie, Glenn Frey and Maurice White. Then Prince and George Martin. In the most recent sobering sequence, Leonard Cohen and Leon Russell. We have to face it — rock has grown old. Nothing brings out the indignation of a certain kind of rock ’n’ roll fan like the suggestion that the music of Little Richard, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain and other iconoclasts has aged with its audience. It’s like telling people they are someday going to die — it may be true, but no one wants to hear it, and anyway, why spoil the party? Rock’s core audience was born in the 1950s and ’60s, and its life span has kept expanding. Sixty years after Elvis appeared on “The Ed Sullivan Show,” rock concerts are raking in more money than ever. At the Desert Trip festival in Indio, Calif., last month, about 150,000 tickets were sold for two weekends of shows featuring six legends of 1960s rock — Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Paul McCartney, the Who and Roger Waters — in one place. The headliners were born in the 1940s. The audience was all ages. There were wrinkled hippies and young families. There were college-age backpackers, white-haired fanny-packers and sleepy-eyed six-packers. Many of them had not been old enough to see the Beatles or go to Woodstock, but they were right on time to enjoy (depending on the price of their ticket) comfortable seats, wine vendors and chef-prepared cuisine, and plenty of decent restrooms. I was a long way from sleeping in the mud at Watkins Glen in 1973, waiting for the Band, the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers, and grateful for the improvement. But growing record sales? Not so much. The record business has evaporated for everyone not named Adele. Top 40 radio, which has always been for teenagers, is mostly devoted to post-rock pop and hip-hop. In 2016, rock is not teenage music. Rock is now where jazz was in the early 1980s. Its form is mostly fixed. From Louis Armstrong in the 1920s to Duke Ellington in the ’30s to Charlie Parker in the ’50s to Miles Davis in the ’60s, jazz evolved at superspeed and never looked over its shoulder. In the early 1980s, it began slowing down and looking back. The trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis returned to styles that Davis and Parker had abandoned and showed how much was still there to explore. Jazz moved into Lincoln Center, established a repertoire and assumed its place as “American classical music.” It was no longer controversial or evolving, at least in any popular form. That is where rock finds itself, in a stage of reflection on past glories. Rock-star memoirs are a booming business — Bob Dylan, the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, made it cool with “Chronicles: Volume One” in 2004. This fall, Bruce Springsteen, Robbie Robertson of the Band and the he said-he said Beach Boys Brian Wilson and Mike Love are looking back on long public lives. Rock ’n’ roll as we know it was named in the mid-1950s, born as a mix of black and white musical styles of the Deep South — blues, country and early R&B. A “new” invention, the electric guitar, replaced the horn section. The performer was usually the songwriter, and there was a standard of honesty, autobiography and (to use a word that was swung like a sword of judgment) authenticity in the rock musician that made him more artist than entertainer. In the 1980s rock got a boost from MTV and the compact disc, but the first signs of middle age were already showing. Rock became the soundtrack to Hollywood movies and TV commercials. At the same time, rap began to challenge rock’s domination of mainstream music. After the brief early ’90s insurgency of Nirvana, Pearl Jam and the grunge bands passed, rock became less interested in innovating than in repeating. A popular new rock band tended to sound a lot like beloved old rock bands, and the days when the Beatles moved in three years from the teen pop of “I Want to Hold Your Hand” to the experimentation of “Strawberry Fields Forever” were gone. Certainly, there are rock musicians who push the boundaries of the form. Bjork and P. J. Harvey change the rules with each new album and play to devoted followings — but they don’t fill arenas the way even second-tier bands did in the 1970s and ’80s. The musicians who wish to push rock forward are no longer in the mainstream, and the rock acts remaining there rarely challenge the old rules. It’s easy to imagine that a musician like Annie Clark, who performs as St. Vincent — original, theatrical and a fierce guitar-shredder — would have been a superstar if she had come along between 1966 and 1994. In 2016 she is a critic’s darling with a devoted cult following, sort of like the young jazz powerhouse Kamasi Washington. If rock has settled down, what has taken its disruptive place? Millions of hip-hop fans wait anxiously to see how Kendrick Lamar, Beyoncé and Kanye West will surprise them next. Hip-hop’s audience still rewards innovation. Hip-hop has learned a lot from rock, but hip-hop is not troubled by rock’s self-imposed restrictions. Rap songs have multiple writers and do not glorify instrumental soloists; hip-hop stars do not pretend to be uninterested in commerce. In the late 1980s, when Frank Sinatra was in his 70s — the age the Desert Trip stars are now — white-haired women who had once been bobby-soxers stood at his concerts and shouted, “Frankie, you’ve still got it!” Sinatra, a teen idol, had grown up and grown old with his audience. That is how popular music works. We fall in love with the singers of our youth, and the best of them travel with us through life. Sinatra spent his middle years singing songs like “Last Night When We Were Young” and lyrics about “the autumn of my years.” Dylan in his 50s sang, “It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there.” I was a rock journalist from age 20 to 40 and produced music shows for MTV Networks from 40 to 60. I figured I had enjoyed a front-row seat for the best of it. I assumed that rock was the companion of my generation, and that my children would find a music of their own. My two daughters, born in 1987 and ’88, did as I expected — they progressed from the Spice Girls to Destiny’s Child to 50 Cent to Drake — the voices of their generation. But my son, born in 1994, surprised me. He and his friends were post-MTV, post-Top 40 radio. All the music ever made was on their computers and at their fingertips, and they did not pay attention to boundaries of genre or chronology. Tom Petty led them to the Byrds, which led them to the Everly Brothers. The “Rock Band” game was a steppingstone to Santana, which opened the door to Django Reinhardt. When my son was a teenager we went to the Bonnaroo festival in Tennessee for the Buffalo Springfield reunion and to New Orleans to see Stevie Wonder. My son got to see Prince, Mr. Cohen, Levon Helm, Mose Allison and Allen Toussaint before they died. On Sept. 19 he turned 22 and crossed the biggest remaining hero off his bucket list when he finally saw Tom Waits. Rock ’n’ roll certainly is for old people now. It’s for those young people who want it, too. Like any music that lasts, it’s for anyone who cares to listen. And if in 20 years midlife hip-hop fans are driving through the California desert to see a gray-haired Jay-Z and a balding Eminem? As Frank Sinatra sang when the Beatles were on top, “That’s life.” The only people who want to die before they get old are those too young to know better.

KIEV, Ukraine — Few politicians in the world have had to undergo the same experience twice in their career and in different countries. Yet this is exactly what happened to me in Ukraine and Georgia. I was the president of Georgia for nine years, during which it went from a kleptocracy and failed state to a country that won international recognition for tackling corruption and became one of the easiest places in Europe to conduct business. Named the world’s top reformer by the World Bank in 2006, Georgia became a flagship among the countries of the former Soviet bloc. After my second presidential term in 2013, I left to pursue academic work in the United States for a time, and then returned to Ukraine — where, as a young man, I had spent several years at Kiev University. Responding to calls from my Ukrainian friends to help apply my experience in government, I arrived along with the wave of enthusiasm for reform that followed the Maidan revolution. I offered to work in Odessa, the largest region of Ukraine. It was highly unusual for a former president of another state to serve as a governor in a different country, but the very fate of Ukrainian statehood was at stake in Odessa. The province was not only riddled with local mafia groups infamous for their thuggishness, but it was also threatened by the conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the east. Odessa borders the breakaway region of Transnistria in Moldova, which is controlled by Moscow-backed separatists and Russian armed forces. I brought with me a group of professionals from my previous government, who started to overhaul Ukraine’s police force and helped to lead the country’s first anti-corruption agency. The reform of the police force was an immediate popular success, while the new anti-graft agency established several high-profile investigations. We seemed to have the encouragement of Ukraine’s president to push ahead. The city of Odessa was recovering from the clashes of May 2, 2014, with pro-Russian militants, in which scores of people were killed. Focusing on reconstruction and reform, I opened a competitive process to recruit the most talented Western-educated professionals to fill the leadership positions in district administrations. I created an economic development board to help local businessmen circumvent crooked officials in state agencies, and I invited Yulia Marushevska, a prominent young Maidan activist, to clean up Odessa’s customs service, which was notorious for bribery and kickbacks. We began a program of repairing roads and other infrastructure. We worked hard to raise standards in public services to new levels and restore security to the region. As the reform movement picked up pace and gained popularity, we suddenly ran into resistance where we least expected it — from people in prominent positions in government back in the capital, Kiev. The first sign of trouble was when I had to confront the then prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, over evidence of corruption involving government officials at a chemical plant in Odessa, one of the largest state-owned enterprises of its kind. Starting in January, I toured the country to publicize our anti-corruption “Cleaning Up Ukraine” movement in order to put pressure on the country’s leaders to put a stop to this graft by Ukraine’s ultrarich. In March, Ukraine’s Parliament voted to remove the prosecutor general, and the following month, the prime minister resigned. Ukraine’s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, pledged to crack down on the old practices and bring in greater transparency. That was more than seven months ago, yet we have not seen any major changes. There was no big clear-out of the cronies. I was left, instead, with the impression that local leaders of the president’s party were working to undermine the anti-corruption efforts. My administration was starved of funding for months, the appointment of several of my key deputies has been stalled, and some of our most able reformers have quit in frustration. Ms. Marushevska, the customs agency head whom I appointed, said she was harassed with trumped-up official reprimands. Similar tactics were used by the prosecutor general’s office, which raided the office of one of my advisers. Despite these aggressive searches, no charges have been filed. The final straw for me came when the online disclosures of Ukrainian officials’ personal wealth, the so-called e-declarations, were published last month. Here were the very public servants with whom I had to work on a daily basis shamelessly declaring the millions of dollars they had stashed under their mattresses. It was the decades-long rule of this post-Soviet kleptocratic elite that turned this potentially wealthy nation into one of the poorest countries in Europe. Ukraine need not be poor, but corrupt officials have systematically pillaged the country, robbing Ukrainians of the prosperity that should be theirs. While Ukraine’s soldiers are on the front line, heroically defending their country from Russian aggression, Ukraine’s elite keeps stripping the country of all it has left. In their lifestyle and mentality, Ukraine’s kleptocrats are identical to their counterparts in Russia’s oligarchy. The final freedom for Ukraine would be to free it not just from Russian aggression but also from the Russian-style political class that holds Ukraine back from its European aspirations. Back in 2001, after failing to persuade Georgia’s president, Eduard Shevardnadze, to force through meaningful reforms and get rid of his corrupt entourage, I resigned from the government. I went on to found Georgia’s United National Movement, which led to the 2003 Rose Revolution, which finally brought real reform to Georgia. The success of Georgia’s revolution served as an inspiration to many of the Maidan activists of 2014 in Ukraine. Just as with Mr. Shevardnadze, I’ve been severely disappointed with Mr. Poroshenko’s apparent inability to see that the status quo is unsustainable. Ukraine needs real change, not an imitation of it. Today, many of the reform initiatives we began have come to a halt. Just this week, Ms. Marushevska resigned from her post. After my repeat experience here, I decided to resign to found a new political party in Ukraine. This is an amazing country, full of hard-working, educated and talented people who deserve a much better future. Its greatest resource is the young, educated Ukrainians who, given the opportunity, would become effective, honest public servants and political leaders, eager to rid the country of corruption. Until now, Ukraine’s old corrupt establishment has discouraged and blocked these young reformers from assuming leadership positions in the public sector. I am pledged to help change that.
LOD, Israel — It would be easy to miss the mosque in a temporary building with a concrete floor and corrugated roof. But it is impossible to miss the constellation of six loudspeakers atop a giant metal structure resembling the Eiffel Tower. Five times a day, starting well before dawn, these loudspeakers broadcast the muezzin’s call to prayer in Lod, a city of Arabs and Jews near Ben-Gurion International Airport, and therein lies one more friction point in a country full of them. One group’s expression of faith is another’s noise pollution, and Israel’s government is planning a crackdown. A proposal backed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and initially endorsed this week by his ministers would authorize the government to ban the use of loudspeakers by mosques and other houses of worship across Israel. For many on both sides of the nation’s sectarian line, few questions could prove more provocative than whether the muezzin should be muzzled. “The call to prayer is a symbol of Islam,” said Adel Elfar, the imam of the Lod mosque, one of several that have been controversial here. “This is something that’s existed for 1,426 years.” He said that he could hear bells from a Christian church in town and that Jewish residents drove around the city every couple of months broadcasting from loudspeakers on their vehicles. “The call of every religion, if you get rid of extremism, shouldn’t bother anybody,” he added. And yet it does. Among those bothered is Lod’s mayor, Yair Revivo, who is Jewish and announced last month that the city would broadcast the Shema, a central prayer that begins “Hear O Israel,” to counter the mosques’ call. The first of Islam’s five daily prayers begins before dawn, noted Col. Motti Yogev, a member of Parliament who introduced the new ban. “The goal of the law is to prevent people’s sleep from being disturbed,” he said. “We have no desire to harm the prayer of the Muslims.” The fight over the muezzin underscores a fundamental societal challenge for Israel beyond its conflict with Palestinians living in Gaza or the occupied West Bank. About 20 percent of Israel’s citizens are Arabs, and cities like Lod, where about a third of the nearly 73,000 residents are Arab, perennially struggle to find a comfortable balance. The conflict has also grown in Jerusalem, which is divided between largely Jewish and Arab communities. The proposed ban, approved on Sunday by Mr. Netanyahu’s ministers and sent to Parliament, has drawn denunciations from Jordan and the Palestinian Authority. In a sign of the complexity of the issue, it drew surprise opposition on Tuesday from Israel’s ultra-Orthodox health minister, Yaakov Litzman, who temporarily blocked parliamentary debate and sent the issue back to the ministers because it might also affect the use of sirens to announce the beginning of the Jewish Sabbath. Ahmad Tibi, a leader of the Arab members of the Israeli Parliament, or Knesset, said Mr. Netanyahu was inflaming anti-Muslim sentiments. “If the muezzin law passes the Knesset, I call on the Arab public in Israel to rise up; I call for a civil popular uprising,” he told a Lebanese television outlet. “All Muslims must be called to protect mosques, to defend the calls from the mosques.” Amnon Beeri-Sulitzeanu of the Abraham Fund Initiatives, a nonprofit organization that promotes coexistence between Jews and Arabs, said the proposal conflicted with Mr. Netanyahu’s recent drive to increase investment in Arab communities to reduce gaps in educational and economic opportunities. “You see those two conflicting trends yet again, which basically tells me that the Israeli establishment still hasn’t made up its mind in regard to its Arab citizens,” he said. “What do we want from the Arab Palestinian minority? Do we want to really integrate it and include it as an integrated part of Israeli society?” The text of the proposed ban on mosque loudspeakers says that “hundreds of thousands of citizens” in parts of Israel “suffer habitually and daily from loud and unreasonable noise that is caused by the call of muezzin from mosques.” Colonel Yogev said it could be narrowed to apply only to sleeping hours. Mr. Netanyahu has said he is trying to balance competing interests. “Israel is committed to freedom for all religions, but is also responsible for protecting citizens from noise,” he said this week. In Lod, which traces its history to the days of Canaan, frustration over the mosques has grown as more Jewish residents have moved in since the evacuation of settlements in Gaza a decade ago. There is already a noise law on the books, but advocates of the new legislation said it was not applied to the muezzin. “If someone is having a karaoke party with loudspeakers at night and you call the police, they will come and take down the loudspeakers,” said Amichai Langfeld, a member of the City Council. “But if you call about the mosque, they won’t.” Under existing law, Mr. Langfeld added, the police must test the level of the call to prayer — or of any noise — to see if it exceeded the limit. The new law would simply ban loudspeakers. At Mr. Elfar’s mosque, the call to prayer was broadcast on Tuesday at 4:45 a.m., 11:25 a.m., 2:21 p.m., 4:47 p.m. and 6:05 p.m. The tension over the loudspeakers was easy to detect in a visit to a clothes and jewelry market a few blocks away. Several Jewish shoppers and salespeople said that they did not mind the call during daylight hours, but that the earliest one invariably woke them up. Some described trying to muffle the noise with curtains or blankets, often to little effect. Naama Reichmann, 32, who moved to Lod about five years ago, said the 4:45 a.m. call made it hard for her and her 2-year-old daughter to sleep through the night. “We don’t say they can’t do it, but not so loud,” she said. Chaim Koti, 80, who was selling clothes, was more pointed. “They do it intentionally loud in order to bother us,” he said. A few feet away, a group of Muslim vendors said the proposal to limit the muezzin was a slap in the face to them. They noted that the call to prayer had been sounded in Lod since long before Mr. Netanyahu came to power. “There’s hate for Arabs,” said Muhyi Sharabati, 22. “There are people who are against Islam.” Safiya Matweeye, 19, said the authorities should focus on crime and violence instead of things that could discourage prayer. “It’s a good thing, because people come to pray instead of shooting each other in the street,” she said. “Religion keeps people honest.” As they spoke, the afternoon call to prayer sounded. No one looked up. After a few minutes, it was over, the latest trumpet in Israel’s culture war.
BEIJING — The founder of a Chinese brand of high-tech toilets called Trump said he had no intention of soiling the name of America’s next president. Zhong Jiye, the founder, said he had not heard of Donald J. Trump when he registered the English name of his company, Shenzhen Trump Industrial Company Limited, as a trademark in 2002. In Chinese, the company name means “innovate universally,” he said, highlighting how the toilet seats warm and wash the user’s backside. That Chinese name, he explained, also sounds a little like “trump.” “We really didn’t know of this person called Trump,” Mr. Zhong said in a telephone interview from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen. “It was entirely a coincidence.” In the United States, Mr. Trump’s name has adorned ties, steaks, water and other products. In China, it is found on computers, cosmetics, even leather goods. The difference: Many such Chinese products don’t have the president-elect’s permission. Of the 46 registered trademarks under the Trump name in China, 29 appear to be owned by Mr. Trump, based on data with the country’s trademark office. At least 14 companies not associated with Mr. Trump applied for the Trump trademark in 2015 and 2016 alone, according to Itaotm, a Chinese commercial trademark website. The situation highlights the difficulties that big brands and celebrities face as they navigate the country’s relatively new trademark laws. In China, trademarks are generally awarded to those who are first to file with the government. That has given rise to a crush of people registering the names of well-known brands, in a practice known as “trademark squatting.” Many Western companies like Apple and Starbucks have been caught up in long legal battles to win the right to use their names in China. In May, a Chinese company won the right to sell its leather goods under the iPhone trademark after years of legal wrangling with Apple. Michael Jordan lost the rights to the name he is known by in China. New Balance paid $16 million in damages for what a court said was the illegal use of the Chinese name for the company, which a person had trademarked. “It’s very difficult to prove bad faith,” said Matthew Dresden, a lawyer with Harris Moure in Seattle who specializes in Chinese intellectual property law. “It’s very hard to prove that your name is well known at the time that the application is filed.” Mr. Trump has fought at least once to get his name back. In 2015, he lost a legal battle against a businessman in the northern province of Liaoning, Dong Wei, to prevent him from using the Trump name for a construction company, according to a website run by China’s Supreme Court. Then the decision was reversed. A notice issued on China’s trademark office website on Sunday said that Mr. Trump’s trademark had been granted preliminary approval for use in construction services. The Wall Street Journal reported the decision on Monday. Alan Garten, general counsel of the Trump Organization, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Mr. Trump isn’t the first world leader wrapped up in a name dispute in China. In 2004, the country’s government officials were not favorably inclined when a Chinese businessman tried to register the Chinese name of former President George W. Bush for a brand of disposable diapers. The officials said the application was likely to be rejected “because it may bring about bad social impact if a leader’s name is registered as a trademark,” according to state media. Mr. Zhong, of the toilet maker Shenzhen Trump, said he had not received a challenge from Mr. Trump or his company. Still, he said, he “will never” give up his trademark easily, if Mr. Trump decides to sue. “Litigating is his right,” Mr. Zhong said. “But we will let the government make its judgment. We believe the country’s laws will protect businesses like us.” Mr. Zhong said he approved of Mr. Trump’s “courageous style and spirit of reform.” He also liked Mr. Trump’s “innovative ideas.” When asked about the criticism directed toward Mr. Trump in the United States, Mr. Zhong said, “Democratic countries are like that. I think a transformation is not bad at all.”
On Sunday afternoon, the composer Lei Liang looked on silently as the ensemble Loadbang made its second pass through his “Lakescape V.” For seven years a commission from the busy Mr. Liang had been on a wish list kept by the group, an unusual quartet consisting of trumpet, trombone, bass clarinet and baritone voice. It became a fixed point on the calendar nearly three years ago, when a concert of Mr. Liang’s music was scheduled for Thursday, part of the Miller Theater’s Composer Portrait series. But the musicians received their parts only several weeks ago and the coaching by the composer gave them just five days to close the distance between written page and performance. “That’s right!” Mr. Liang exclaimed after clarifying the articulation of the opening, an effect like the passing of granular hail through funnel clouds. “This time I can hear the particles swirling around.” Sounds that have long occupied the imagination must eventually make the leap to flesh and bone, wood and brass. The materials of “Lakescape V,” a departure from its more tranquil “Lakescape” series forerunners, have had an even greater distance across which to spring. They are a conceptual shift from earlier Liang works, including some selected for his Portrait concert: “Serashi Fragments” (2005), a string quartet inspired by a Mongolian chaorer (two-stringed fiddle); “Ascension” (2008), a rollicking brass quintet with percussion; and “Luminous” (2014), a concerto for the dexterous contrabass player Mark Dresser recently released on New World Records. In the past, Mr. Liang’s works often focused on storytelling, frequently reconstructing memories of his native China. The saxophone concerto “Xiaoxiang,” a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2015, was inspired by the tale of a villager whose husband was killed by a Communist official during the Cultural Revolution. This emphasis on storytelling hasn’t changed in “Lakescape V.” But the technology that Mr. Liang encountered during a three-year residency from 2013-16 at the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology’s Qualcomm Institute fundamentally shifted his perception of space. “Think of it like a bird that can fly into a painting, like the animated perspective of a drone,” he explained in an interview, describing his new style. “You can look at something very closely — or pull away. You can create swift transitions between what you choose to see.” For “Hearing Landscapes” (2015), Mr. Liang worked alongside a team of Qualcomm Institute engineers whose robotic imager scanned paintings by the Chinese artist Huang Binhong (1865-1955), a master at creating the illusion of depth. Extremely high-resolution scans — more than four billion pixels, enough to fill 2,000 HD televisions at native resolution — give viewers the sense of penetrating two-dimensional surfaces and being immersed in the painting, as in virtual reality. “I felt like I was standing on a mountain,” Mr. Liang said of the first time he saw one of the paintings projected at the institute. Using multichannel speakers, “Hearing Landscapes” tried to transform this visual experience into an aural one. Mr. Liang continues to explore the kind of multiple, shifting perspectives that evoke the scanner’s joystick navigation, as in a coming commission for the Boston Modern Orchestra Project. Listening to Loadbang’s rehearsal of “Lakescape V,” delicate multiphonic notes built up layers of pitches. Duos shimmered over musical drones. A section called “Composing the wind” explored air sounds, altering a listener’s sense of the space around the instruments, tracing their serpentine tubing. Then the showers of particles returned: deconstructed syllables from a poem in Mandarin by Wai-Lim Yip. “‘Fei’ is the word for ‘fly,’” Mr. Liang explained to the musicians. “‘Out of darkness we fly.’ There’s a leap. It’s transcendent.”
Mose Allison, a pianist, singer and songwriter who straddled modern jazz and Delta blues, belonging to both styles even as he became a touchstone for British Invasion rockers and folksy troubadours, died on Tuesday at his home in Hilton Head, S.C. He was 89. His death was confirmed by the singer and songwriter Amy Allison, his daughter. Mr. Allison began his professional career as a piano player, at a time when his style — percussive and jaunty, carried along by a percolating beat — suited the sound of the jazz mainstream. In addition to leading his own trio, he worked with some of the major small-group bandleaders of the late 1950s, including the saxophonists Stan Getz and Gerry Mulligan. But he found greater success, and a singular niche, as a singer of his plain-spoken, pungently observant songs, beginning in the early ’60s. For the next 50 years he worked almost exclusively as the leader of his own groups. Mr. Allison used his cool, clear voice to conversational effect, with an easy blues inflection that harked back to his upbringing in rural Mississippi. Backing himself at the piano, he favored a loose call and response between voice and instrument, or between right and left hands, often taking tangents informed by the complex harmonies and rhythmic feints of bebop. His artistic persona, evident in his stage manner as well as his songs, suggested a distillation of folk wisdom in a knowing but unpretentious package. He was especially revered by 1960s English rockers who idolized the blues, and who saw in his example an accessible ideal. John Mayall recorded “Parchman Farm,” Mr. Allison’s ironic adaptation of a prison blues; so did the English rhythm-and-blues singer Georgie Fame. Other songs by Mr. Allison found their way onto albums by the Yardbirds, the Kinks and the Clash. The Who based their world-beating anthem “My Generation” partly on his “Young Man Blues,” which the band also featured as the opening track on its 1970 album, “Live at Leeds.” Mr. Allison’s tunes were covered almost as widely by his fellow Americans, including the blues artists Paul Butterfield and Johnny Winter, the country-soul singer Bobbie Gentry and, more recently, the jazz vocalist and pianist Diana Krall. The Pixies, a pace-setting alternative-rock band, named an album track “Allison” in his honor. In a 1986 interview with the pianist Ben Sidran, conducted for NPR, Mr. Allison grouped his material into three categories: slapstick, social comment and personal crisis. “Sometimes,” he added, “all three of those elements wind up in a tune.” Many of his songs inhabit an air of wry amusement or exasperated skepticism, often pivoting on a single phrase. He skewered hypocrisies in “Everybody’s Cryin’ Mercy,” recorded by Bonnie Raitt, and mastered the sardonic put-down in “Your Mind Is on Vacation (And Your Mouth Is Working Overtime),” covered by Elvis Costello. For all of his elder-statesman eminence in rock, Mr. Allison never stopped seeing himself as a jazz artist. “My definition of jazz is music that’s felt, thought and performed simultaneously,” he said in “Ever Since I Stole the Blues,” a 2006 BBC documentary. “And that’s what I’m looking for every night.” Mose John Allison Jr. was born on Nov. 11, 1927, on a family cotton farm near Tippo, Miss. His mother taught elementary school and his father, a self-taught stride piano player, owned a general store. A service station across the road had a jukebox, on which Mr. Allison heard blues singers like Memphis Minnie and Tampa Red. He began taking piano lessons at 5 and was playing in bands as a young teenager — around the same time he wrote his first song, “The 14-Day Palmolive Plan,” a satirical jab at radio commercials in the style of the saxophonist, singer and bandleader Louis Jordan’s jump blues. His main hero then was Nat King Cole, a well-regarded jazz pianist who had begun singing with his trio in a smoothly urbane style. For a while Mr. Allison also played the trumpet, on local gigs and, after he joined the Army in 1946, with the 179th Army Ground Forces Band. He had put in a year at the University of Mississippi before his service, and he briefly returned to Ole Miss — one reason, perhaps, for his sobriquet “the William Faulkner of jazz,” popularized by Mr. Sidran. But he soon lost interest in his chosen field, chemical engineering. He ended up graduating from Louisiana State University with an English degree and then briefly worked the Southern club circuit. Moving to New York City in 1956, Mr. Allison found work as a jazz pianist, initially with the saxophonist Al Cohn. He joined a successful quintet led by Mr. Cohn and his fellow saxophonist Zoot Sims. His style had evolved, in line with modernists like Lennie Tristano and Thelonious Monk, but he still had a trace of the South in his earthy attack, and in his untroubled relationship with blues inflection. Mr. Allison recorded his debut album, “Back Country Suite,” for Prestige in 1957. A song cycle for piano trio inspired by his down-home roots, it was well reviewed but not a great commercial success. The same was true of “Local Color,” his second album, which introduced “Parchman Farm.” At the time, his unorthodox musical blend often ran up against preconceived notions of style. “In the South, I’m considered an advanced bebop type,” he told DownBeat magazine in 1958. “In New York, I’m considered a country blues-folk type. Actually, I don’t think I’m either. Maybe I’m a little of both.” Still, his star rose enough for him to be signed by Columbia Records, which in 1960 released “The Transfiguration of Hiram Brown,” an ambitious suite with a loosely autobiographical theme: the excitement and disillusionment of a young man who has moved from the country to the city. (Mr. Allison later returned to this subject on “If You’re Going to the City,” a signature tune.) But “Transfiguration” produced middling sales; Prestige did far better with a 1963 compilation of his vocal sides, simply titled “Mose Allison Sings.” By that time, Mr. Allison’s move to Atlantic Records had begun to sharpen his reputation as a singer and songwriter. His first album for the label, “I Don’t Worry About a Thing,” released in 1962, introduced several of his best-known tunes, including the title track, a blues that deflates its own trite expression with a caustic addendum: “’Cause I know nothing’s going to be all right.” When Atlantic released “The Word From Mose” in 1964, the album cover featured a memorable tagline next to Mr. Allison’s photograph: “Words of wisdom from the jazz sage.” Rather than make a pop or rhythm-and-blues album for the label, Mr. Allison stuck to his hybrid style, and his relatively modest commercial profile. He settled down on Long Island, where he lived for more than 40 years with his family before moving to Hilton Head Island. In addition to his daughter Amy, Mr. Allison is survived by his wife of 65 years, Audre; two other daughters, Janine and Alissa Allison; a son, John; and two grandchildren. While Mr. Allison released fewer albums from the mid-1970s on, he never stopped writing songs, in his dryly satirical vein. The title track of one album in the ’80s was “Middle Class White Boy.” A later album — released in the early 1990s, when he was 66 — opens with “Certified Senior Citizen,” followed by its incredulous pushback, “This Ain’t Me.” For many years Mr. Allison kept up a busy touring schedule, typically with a trio. He reached some of his biggest audiences as an opening act for Van Morrison, who in 1996 made the album “Tell Me Something: The Songs of Mose Allison,” with Mr. Sidran and Mr. Fame. (Mr. Allison turned up as a guest on a couple of tracks.) Mr. Allison’s final studio album, “The Way of the World,” was released on the British independent label Anti- in 2010. Produced by Joe Henry, who had coaxed him out of semiretirement, it finds him in an autumnal but still trenchant frame of mind, despite plaints to the contrary on the opening tune, “My Brain.” The title track, set at a saunter, has the bittersweet resignation of an old man taking stock of what he’s seen. A live album recorded in 2006, “Mose Allison American Legend, Live in California,” was released in 2015. In recent years Mr. Allison stopped performing but kept receiving accolades. A marker with his name and biographical details was added to the Mississippi Blues Trail in 2012. The next year, he was recognized as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, the highest honor for jazz musicians. At the induction ceremony in Manhattan, Mr. Allison accompanied his daughter Amy at the piano in a version of his ballad “Was.” A parlor waltz with connotations both mortal and memorial, it begins with some verb-tense wordplay, quickly turning poignant:
In the week since Donald J. Trump’s election as president of the United States, much has been written about the potential conflicts of interest a sitting president with a global business may encounter (among other things). Less attention, however, has been paid to the even fuzzier situation of the close family members of a sitting president, and their business interests — though on Monday, it became clear that this is another potential minefield, at least when it comes to the first daughter Ivanka Trump and a brand that is largely built on her image. A group of journalists, including reporters at The New York Times and Vogue, received an email from Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, the upscale brand Ms. Trump founded in 2007, entitled “Style Alert” and touting “Ivanka Trump wearing her favorite bangle from the Metropolis Collection on ‘60 Minutes.’” The bangle, a gold-and-diamond bracelet that costs $10,800 on her website, was clearly pictured on her wrist during her interview with her father, stepmother and grown siblings with Lesley Stahl on Sunday night. Such emails are not uncommon among fashion brands, which tend to trumpet every celebrity sighting in their products to the world at large. What was different about this email, however, was that it came not from the communications office, but from the vice president for sales, the person in a brand who would generally work with a company’s wholesale partners (in Ms. Trump’s case, stores such as Neiman Marcus in Georgia, Florida and Illinois, and Charles Schwartz & Son in Washington, D.C.). And that after pointing out the bracelet, it urged recipients to “Please share this with your clients.” In other words, it used Ms. Trump’s appearance by her father’s side to directly promote the selling of her products. When reached, Monica Marder, the vice president, said repeatedly, “I am not available for comment,” and then, when asked if she had sent the email, hung up the phone. But a day later, Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said: “This notification was sent by a well-intentioned marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary protocol, and who, like many of us, is still making adjustments post-election. We are proactively discussing new policies and procedures with all of our partners going forward.” This is not the first time Ms. Trump’s brands have used her role in her father’s political career for marketing purposes. In July, Ms. Trump wore a dress from her own collection to introduce her father at the Republican National Convention (she also wore her own brand shoes and jewelry). The next day, her company tweeted out a picture of her from the podium with the words “Shop Ivanka’s look from her #RNC speech” and a link to the Macy’s website, where a similar style from the brand was offered. The $138 dress reportedly sold out in a day. At the time, the decision was met with some opprobrium, even though the stakes were lower. Mr. Trump has stated that his children will have no formal roles in his White House, because they will be running his business, and there is no law that prohibits presidential relatives from continuing their own business, though Section 713 of Title 18 of the United States Code forbids the use of likenesses of the presidential seal for promotional purposes. Ms. Trump has not come close to that, but the appearance is still ethically blurred. Whether or not Ms. Trump knew of the bracelet email before it was sent, her name is still on the top of the alert. In the past, attempts by relatives to profit from a connection to a president, such as Billy Carter’s introduction of Billy Beer during his brother Jimmy’s administration, and the creation of Roger Clinton’s band, Politics, during his half brother Bill’s terms in office, were roundly deemed inappropriate. The tension between Ms. Trump’s position on her father’s transition team and her unofficial, but powerful, role as a representative of women and the younger generation in his organization, and the fact that she is her own best ad and her brand is thus understandably using her as a celebrity, makes the issue even more complicated, and it underscores her status in the public eye and the amount of attention she will incur. The question now is how she uses it.
Since 23 June, the choice to leave the European Union has been debated in Britain largely as if it were a reflexive action – something the nation does to itself. But Brexit must also be understood transitively – something this country does to other countries. Naturally, domestic considerations dominate the discussion, especially since separation talks have not begun. But as the outline of those negotiations comes into view, it is essential that more attention is given to perspectives from across the channel. That picture is far from simple. The EU position will combine the interests of individual member states and the priorities of supra-national institutions, as David Davis had occasion to remember on a trip to Brussels last week. The Brexit secretary met Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who will represent the European parliament in the divorce negotiations.MEPs must approve any final agreement and they cannot be expected to rubber-stamp anything. No EU leader welcomes the imposition of Brexit on to an already difficult agenda. France, the Netherlands and Germany all hold elections next year in which European solidarity will be corroded by insurgent nationalism. A constitutional referendum in Italy next week could destroy the government there. The eurozone debt crisis is in remission, not cured. This context makes the UK’s negotiating position weaker in two ways. First, embattled governments are disinclined to make time for British concerns. Second, a perception that Brexit is one of many forces conspiring to undo the whole European project strengthens the feeling that Britain cannot be seen to be rewarded for an act of destabilising, unilateral adventurism. That is the view taken by the commission’s lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, who also met Mr Davis. Mr Barnier said the encounter was a “courtesy visit” granted at the Brexit secretary’s request – a formulation that underlines EU officials’ refusal to be drawn into any substantial discussion before article 50 is triggered.There is a tendency in Britain to caricature “Brussels” as a single entity that can be made to dispense concessions. But Brexit cannot be understood as one deal between the UK and the EU, because the EU itself is a negotiated entity – a complex system with multiple points of power and shifting internal dynamics. It is a process not a place.There is also a complacent British habit of thinking that leaders from big countries can override fiddly EU diplomacy in ad hoc deals. David Cameron vastly overestimated Angela Merkel’s capacity to influence the outcome of his failed attempt to renegotiate membership. That mistake is repeated in the minds of Brexiters who think that economic interests – the need to retain access to UK markets for German exporters – will trump all other considerations. Their presumption ignores the premium that all EU governments, and Germany’s in particular, place on the long-term integrity of the European project. It does not matter that Theresa May’s stated intent is for a mutually beneficial trading arrangement.In principle, any Brexit is hostile to the interests of those with whom she wants to do a deal. This problem must be better communicated to the British public, not just to prepare people for inevitable compromise but because the negotiations won’t make any sense without recognition that the rest of the EU perceives itself to be mitigating an existential threat. Lord Kerr, the former British diplomat who helped draft article 50, sagely advised ministers this week to let MPs consider a green paper explaining “to the country what the choices are and what the upsides and downsides are of the various [Brexit] options”.The cost-benefit equation of Brexit for Britain has so far been formulated only in economic terms. This week’s autumn statement brought the fiscal implications of an uncertain future into sharp relief. That has revived speculation about a national change of heart; perhaps a second referendum as mooted separately by Tony Blair and John Major this week. Their voices can easily be dismissed by Brexiters as anguished cries from an ancien regime, unworthy of attention in the revolutionary world post-referendum. But the former prime ministers’ observation that voters are yet to confront the real cost of what is in store, and that their opinions might shift, is unarguably true. As the talks draw nearer, it will become clearer that the UK is not only imposing a financial penalty on itself but forcing a burden on essential allies at a time when the international order looks precarious enough already.TopicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionForeign policyDavid DavisTheresa MayTony BlaireditorialsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Thanks for getting involved today in a broad discussion involving Donald Trump, Brexit and a northern “brain drain” in the UK. We’ll be back next week with another opportunity to discuss the week’s news and features with our journalists below the line, but in the meantime you can get in touch with any feedback. Email sarah.marsh@theguardian.com or matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with suggestions, or continue the conversation below, where we’ll also be checking in. Have a great weekend.Lastly from us today, we’ll leave you with this: random hugs all round!   normanshovel 25 November 2016 4:21pmIf you ever feel like you're have the joy of being alive suffocated out of you by nihilistic journalism and opinion pieces, one thing that's worth hanging on to: I've met a lot of middle class liberal Guardian reading types recently, they're alright if you know how to take them, can be a bit weird and intense about some things, but they are not that much different from everyone else. My advice , if you're coming home from work and you spot a MCLG-type, give them a random hug. It doesn't matter how sweaty or work-dirty you are, just do it!Thanks Norman. Each week we ask our team of moderators to highlight a conversation they enjoyed reading or felt was particularly constructive or interesting.First today was the discussion below a news article after it was announced that the UK was to censor online videos of “non-conventional” sex acts.

London for one reader wasn’t paved with gold    Terence Cass 25 November 2016 4:02pmMy experience in living in "London" for short periods in Lewisham, Golders Green and Selsdon was that most people lived in their own enclave . The idea of "living in London" seemed far from the truth. I did have a stepson who gave up his job as a supervisor in Tescos in Northants where he could have afforded a nice flat to go to London so he could go to the top clubs like Ministry of Sound. For that he lived in a room no bigger than a coffin. he had to put his bedside table on the bed to open or close the door. how many in London like him? In September, Fabric had its licence revoked following the deaths of two 18-year-olds who took ecstasy while at the venue. Three months later, after an impressive campaign from the nightlife community, the club is set to reopen. Fabric nightclub to reopen under strict new licensing conditions Read moreA deal was struck between Fabric, the Met and Islington council. It’s not plain sailing though; Fabric has agreed to 32 conditions that include new ID scanning systems, enhanced searching, covert surveillance within the club, lifetime bans for anyone found in possession of drugs and no entry for anyone under 19. The licensing conditions are evidence that the council and police still prioritise a “zero-tolerance” approach to drugs in clubs (which, let’s be honest, is probably impossible to ever achieve) over anything else, such as pragmatically improving the safety of those inside.   Photograph: Carl Court/Getty ImagesWhether clubbers will care to enter a venue that has to enforce a draconian level of security simply to listen to music and dance will be the biggest worry for Fabric’s management. On a more positive note, London (and the UK’s) nightlife community has never seemed more focused and active; Fabric’s closure provoked real action. But while the club may be set to reopen, do you feel that London’s nightlife has been saved?  Leaving the north of England for London is, for some, the only way to find work – that is according to a new study that says there is a “brain drain” from the north, with 310,000 graduates moving south in the last decade.The great northern brain drain: 'I daydream about moving back' Read moreReaders shared their experiences above the line in this article commissioned to further tell the story, and there was lively debate after it was published – many of you also telling stories of moving the other way.‘London’s great for the weekend, up north is better for an asthmatic’   Lazyasalurcher 21 November 2016 10:00pmLived in London (well, one of the suburbs at the end of the Met line) most of my life. Loved the city, the food, the nightlife, the culture etc.Moved up north, miss the things that make London great. Don't miss the traffic, the pollution, the crush of people on the tube. Love the walks in the countryside up here, love the accent.London's great for the weekend, up north is better for a middle aged wheezing asthmatic with an energetic hound.‘Organizations need to get their HQs out of London’   ksquared 21 November 2016 8:48pmOrganizations need to get their HQs OUT of London. All those charities REALLY don't need to be there. They can have a small media/advocacy office that they share with other orgs and move the entire rest of their staff somewhere cheaper. In the meantime they are wasting their supporters' money on London wages and rents, and doing nothing to support a better economic balance in this country. Drives me crazy.‘I’d love to move back to Manchester’   Erica9 21 November 2016 8:26pmI'd love to move back to Manchester. The reminder that our mayor is a former "Mr Gay UK" just made me well up with pride. An affordable, liberal city with character.

It wasn't labelled a brain drain though, so presumably they were all thicko's going in that direction;)What do you think – have you made the move? Would you? If you aren’t from the UK, have you noticed a similar debate about so-called “brain drain” to or from the capital? And on that “no publicity is bad publicity” point raised by another reader below:   feliciafarrel 25 November 2016 2:59pmIs there no such thing as bad publicity for Trump?During the election campaign, because of the huge animosity to Hillary (and Obama) it was probably true that all publicity was good publicity for Trump. That's not going to be the case once he takes office. Unfortunately I think he knows it, and already he is moderating his tone and output.   kizbot 25 November 2016 2:56pmThere is no such thing as bad publicity in many ways... look at all the sleb careers built on it... Trump obviously thinks being Prez is a bit like being a Kardashian or Paris Hilton... A couple of your comments on Trump vs the media, now:   Tystnaden 25 November 2016 2:20pmWhatever he's selling, the media are buying.Corruption within the Trump foundation? Nah, let's report on Pence getting booed at Hamilton instead, because, you know, clicks. Trump's long history of corruption and dodgy dealing? Nah, let's report disproportionately on Hillary's non-scandal and treat Trump like a joke. The media did as much as anybody to elect Trump during this election.   KTBFFH 25 November 2016 2:49pmUntil people who voted remain at least try to acknowledge that some of the British population may have a valid reason for voting to leave the EU, we're never going to get back to more progressive politicsWith regard to this quoted passage above the line, it mirrors similar claims made about many of those who voted Brexit or Trump. The thing is that I still haven't heard an explanation of those reasons that makes sense beyond the obvious ones. Seeking to excuse or explain away the fact that millions of people have used their democratic choices in what by all ordinary measures are illogical and inexplicable ways may simply be ignoring a plain truth that those people decided that giving vent to their racism and xenophobia was worth the economic/social risk. The headline on my piece on the relationship between Donald Trump and the “mainstream media” crystalised everything I had been trying to say. Trump v the media: did his tactics mortally wound the fourth estate? Read moreOvernight, the president-elect had released a two-minute video direct to camera on YouTube setting out his plans for his first 100 days. It was classic Trump – using the power of social media to bypass TV news and press outlets entirely and speak directly to the American people. What he’s doing is to cut out the role of the media as a filter that stands between a president and the public, and by doing so he is raising a serious threat to many of the values that media outlets hold dear: truth, fact and fairness to name but three.  Photograph: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images Is there no such thing as bad publicity for Trump?   imperium3 25 November 2016 2:15pmRegarding Trump, I think his entire philosophy is based on the old saw "There is no such thing as bad publicity." He does not mind upsetting people, in fact by this point he seems to be doing it deliberately. Because when everyone's talking about the latest thing he came out with, or the latest group he offended, they are still talking about Donald Trump. A view from Anna Leach, who works on the Guardian’s Global Development network. After the shocking (and some might say foolish) results of election this year in the US and UK, can developed nations continue to take a superior view over the political injustices of the world? Electing a self-evident misogynist as leader of the “free” world shows that sexism is alive and well all over. And although the contexts are different, we can find strength from working together.

We’ll be covering the global struggle on our women and girls series.  A few of you have been responding to our colleague Martn Belam’s thoughts below on Donald Trump’s “dead cat strategy”.   MrWaterproof 25 November 2016 1:44pmIs Trump's tweeting part of a dead cat strategy. Do you mean the one he wears on his head? Donald Trump’s Thanksgiving message: ‘Tensions just don’t heal overnight’   Robert Jenkins 25 November 2016 1:47pmI think that trumps mo is pretty clear now: make any process appear as chaotic as possible and leak names that are wildly inappropriate then when the picks are merely terrible people will think it's not as bad as it could of been.We saw it play out constantly in the campaign but most clearly in the debates where objectively trump performed awfully but the expectations were so low that it was considered a win for him to even turn up.Government on those terms will wear thin very quickly   vagues 25 November 2016 1:53pmI like the dead cat analogy. Perhaps that was why people voted for him... to hide something even more sinister. Before we move on to talk a bit more about some of the other stories that have got you talking this week, a couple more views on the Brexit questions raised by Anne Perkins (see 12:05).   bopo07 25 November 2016 1:32pmUntil people who voted remain at least try to acknowledge that some of the British population may have a valid reason for voting to leave the EU, we're never going to get back to more progressive politics. The people who may have voted Labour in the past, and therefore, the ones who offer the number of votes you need, feel that globalisation has not worked for them or their communities. Now, either try to understand this and move forward, and be ready for when the opportunity - inevitably - arises, or you can just carry on blaming Brexit for everything, calling people stupid rascists and never regain political power. "It's simple, stupid."   bitterengine 25 November 2016 1:21pmI think because the level of debate before the referendum was so poor and full of lies and emotion, that people have been left quite bitter. We didn't even come closer to the question "Would Britain be better off outside the EU?" We had a vote on it but our understanding is no better than a year a go. I feel like every day I am waking up, and finding myself working out how I am going to explain to people in our morning @GuardianNews round-up what Donald Trump was tweeting about last night.Guardian news (@guardiannews)2️⃣ We regret to inform you that the president-elect of the US has been tweeting again https://t.co/LsxUfLwojl pic.twitter.com/trdT6sdqWhNovember 22, 2016It seems completely unprecedented to have the president-elect of the US telling us that the cast of a play have been rude to his VP-to-be, or that the New York Times is failing, or that he’s thinking about appointing this person or that person to a role.It also gives us a question as journalists. Does he do it as part of a “dead cat strategy” - where you throw a dead cat on the table to distract from something else?

I think there's been a surge of this kind of reciprocal shouting because of the recent furore and hyperbole around the referendum campaign, which politicised a large group of people who previously had little interest in the system. In other words I blame Brexit.   PacoReidy 25 November 2016 12:10pm"Are we too quick to blame Brexit for everything?""We"?

It was reckless, it was political vanity, it was irresponsible and without a contingency plan they are negligent. And Labour are to blame for (still) not providing a credible opposition and alternative narrative. Brexit voters are to blame for being gullible and fantasists.   imperium3 25 November 2016 12:08pmAre we too quick to blame Brexit for everything?Yes. In fairness it's not a new trend - newspapers are always keen to blame long term economic trends on the most recent event.The same bad news stories which are currently all being blamed on Brexit, would have all been blamed on Conservative government policies before the referendum, and before 2010 they would have all been blamed on the global financial crisis. Simple narratives are seductive, but usually wrong. The autumn statement was astonishing. Nothing for the so-called Jams, the families who are just managing. And, maybe even more shocking, nothing at all for the NHS or, more specifically, for councils so they can afford to provide social care for older and vulnerable people – even though it is the biggest single cause of the NHS crisis.

Let’s be clear about second referendums. There are “good” ones and “bad” ones. A bad one is a desperate attempt by the government of the day and its allies to negate a first referendum it did not like. This was practised by Denmark (1993) and Ireland (2009). It worked, which is why the anti-Brexit lobby, now supported by Tony Blair, likes the idea. Such a referendum was at least better than France in 2005, where a vote against the Lisbon treaty was simply ignored by the established parties, with consequences that may yet prove dire.A good second referendum is quite different. It seeks approval for whatever deal is reached as a result of the first one. It seeks to take forward the first decision, not negate it.The fury in some quarters that greeted the UK vote on Brexit last June swiftly morphed into a demand that voters be immediately re-polled, as if they would then repent the error of their ways. It was the arrogance of the old politics on parade, laughably led by certain members of the House of Lords. It showed how thin is respect for democracy (mostly) on the left in Britain.Now comes a different question. The referendum said yes to the UK “leaving” the EU. David Cameron and Theresa May rightly accepted that decision, as they said they would. The divorce would proceed without hope of reconciliation.But divorce is a clumsy metaphor. Neighbouring countries do not marry and divorce. They become more or less separate, hence the shorthand of “soft” and “hard” Brexit. There is a world of difference between these two outcomes – so much so that pundits vie with each other in claiming the impossibility of both.The world must go on. At some point some sort of deal, however messy, will have to be done between Britain and the EU. There is no such thing as a wall in the Channel. Certainly the May government could fail in its negotiation. It could seek a general election mandate that could trump the Brexit referendum. But that is not a second referendum.Ideally, when tempers have cooled, a deal will be reached that removes the UK from the institutions of the EU but reformalises trade and population movement. The likelihood is that such a deal would anger the “hard” Brexiters more than the “soft” ones, but either way it would be controversial. As such, it would best be authenticated by a second referendum.This would not be an attempt to reverse the first referendum, merely to validate its outcome. It would be a “good” second referendum.TopicsBrexitFirst thoughtsEuropean UnionForeign policycommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
“The Simpsons is television,” the critic Matt Zoller Seitz observed, and he’s right. In many ways, it’s a more accurate portrait of the fluid, heterogeneous United States than any novel, film or play could hope to be. At more than 600 episodes and 28 seasons, the scope of the show has been huge and over two weeks, the cable network FXX will air every episode of the show back-to-back-to-back, ending on 7 December. We’ve picked the 25 best episodes of its lengthy run for your consideration.The concentration of incredible writing talent in the show’s golden years means that a lot of these are from the same few seasons in the 1990s, but they remain remarkably timely, quotable, and uncomfortably accurate in their portrayal of the huge swath of America that gets lost in the cracks in so much coastal culture.1. Homer the HereticSeason four, episode three, written by George Meyer      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   God visits Homer in a dream to tell him it’s cool with him if Homer stays home from church to watch football. Photograph: FoxHomer skips church, giving him the time to make his patented space-age moon waffles (ingredients: caramels, waffle batter, liquid smoke), win a call-in radio contest, and watch the Three Stooges, all while his family is freezing in church listening to Rev Lovejoy read a passage from “The Lamentations of Jeremiah, long version”.Homer’s brief atheism ends after a brush with death and a rescue led by Ned Flanders, among others. It’s one of the few full scripts by George Meyer, lead rewrite guy for the show’s classic years, and it’s arguably his best: funny, adroit, with a core of surprising seriousness about religion. And a cameo by God himself, who, by the way, has five fingers to the rest of Simpsonworld’s four.2. Marge vs the Monorail Season four, episode 12, written by Conan O’Brien      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Lyle Lanley and Lisa. Photograph: FoxAs with everything Simpsonian, Marge vs the Monorail is a heartfelt character study – this time of Marge, whose stick-in-the-mudness saves the town from a huckster, Lyle Lanley (played, as were all the show’s hucksters during its glory days, by Phil Hartman), who sells the town a bunch of empty promises about new jobs and great infrastructure projects and delivers a dangerously unstable monorail system. Lanley is one of the show’s great one-off characters, a charmer who knows how to pander to Lisa’s vanity, Homer’s laziness and, unsuccessfully, Marge’s community spirit.The script by Conan O’Brien is filled with great gags, notably Homer’s early-episode noodling to the tune of the theme from The Flintstones: “Simpson – Homer Simpson! He’s the greatest guy in his-to-ry. From the town of Springfield, he’s about to hit a chestnut tree. Aaaah!”3. Much Apu About NothingSeason seven, episode 23, written by David S Cohen      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘Who needs the infinite compassion of Ganesha when I’ve got Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman staring at me from Entertainment Weekly with their dead eyes?’ Photograph: FoxHank Azaria’s portrayal of Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has drawn criticism as the series has outlived the conventions that gave birth to it, but if the accusations of lazy racial humor ever go to trial, Exhibit A for the defense will be Much Apu About Nothing. The episode is a heartfelt ode to the American immigrant that’s peerless. After a bear menaces – well, wanders around – Evergreen Terrace, corrupt Mayor Quimby raises taxes to pay for an unnecessary bear patrol, and then decides to blame immigrants for the tax hike and holds a referendum on whether they ought to be deported. The referendum passes and Apu, who is in the country illegally, has to scramble for his citizenship. Homer, having repented of his vote to deport his buddy, gives him disastrously bad advice on how to pass his citizenship test.Taken one way, it’s a harsh poke at people who reflexively blame their woes on immigrants and refuse to learn their own history. Taken another, it’s pure Americana. Or both.4. Homer’s EnemySeason eight, episode 23, written by John Swartzwelder      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   I can’t stress enough how much Frank Grimes likes to be called ‘Grimey’. Photograph: FoxHomer’s surprisingly various life is the subject of more than a few throwaway gags throughout the series – at one point Marge lists all his various careers; at another, all the times he’s been arrested – but one character is utterly vexed by his good fortune – namely, Frank Grimes, or “Grimey”, as he likes to be called.Grimes, played by Hank Azaria, has had to fight for everything he’s ever had. Homer’s ability to coast through life, therefore, seems like a personal insult. Things just get better from there, for Homer, at least.The episode is written by John Swartzwelder, one of the show’s longest-running writers and such a recluse that one theory holds that he doesn’t exist at all. A fellow Simpsons writer, Dan Greaney, disagreed in a 2001 New York Times feature on the show by the critic AO Scott: “Write this down,” Greaney demanded: “John Swartzwelder is the best writer in the world today in any medium.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Principal Skinner: This dessert is exquisite. What do you call it?Mrs Krabappel: Applesauce. Photograph: Fox5. Grade School ConfidentialSeason 8, episode 19, written by Rachel PulidoWhen exactly the writers give themselves permission to more or less totally abandon the family of the title is a matter for much scholarly debate, but arguably the two richest non-Simpsons characters during the series’ most fertile period are Edna Krabappel and Seymour Skinner.The hard-bitten teacher and the naive principal are a perfect match for each other, comically and romantically, and as their relationship blossoms before a horrified Bart, the show finds odd pathos among two embittered public servants who suddenly realize amid their self-pity that they actually have each other.6. You Only Move TwiceSeason 8, episode 2, written by John SwartzwelderHomer gets a new job in a town far away from the madness of Springfield, working for an innovative company in a planned community where Lisa is stimulated, Bart is included at school, and Marge is pampered. It turns out none of the family wants any of those things, or at least not enough to want to lose the ability to complain about not having them. It’s a lovely journey of self-discovery, punctuated by hints – then clear warnings – then explicit demonstrations of something Homer probably should have picked up on: Homer’s new boss, Hank Scorpio (an excellent Albert Brooks), is a mad scientist bent on world domination.7. Lisa the VegetarianSeason 7, episode 5, written by David S CohenLisa is devastated when she visits the petting zoo and realizes that the food on her plate and the animal in the zoo are one and the same. Homer couldn’t care less about where his meals come from but he loves his daughter, even when she goes much too far and ruins his barbecue. It sounds serious, but it also has some of the show’s best gags, notably a Meat Council propaganda film the students watch to dispel wild rumors vegetarians might be spreading.8. In Marge We TrustSeason 8, episode 22, written by Donick CaryAs the series goes on, The Simpsons develops something its writers call “plot drift”, in which its various plots and subplots become increasingly disconnected from each other and themselves. There may be no purer expression of plot drift than In Marge We Trust, in which Marge accidentally usurps the blasé Rev Lovejoy’s pastoral role in the Springfield church community, and Homer seeks the answer to one of life’s great mysteries: why is his head pictured on a box of Japanese soap?9. Lisa the IconoclastSeason 7, episode 16, written by Jonathan CollierLisa discovers that the town’s founder, Jebediah Springfield, was in fact a bloodthirsty pirate named Hans Sprungfeld, and she sets about showing the townspeople the error of their ways. There are a lot of good Homer-and-Lisa episodes in the Simpsons canon, but this one is particularly cromulent: the father-daughter team, so often at odds, finds itself united against the world, Homer because he loves his daughter and there’s lots of stuff he doesn’t understand, Lisa because she loves her dad and thinks she’s knows better than everyone.What's the greatest TV show of all time? Easy. The Simpsons Read more10. Bart Gets an FSeason 2, episode 1, written by David M SternThere’s a lot of unexpectedly gut-wrenching stuff with Bart in The Simpsons, and in this, the earliest episode on the list, perhaps the saddest moment is his breakdown in front of his teacher Mrs Krabappel. “I tried this time! I really tried!” he sobs, having failed her class by a single point. “This is as good as I could do but I still failed!” The episode has a great turn from Marcia Wallace as Edna Krabappel, too, as the embittered but not-quite-heartless teacher most of us had somewhere along the way.11. A Milhouse DividedSeason 8, episode 6, written by Steve TompkinsOne of the funniest half-hours of The Simpsons is also one of the bleakest: Kirk and Luann Van Houten, Milhouse’s parents, call it quits after years of marriage. The consequences are predictable: Kirk loses his job at the cracker factory, Luann starts dating an American Gladiator, and Milhouse begins to lash out. Unusually for the time, the show doesn’t end with the Van Houtens getting back together – Kirk does his best to win his wife back, but she’s sick of him. Instead, it’s the Simpsons themselves, shaken by the dissolution of a marriage so close to them, who find closure.12. Homer the GreatSeason 6, episode 12, written by John SwartzwelderIt turns out Lenny and Carl are in a secret club very much like the Freemasons, from which they get special perks. Homer wants in, of course – and when he joins, he discovers that the club, called the Stonecutters, are basically the Illuminati, with a catchy theme song into the bargain: “Who controls the British Crown? Who keeps the metric system down? We do! We do!”13. I Love LisaSeason 4, episode 15, written by Al Jean and Mike ReissLisa discovers something we all discover sooner or later: sometimes someone loves you and you don’t love them back. In this case it’s the dim but wonderful Ralph Wiggum, to whom no one but Lisa is kind enough to give a card on Valentine’s Day. Lisa eventually has to shut Ralph down, and the moment is captured on video: “Watch this, Lise,” Bart says while watching the replay. “You can actually pinpoint the second when his heart rips in half.”14. Deep Space HomerSeason 5, episode 15, written by David MirkinNasa discovers a problem: its astronauts aren’t relatable enough. Homer picks the right moment to call the administration to complain about its “boring space launches”, and he’s been feeling down anyway – he was due to win Employee of the Month, which his union contract guarantees him at least once “regardless of incompetence, gross obesity or rank odor”, but the plant gave the prize away to an inanimate carbon rod. Homer makes it into space, where he nearly wrecks everything, but don’t worry – the rod saves the day.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest 15. El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro HomerSeason 8, episode 9, written by Ken KeelerHomer’s quest to be the toughest guy at the chilli-eating contest leads him to consume Guatemalan insanity peppers. The peppers send him on a vision quest to learn who his soul mate is. Is it Marge, or someone else? The psychedelic sequence, with surprisingly non-invasive guest star Johnny Cash as Homer’s familiar, gives the show some of its most beautiful animation to date. And the reconciliation between Homer and Marge at the end is genuinely moving.16. Flaming Moe’sSeason 3, episode 10, written by Robert CohenHomer gives Moe a drink recipe that makes Moe’s bar the hottest spot in town … and Moe takes all the credit. There are amazing moments throughout this one, notably the Cheers-esque title sequence mid-episode, but the standout has to be Bart calling Moe’s and asking Moe to ask around for a Hugh Jass … who answers the phone. Hugh: Hello, this is Hugh Jass. Bart: Uh, hi. Hugh: Who’s this? Bart: Bart Simpson. Hugh: What can I do for you, Bart? Bart: Uh, look. I’ll level with you, mister. This is a crank call that sorta backfired, and I’d like to bail out right now. Hugh: All right, better luck next time. (He hangs up) What a nice young man.17. Sideshow Bob RobertsSeason 6, episode 5, written by Bill Oakley and Josh WeinsteinSideshow Bob calls Birch Barlow, a character legally distinct from Rush Limbaugh, to complain about his treatment in prison and ends up running for mayor against six-term winner “Diamond Joe” Quimby, a notoriously corrupt politician pilloried by Barlow as “an illiterate, tax-cheating, wife-swapping, pot-smoking spendocrat”. Americans, as anyone who’s been watching the news knows, remain terminally curious about the devil they don’t know.18. Mr PlowSeason 4, episode 9, written by Jon VittiHomer and Barney start competing snowplow services, Homer after he’s tricked into buying a plow with the insurance money he collected after totaling his car, Barney after asking Homer how he became a success. Barney’s service trumps Homer’s, not least because Linda Ronstadt agrees to star in an ad for the service. (“We’ve been looking for a project to do together for a while,” Barney explains.) Homer and Barney eventually reconcile, proclaiming that not even God can stop them now. 19. Mother SimpsonSeason 7, episode 8, written by Richard AppelHomer’s mom Mona (Glenn Close), whom his dad always told him had died, mysteriously shows up again, and under circumstances that cause Bart and Lisa to suspect that she might be a con artist. The truth is more complicated, as is Mona’s relationship with Grampa Abe Simpson. The family has to unite to save Mona from the same forces that have kept her away for so long; it’s a funny episode, but it may have the saddest ending of any single show in the series.20. Bart the FinkSeason 7, episode 15, teleplay by John Swartzwelder and story by Bob KushellBart writes a check to his hero, Krusty the Clown, in the hopes of getting the signature off the back, only to discover Krusty has signed with a stamp for his Cayman Islands holding corporation. Upset, he goes to the bank to complain … and sees Krusty hunted down for tax fraud, whereupon the embattled entertainer fakes his own death.The episode’s combination of bizarre hijinks, celebrity parody and scattershot humor is perfectly Simpsonian, from the Lionel Barrymore-style banker who “can’t discuss that client’s secret, illegal accounts” to Handsome Pete, the bizarre little man who dances for nickels at Sea Captain Horatio McCallister’s shanty.21. Homer vs the 18th AmendmentSeason 8, episode 18, written by John SwartzwelderAh, Prohibition. When Springfield outlaws alcohol after the spectacle of a drunken Bart shocks the populace at a St Patrick’s Day parade, Homer decides to take matters into his own hands and start a distillery and a distribution network. It is, even Marge admits, the most inventive Homer has ever been, and his operation outside the law gives him the jump on the actual Duff brewery, who decide to try non-alcoholic beer. 22. Treehouse of Horror VIISeason 8, episode 1, written by Ken Keeler, Dan Greaney and David S CohenIt’s hard to pick one Treehouse of Horror, but this year, one stands out: season 8’s electoral extravaganza, or as TV news anchor Kent Brockman calls it, “Campaign ’96: America Flips a Coin.” The episode is probably best remembered for its memetic best line – “Don’t blame me, I voted for Kodos,” a riff on the “voted for Bush” bumper stickers that a bitter half of America plastered to their cars. But there’s other good stuff here, too, like Bart’s less-evil-than-advertised twin, and Lisa’s accidental creation of a tiny world, which she visits in shrunken form.23. 22 Short Films About SpringfieldSeason 7, episode 21, written by Appel, David S Cohen, Collier, Jennifer Crittenden, Greg Daniels, Brent Forrester, Greaney, Rachel Pulido, Steve Tompkins, Weinstein, Oakley, and GroeningIt’s another episode that starts off as a parody and goes somewhere wholly original: mimicking the checkerboard structure of mid-1990s arthouse hits like Pulp Fiction, Short Cuts and of course 32 Short Films About Glenn Gould. The episode features 22 one-minute stories by 11 writers, notably a Spanish-language-only look into Bumblebee Man’s home life, and an exchange between Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers about whether or not Skinner’s house is on fire. (It is.)24. Trash of the TitansSeason 9, episode 22, written by Ian Maxtone-GrahamSteve Martin guest-stars as Ray Patterson, the sanitation commissioner Homer decides to oust using good old-fashioned dirty tricks politicking and insults. Homer’s reasons for doing literally everything in this episode are terrible – he insults the town’s garbage collectors for no reason, runs against Patterson entirely because he doesn’t want to apologize, and when he wins, doubles down on all his crazy promises so he won’t have to back off on them, either. 25. Clown in the DumpsSeason 26, episode 1, written by Joel H CohenA touching 2014 episode with the show’s trademark wry take on a serious subject, in this case, the death of an elderly parent. Like most men, Krusty worries he’s disappointed his father; like most people, he takes a while to comes to terms with it and with ageing. It’s also worth including for the unbelievably beautiful two-minute long “couch gag” intro sequence by legendary arthouse animator Don Hertzfeldt, who shares with us visions of The Sampsans in its [you know what, you do the math] season in the year 10,535.

Into the debate about how technology affects our human existance comes exciting news from Hollywood: Sony announces a new romantic comedy promising to examine “the illusion of choice – and just how hard it is to find the right person in a sea of options”. Its title? Love in the Time of Dick Pics.But then this is no surprise, for few industries – quilting, perhaps; crofting at a push – are as fundamentally tech-sceptic as film. For all the hoo-ha about special effects, when it comes to the digital revolution, the movies refuse to televise. Rather, they lobby endlessly against it. Even the most contemporary romcoms insist meeting cute always beats swiping right. It was inevitable the dating-site enthusiast in How to be Single would fall for the owner of the bar she frequents for its free Wi-Fi. I’d put money on the heroine of Dick Pics finding Mr Right round the corner, rather than amid the genital jpegs.Sci-fi films supply apocalyptic visions of a flatscreen future, which usually conclude with a forced yet ultimately happier return to a luddite age. Cerebral dramas such as Ex Machina, Her and Demonlover caution that emotional investment in artificial intelligence is a slipway to suicide.La La Land review: Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone shine in a sun-drenched musical masterpiece Read moreWhy such hostility? Well, the internet is nicking cinema’s business – both by enabling people to watch films at home and by dangling an attractive alternative pastime. Worse still, it kills stories. Screenwriters must concoct loopholes so plots still hold water. For years, all that was required was a quick mention of how reception can be a bit patchy in this part of the woods; shame, what with that axe murderer. Now everything must be set pre-smartphones. Otherwise, all imposter plots are kaput, for a start. Wondering if that Guerre fella is totally kosher? Verification only takes a second with 4G.It’s also, of course, that laptop-tapping is inherently uncinematic, compared to a car chase or beach clinch. No filmic language to cope with that fact has yet been developed, or ever may be. A few films do still have a pop at co-opting software into their narratives. In Lion, out early next year, Dev Patel tracks down his long-lost family in India with the help of Google Maps. But most have put themselves in reverse gear and slammed down the pedal. Nostalgia is their watchword, both in setting and aesthetic. La La Land – the musical that will win the Oscar for best picture next spring – isn’t just a hymn to golden-age Hollywood, it looks like a Fred and Ginger film, had Astaire had stubble and Rogers driven a Prius. The best compliment Mel Gibson has said he’s received about upcoming war epic Hacksaw Ridge is: “‘Wow, it’s like the way they used to make films.’ I said, ‘You mean like back in the 40s?’ And they said, ‘No, like back in the 80s’ – like it’s ancient history!”Film-makers brag about the credibility afforded by aping the ancient. Out this week is Allied, the spy thriller its star Brad Pitt calls “a throwback to the old 40s films, when you’d see people in cars and you’d see the rear screen, and you know they’re just sitting on a set”. Ben Affleck has said similar about his new gangster throwback, Live by Night, ditto Warren Beatty with his screwball Howard Hughes biopic Rules Don’t Apply.The question is: will this work with audiences? Surely, anyone outside Hollywood’s battened-down hatches will find such fogeyism off-putting? I suspect not. For evidence mounts that we are all reacting against the effects of tech – even as our addiction to the technologies themselves persists. Weaning ourselves offline is all but impossible. And we cannot simply maintain hostility, as Hollywood does. But we do seek to humanise tech, in form and function.This week, two new apps were unveiled. One is an extension to Google Maps which feeds in live data to tell you how busy shops and cafes are. The other, the Catholic App, is an interactive church locator designed for those who need to confess, fast. Already dubbed “Sindr”, this official product aims to boost mass numbers and confession stats by offering “a companion that guides you through the digital noise and leads you to a sacred place”.Sex and shopping have long been well served by the internet; now spiritual fulfilment and solitude are getting in on the act. Yet both are antidotes more than additions, attempts to slam the brakes on what can seem like an relentless gallop into a terrifying future.In one of the most famous scenes in Gabriel García Márquez’s Love in the Time of Cholera, a post-coital chap impulsively “open[s] a can of red paint that was within reach of the bunk, wet[s] his index finger” and scrawls the words “This pussy is mine” on his lover’s tum, with helpful arrow. Whether Dick Pics can hit such romantic heights remains to be seen. But I bet it’ll try. Seeing someone get their hands dirty will always trump watching them twiddle their thumbs.TopicsMoviesOpinionShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content

Nasa’s network of satellites provide a wealth of information on climate change, with the Earth science division’s budget set to grow to $2bn next year. By comparison, space exploration has been scaled back somewhat, with a proposed budget of $2.8bn in 2017.Bob Walker, a senior Trump campaign adviser, said there was no need for Nasa to do what he has previously described as “politically correct environmental monitoring”.“We see Nasa in an exploration role, in deep space research,” Walker told the Guardian. “Earth-centric science is better placed at other agencies where it is their prime mission.“My guess is that it would be difficult to stop all ongoing Nasa programs but future programs should definitely be placed with other agencies. I believe that climate research is necessary but it has been heavily politicized, which has undermined a lot of the work that researchers have been doing. Mr Trump’s decisions will be based upon solid science, not politicized science.”Read the full piece:Trump to scrap Nasa climate research in crackdown on ‘politicized science’ Read more Former Florida governor, education policy wonk and ex-presidential candidate Jeb Bush praises the DeVose pick, hailing her “allegiance to families”:Jeb Bush (@JebBush)Betsy DeVos is an outstanding pick for Secretary of Education.

Stein launched an online fundraising page seeking donations toward a $2m fund she said was needed to request reviews of the results in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Stein said she was acting due to “compelling evidence of voting anomalies” and that data analysis had indicated “significant discrepancies in vote totals”. Her move came amid calls for recounts or audits of the election results by groups of academics and activists concerned that foreign hackers may have interfered with election systems. Donald Trump won unexpected and narrow victories against Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and may yet win Michigan, where a result has not yet been declared. Donald Trump has released a statement describing grand plans for American education under the leadership of Betsy DeVos, his education secretary nominee. DeVos is a Michigan philanthropist who has chaired the state Republican party who “has kept a low national profile,” according to Chalkbeat: “She has neither worked in public education nor chosen public schools for her own children, who attended private Christian schools.”DeVos’ husband, Dick, is an heir to the Amway fortune and a former company president, AP reports. Trump called DeVos “a brilliant and passionate education advocate.”“Under her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families,” Trump said in a statement. “I am pleased to nominate Betsy as Secretary of the Department of Education.” Donald Trump has chosen charter school advocate Betsy DeVos to be his education secretary, the AP reports.The nomination is subject to senate confirmation.The education policy web site Chalkbeat had said that a DeVos appointment could indicate that Trump intends to go through with a sweeping school vouchers plan and would leave the future of Common Core education standards an open question.

“Britain’s panto dwarves are grumpy at being frozen out by average height actors” reported the Telegraph on Monday. At this time of year, newspapers like to trumpet a “dwarf shortage”, or something to similar effect. This year, it has been reported that a pantomime company is choosing to employ taller actors in a production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs as they charge lower rates than actors with dwarfism.People with dwarfism deserve respect – not ridicule | Kiruna Stamell Read moreI am an actor and I have dwarfism, but I’m not grumpy. I’ve actually never played one of the seven dwarves – I’ve always wanted to be more progressive in my approach to acting roles, smashing societal expectations rather than conforming to them. But that’s my personal choice, and I judge no actor for doing Snow White.There are an estimated 6,000 people with dwarfism in the UK. Despite how it can appear in the media, most are not entertainers or actors. They have “normal” jobs and the same hopes and aspirations as the rest of the population. Consequently, finding a person with dwarfism who is a professional actor with the experience and the talent you’re looking for is not easy. Rarity and lack of availability should make it no surprise that actors with dwarfism, in a production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, can command a higher rate. And let’s not forget they are a significant part of the marketing of the production.That’s not to say that I don’t have issues with Snow White. Not with the play itself – when the characters are well-written and played by talented actors who are allowed to shine, it’s wonderful. But it has somehow become many people’s only experience of someone with dwarfism; so much so that many believe this play is the only thing dwarves do. When I tell people I am an actor it’s often their automatic assumption. Many non-actors with dwarfism also experience this assumption from strangers.I will do panto, but I choose to play roles not traditionally played by a person with dwarfism. My first panto role was as Tinker Bell in Peter Pan and this year I’m Willowsnap (good fairy) in Hackney Empire’s Sleeping Beauty. Is my height exploited by these roles or does it enrich them? Every actor brings their body to a role. I can’t leave being a dwarf behind me; whatever I do, I will be a person with dwarfism doing it. But when characters are well written, dynamic and interesting, that’s what excites me as an actor.Disabled actors need to be allowed to play characters – with their disabilities present – but in productions where their disabilities are not the sole focus. I have bigger dreams for actors from diverse communities. Look at the awesome Lisa Hammond playing Donna Yates in EastEnders. Hammond, Liz Carr and RJ Mitte are among a slow trickle of actors with disabilities appearing on stage and screen.We’ve had all the insults. Now we’re reclaiming the language of disability | Penny Pepper Read moreNot hiring people with dwarfism to play the seven dwarves in this case seems to be a financial choice on behalf of the Qdos entertainment group. We shouldn’t be indirectly mocked by an average-height actor “pretending” on their knees. And nothing offends me more than an adult actor with dwarfism being replaced by a child. “Nothing about us without us” has long been the call to action of minority groups. We want to be included. Excluding us leads to mistakes in how we are represented and discriminates against us by shutting us out.This removal of disabled people and difference from public view, employing non-disabled people to “replicate” our disabilities, happens all the time. Take the Snow White and the Huntsman movies, which used computer graphics to replicate achondroplasia, a specific condition most commonly recognised as giving those who have it a “dwarfish” look. Other disabilities are also experiencing this; look at Eddie Redmayne cast to portray Stephen Hawking in the recent biopic.So, should Snow White’s dwarves be played by actors with dwarfism? Definitely. But dwarves should also be playing other roles, such as the prince, princess and dame. And people with dwarfism, including actors, are about more than just panto. Disabled people should be everywhere, on our stages and screens, and not solely defined by our bodies.TopicsDisabilityOpinionPanto seasonTheatrecommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
After the US election, many people feel we’re on the verge of an apocalypse. What might not be obvious is that it’s an artificial intelligence apocalypse, like the ones in The Terminator and The Matrix. The fact is the machines have taken over, enslaved us, and may now destroy us.No, seriously. Let me explain.Here’s what an AI apocalypse looks like in broad brushstrokes:1. We carefully program AI with a well-defined goal for the betterment of the human race, give it power, and set it loose.2. It develops unexpected emergent behaviours, and begins to have impacts unforeseen by its creators.3. The well-defined goal is achieved. Unfortunately, the unintended consequence is the downfall of humanity.Let’s compare this to current circumstances.The Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard reports that nearly half of all Americans get their news from Facebook. The social media site delivers news via its algorithms, which decide what stories you, as an individual user, see, and in what order. You might ask what’s wrong with that, when Facebook’s mission statement is to “give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected”.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘We’re on the verge of an AI apocalypse, like the one in The Matrix.’ Photograph: Cine Text/Sportsphoto Ltd /AllstarBut the fact is that rather than serving this goal, Facebook’s AIs are servicing a far older and more well-established social goal, which was designed for the betterment of mankind. This is the goal of maximising value in pursuit of economic self-interest.Neoliberal economics is based on the idea that the pursuit of individual, economic self-interest leads to the creation of greater value, which benefits society and results in the emergent betterment of mankind.The individual self-interest being pursued in this case is that of Facebook, a legal person who is programmed, within our economic and legal system, with a single mandated goal: the delivery of maximum value to its shareholders. Facebook’s AIs are the technological limbs of that person, and they must ultimately reach out into the world to carry out that goal.To that end, an election cycle is a goldrush, where these value-maximising AIs can reach out to mine your eyeballs. The more you check your feed, the more ad-based value the AIs can generate for the shareholders.What no one foresaw was that in order to keep us clicking and sharing, headlines had to work harder to grab our attention, shouting ever more sensational and titillating news stories, millisecond-by-millisecond. The resulting lightspeed feedback loop coupled our fears and hopes for the future to the simple, relentless value system of the AIs and their corporation. It was only a matter of time before humans became collaborators, or as Arron Banks, friend of Nigel Farage and financier of the Leave.eu campaign, stated in the recently published account of its Brexit campaign: “The more outrageous we are, the more attention we’ll get. The more attention we get, the more outrageous we’ll be.”If the outrageous headlines can get you to take action, and click through, then there are even more AIs out there ready to feed their own revenue loops, with highly shareable, click-baiting stories and memes. They even exploit simple human foibles, with finger slips that activate ad links, and malware that infects our devices to keep other AIs informed about us, so we can be further targeted with material tuned to our particular trigger points. Each step in this massive computational network manipulates you for a click-through, generating a micropayment-driven AI ad placement feeding frenzy.Of course, it’s not just Facebook involved as an end supplier in this new economic boom. Note that beneath each CNN article, every one of them sold with a tempting headline, there usually appears copious paid content. This is part of an algorithmically driven revenue generation strategy called “smart ad placement” by Turner Broadcasting, the subsidiary of Time-Warner that owns CNN. Turner’s site boasts of how optimising algorithms place ads “in the style of CNN editorial content, with the ability to be placed directly in editorial streams of content and alongside relevant CNN editorial videos and articles”. Even a “pure information” site like Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight has been accused of warping its statistical algorithms to make the US election seem closer than it might have done, and its graphs therefore more tempting for obsessive checking. Silver has defended himself against these accusations, tweeting: “The reason we adjust polls for the national trend is because **that’s what works best emperically** [sic]. It’s not a subjective assumption.” But there is no doubt that his site is now a for-profit poll predictor, owned by ESPN.Some are concerned that the problem that has developed is so-called “fake news”. While Wikipedia defines “fake news” as a synonym for news satire, in the post-election shock it has now become an umbrella term for the uncontrolled explosion of misleading information dispersed on social media during the election. Mark Zuckerberg has pledged to make Facebook impede “fake” news. Perhaps he’ll use real human editors, but in the recent past, his company has eliminated real people in this role, in favour of algorithms, to ensure less bias in their presentation of news.A moment of truth for Mark Zuckerberg | John Naughton Read moreBeing able to discern what is true and what is fake is not a goal that AIs can achieve easily. As Zuckerberg himself has said, the problem is “complex, both technically and philosophically”. This is because the “truth” is a complex human concept that is very hard to programme. Witness that the website Politifact, dedicated to fact-checking US politics, has to place “truth” into six categories (only half of which are definitive) and provide a detailed, carefully written analysis to explain the nuances of the verity of each statement it examines. Human truths and falsehoods are not simple 0s or 1s.Furthermore, the war on fake news misses the point. Regardless of whether AIs present “true” or “false” news, they will still be working towards their primary directive: the maximisation of value for the corporation.The unforeseen outcomes of neoliberal values coupled to highly efficient AIs are ultimately emergent effects on our social fabric. AIs “personalise” newsfeeds for you, but this personalisation isn’t really for your benefit, it’s to place you in a tighter demographic category, making you a more targeted value proposition to sell to advertisers. The effect of this is that we have all been herded into digital echo chambers. And, with our emotions engaged by clickbaiting, profit-generating, dubious headlines, we’ve aided the process through enraged blocking and unfriending of anyone whose opinions differ from our own.The truth is that Americans are no more simply Republican and Democrat than news is simply true and false, and our segregation into crisp, sale-able demographic packages serves only to reduce a complex human picture made up of difficult social and political issues. But the vast, unsympathetic network of AIs is not concerned with this complexity, it is working towards its programmed goal: to maximise value. And it is doing a great job. Through the election cycle Facebook’s stock rose 924% faster than the US stock market index, the S&P 500.The unintended consequence of this massive AI success may now be our own downfall: an apocalypse, heralded not by trumpets, but by Trump/Pence. Leaders who are more than willing to collaborate with our new robot overlords, communicating with us through them via a series of ever more inflammatory tweets. A world where we are more closed as individuals, and where we are less connected as communities, the ironic opposite of the world envisioned in Facebook’s mission statement.I’d write more, but right now I’ve got to go and check my Facebook feed, CNN, and any other news site I can find to see what outrageous things our president-elect may have done in the past few minutes. Or perhaps find something to share that might help impede his progress. Perhaps a funny Joe Biden meme.Somewhere an AI would smile. If it had a face.TopicsFacebookOpinionArtificial intelligence (AI)ConsciousnessComputingSocial networkingcommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
“For the major media, almost all the campaign reporting focused on the candidates and polls. Almost nobody bothered to talk to the voters. The Chicago Tribune, the midwest’s biggest newspaper, doesn’t even have a midwestern beat any more and seldom sends reporters outside the Chicago metro area. Yet this was where the election was decided.” Reading your article (The rust belt strikes back, 21 November), I was reminded of the great days when the Guardian and other major papers had northern desks and northern editors.I’m a lifelong Guardian reader and paid-up supporter who was born in Manchester and has lived in the north all my 72 years. In my day job as a standup comedian and folkie I saw what was happening to the great industrial cities and smaller towns here, from the once-busy ports of Hull and Goole to the coal towns of the Dearne Valley; from rust belt cities like Sheffield and Middlesbrough to the cotton towns of Lancashire.Nothing of that managed decay and decline was understood inside the London bubble. A kind of cognitive dissonance settled on the media. A few documentaries and the occasional opinion piece appeared over the years but there were no howls of protest, no shock at the millions north of the Severn/Wash line dumped by laissez faire unfettered capitalism. The referendum was won by snake oil millionaire salesmen who convinced the benighted of the post industrial wastelands that the problem was Europe not London. The media didn’t see this coming because, fixated on polls and personalities and with no real presence north of Watford they hadn’t a clue what was happening in the wastelands  (John Harris and Owen Jones excepted).The (ex-Manchester) Guardian and other major media voices need to build a northern (and a Welsh, a Scots and a Midlands) presence. They need feet on the street and ears in the pubs and clubs and they need writers who understand the lives of the people that they are among. Otherwise we will end up in a JG Ballard world where shadowy figures stumble round a decayed hinterland while, snug in their rural fortresses and southern citadels, the higher orders sleep safe. And as for that much trumpeted “northern powerhouse” – don’t get me started – ask the man or woman on the Bury tram what he or she thinks about it and the answer will be a colloquial term for testicles.Mike HardingManchester• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/lettersTopicsMediaNational newspapersNewspapers & magazinesThe GuardianEuropean UnionForeign policylettersShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Senator Derryn Hinch has said the government has a “good chance” of passing the Australian Building and Construction Commission bill and promised to vote for it if amendments were made.At a joint press conference with Nick Xenophon to trumpet their whistleblower amendments to one industrial relations bill, Hinch signalled that a separate agreement would pass the ABCC bill if the government protected subcontractors’ pay and changed how the the building code is applied.Senate passes union regulator bill after Coalition whistleblower concession Read moreOn Tuesday Hinch and the Nick Xenophon Team are presenting the government and opposition with proposed amendments to the ABCC bill, some jointly agreed between them. Xenophon said a deal was not likely this week.At 2am the registered organisations commission bill passed the Senate with One Nation, NXT and Hinch’s support after the government agreed to amendments to protect union whistleblowers.Debate about the ABCC bill later resumed, with Hinch promising to vote in favour of it if amendments were made to security of payments legislation, such as forcing head contractors to hold money on trust.He called for amendments to include incentives to take on apprentices, and that the building code not apply retrospectively – or at least only to apply to workplace deals struck in the past six months.The code attached to the ABCC bill would apply to enterprise agreements struck after 24 April 2014, which gives it retrospective effect because it bars builders from government work based on deals struck before the code was in place.“If the bill is not properly amended then I’m not afraid at all to vote it down,” Hinch said, labelling his approach “pro-worker and anti-corruption”.Asked if the government should be confident the ABCC bill would pass, Hinch told the press conference: “If they treat it like they did yesterday they have a good chance of getting it through.“If they treat it as waffle, they won’t. As it stands and after the way we were treated over this issue, it is looking pretty good.”Xenophon said his party’s positions on the two industrial relations bills were separate and negotiations on the ABCC would continue.He said NXT wanted security of payments legislation to prevent subcontractors missing out when principal contractors went broke or delayed payments, and for the building code attached to the bill to ensure that “Australian standard [construction] material is used in our buildings”.“I can’t imagine we will come to a final position on that this week,” he said.Senator David Leyonhjelm told Guardian Australia he was still in talks with the government over his vote on the ABCC.Leyonhjelm had asked for reform to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act in return for his vote but now says “realistically the government can’t deliver that” as Labor, the Greens and some in the Coalition oppose it.He said the government had come up with “a couple” of reforms to improve freedom to help sway his vote but refused to name them, quipping: “If I told you what they were I would have to kill you immediately after.”The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, told a press conference on Tuesday she would not comment on ongoing negotiations with the crossbench except to say she was “very impressed” with the way they had approached the industrial relations bills.To avoid the American nightmare, Australia needs solidarity | Van Badham Read moreIn Senate question time, Cash said Australia could not afford “the lawlessness we continue to see in the building and construction sector”. She cited numerous industrial breaches by the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union and fines issued by the federal court.“It is our third-largest industry in Australia and we must do everything we can to ensure it continues to prosper and grow.”Malcolm Turnbull praised Cash for passage of the registered organisations commission bill. The bill would benefit the economy because it “reduced the potential for corruption and abuse, and malfeasance”, the prime minister said.“What you’ve seen here is legislation passed that will make it much harder for union officials to abuse the rights of their members [while] misusing their money.”TopicsIndustrial relationsDerryn HinchAustralian politicsNick XenophonNick Xenophon TeamDavid LeyonhjelmnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
For Chelsea fans, or indeed anyone with an interest in the high-rev methods of Antonio Conte, there was a slightly alarming moment as the Premier League international break arrived at the start of October. Conte announced he would be going to Italy to rest. He was already exhausted. OK, then. Just the 31 league games, two domestic cups, one transfer window and 10-15 miles of febrile touchline sprints left to go this season. What could possibly go wrong from here?It is understandable Conte should have arrived in west London less than refreshed given his summer at Euro 2016, the burdens of starting a major job and his own full-body absorption in the process: the hair-tearing grief at every setback, the tendency to celebrate each high with uncontained, eye-popping joy, haring about like a man who has just struck oil beneath his patio decking or made the first ever recorded discovery of chocolate ice cream.In reality Conte is simply a manager who works best coiled tight and always on the edge. In this respect he looks a pretty good fit for a Premier League season where top spot has changed hands nine times and where the ability to cajole a cohesive whole out of a new-ish group of players while simultaneously sliding down the banisters and performing complex calculus on an abacus is likely to decide the destiny of an open title race.With just under a third of the season gone four points separate the top five teams, all of whom have a reasonable chance of going on to win it. Beyond this the league is unusually interesting in a tactical sense, with a shared attempt at the top to marry technical players and positional fluidity with a full-throttle physicality that feels quite English in its unquestioning intensity.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Antonio Conte pleased as Chelsea make it six wins in a rowAs Conte nipped off for a lie-down at the start of October there was a view in these pages that any team finishing ahead of Liverpool at the end of the season would do so “bloodied and blistered and breathless”. Six weeks on the latest club to take up the slack at the front of the peloton are Chelsea, to whom the same reasoning might now be applied. Chelsea’s current run of six league wins without conceding a goal has its roots in Conte’s bold shift of shape in September. The early attempts at a 4-2-4 had already begun to elide into a 4-3-3. Defeat by Arsenal brought some soul-searching and a more profound change to 3-4-3, with Cesc Fàbregas discarded and the roles of three key players clarified with thrilling results.At which point, enter David Luiz, defensive giant. Yes, that David Luiz, a player who has had a peculiar double-life, damned by his own relentlessly trumpeted mistakes and at the same time rewarded with ever more extravagant playing contracts. During the last World Cup in Brazil there was an airline advert that featured a zanily grinning David Luiz in full pilot’s outfit proudly inviting you to board his waiting jet, arguably the least reassuring passenger safety message ever devised.And yet he has been key to Chelsea’s recent stability, not just as a deep playmaker at the heart of that three but as the aggressive, spirited defensive leader he has always been in between the odd horrific performance. Aged 29 now, the only major club football medal to escape the world’s most expensive defender across European three countries is - so far - a Premier League title medal. Which is fairly steady going for a man routinely dismissed as a flake and a saboteur.Further upfield Eden Hazard has been liberated by the 3-4-3, allowed to operate in forward gear by a manager who has accepted his lack of cover rather than simply fuming at it like a disappointed stepdad. In 12 league games Hazard has made 52 successful dribbles, compared with 89 the whole of last season. He should pass his total of 36 shots in the whole of 2015-16 against Tottenham on Saturday. Against that Hazard has made just four tackles. But Chelsea are top, and their best player has rediscovered his lateral spring, the ability to take the ball and turn in a single movement.David Luiz holds back to ensure Chelsea’s defence stays unbreached | Michael Cox Read moreVictor Moses, high-class wing-back, has been the most obvious gain. Moses is also the epitome of a common trait among the insurgent Conte-Klopp-Guardiola managerial type, the ability to make good use of the things that they find, recycling some talented but dormant part into a key component. Like James Milner’s fine turn at left-back, or Guardiola’s tweaking of key creative midfielders, Moses has been Conte’s own Womble-player, an itinerant winger and No10 across five English clubs before the age of 25 but now in the best period of his career as a powerful and utterly committed right wing-back.The sudden surge of eviscerating form, sparked by a decisive switch of shape, is nothing new in a Conte team. There are parallels with his first season at Juventus in 2011-12, where 14 of his first 27 Serie A matches were drawn but Juve ended up winning the title unbeaten in the league. Conte had been desperate to fit the thrillingly energetic Arturo Vidal into his team. In late September Vidal finally made the starting XI, Juve ran through Milan in Turin, a new 4-3-3 shape was up and running and Conte was on his way to a hat-trick of titles.As with Juve that year the lack of European football looks a significant advantage for Chelsea. There is an idea that the major plus here is to do with fatigue or injury, but managers talk instead of simply having those extra two days to plan and drill their players. Such is the way of the modern coach. In contract with the old Alex Ferguson-era idea of momentum, winning teams rolling on with the same system, combinations ever-more grooved under pressure, it is the interventionist, hands-in-the-cake-mix tendencies of the modern breed that stand out.Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action Read moreConte is obsessed with the fitness and physicality of his players, talking constantly with his medical staff, brooding over sprockets and hinges like an F1 pit boss, shifting his team on reports of twinges and twangs. Similarly the hands-on nature of Jurgen Klopp’s coaching has been noted, the tendency to physically haul players around the training pitch, something Ron Greenwood could be seen doing at West Ham in the 1970s.Klopp’s Liverpool experienced their first little gulp this weekend, as Southampton set out to defend against a slightly depleted team. Like a batsman who comes out and hits a flurry of fours, then has to change gear as the field drops back, Klopp will now look to adjust, to pick up the ones and twos, to hold Liverpool’s attacking fire for the right moment.No doubt the same process of reeling in and counter-adjustment will hit Chelsea in the coming weeks as opposition managers find a way to get behind the wing-backs or to harry David Luiz as Middlesbrough did on Sunday. Chelsea’s next two opponents are Tottenham and Manchester City. This evolving team may find life less comfortable against similar high-intensity machines, fellow hard-pressers. But a year on from the last days of José they can at least be sure they will not fail for want of sheer, thrilling focus.TopicsChelseaAntonio ContePremier LeaguefeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Much like the felines from which she draws inspiration, it would be fair to say that Catwoman tends to split opinion. For every memory of Michelle Pfeiffer’s purring PVC-clad kitty, or Anne Hathaway’s slinky, stylish real-world cat burglar, there are those who recall Halle Berry’s cheesy, basketball-playing, milk-supping Patience Phillips iteration, which still stands as one of the most painful renderings of a classic comic-book icon in Hollywood history. Worse still, the execrable 2004 effort is almost entirely responsible for the view among studio executives that female-led superhero movies are bad for business – which in turn is the reason Patty Jenkins’ upcoming Wonder Woman will be the first film of its kind to hit multiplexes in more than a decade.You might wonder then, why Sienna Miller is willing to risk her resurgent career on portraying Catwoman in the new DC Extended Universe (DCEU), especially given the critical hammering handed out to early efforts Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad. For, according to a tweet over the weekend from Erik Davis, managing editor of US ticketing site Fandango, the British actor is so keen to pull on the fake leathers that she’s willing to write her own part for Ben Affleck’s upcoming solo movie The Batman.ErikDavis (@ErikDavis)Sienna Miller told me tonight that she wants to play Catwoman in Affleck's Batman movie. "She's not in the script but I wanna write her in!"November 19, 2016Davis’s tweet also suggests Affleck has no intention of including Selina Kyle, the original, classic Catwoman, in his movie. But that doesn’t mean she won’t turn up further down the line, and most likely in a rather different form to the one in which we last saw her on the big screen, in Hathaway’s elegant portrayal in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises.For if there’s one thing we do know about the DCEU, it’s that, for better or for worse, this is a universe in which superpowers and the supernatural are firmly back on the table following the more realistic rendering of Gotham and its inhabitants in Nolan’s films. Any film series that can find room for villains spawned from zombie General Zod and Lex Luthor’s DNA (Dawn of Justice’s Doomsday), and an ancient, apparently immortal witch (Cara Delevingne’s Enchantress in Suicide Squad) is hardly going to balk at a little feline reincarnation. Expect to see a Catwoman whose alter ego is once again spawned when she is murdered by her boss: it’s the version filmgoers know best, and has that frisson of freakiness that has so far been the DCEU’s one defining characteristic.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Is Miller the right woman for the job? Well, why not? She’s back in the limelight following a celebrated turn in American Sniper and has a role in Affleck’s forthcoming thriller Live By Night. If the 44-year-old actor-director does bring back Batman’s on-off lover, he’ll probably want to cast somebody in at least their mid-30s (Miller is 34), as picking anyone younger would be creepy.The British actor should perhaps be wary, however. Catwoman almost killed Berry’s career, only two years after she won an Oscar for her performance in Monster’s Ball. Margot Robbie and Amy Adams haven’t suffered from taking underwritten roles as Harley Quinn and Lois Lane in Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, but Delevingne is surely kicking herself for ever agreeing to play gyrating villain Enchantress in the latter. Could Margot Robbie's all-female superhero movie be DC's trump card? Read moreMoreover, the DCEU’s position on Gotham’s female superheroes is unclear. Will it ultimately adopt the empowering perspective that typified comic-book writer Gail Simone’s pioneering run on Batgirl, or slip into the tired, sexist tropes of the likes of Frank Miller – whose defining act on the seminal 1987 graphic novel Batman: Year One was to reimagine Kyle as a prostitute? Affleck, judging by his recent output, is unlikely to continue the policy of objectification that led to so many complaints about Quinn’s treatment in Suicide Squad, and there has been talk of a Robbie-led all-female superhero movie featuring Quinn, Batgirl, Birds of Prey, Poison Ivy, Katana and Bumblebee. But the jury remains out.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest The best versions of Catwoman over the years have always been sexy but empowered. Bob Kane, Batman’s creator, said he modelled Kyle’s costume on a cat because he wanted the character to be “cool, detached, and unreliable … as hard to understand as women are”. But as sexist as such a reading seems in 2016, it is this wily duplicity that makes Catwoman so intriguing. She is very much her own kitty cat, with her own compulsions and desires. To Batman, Kyle’s unwillingness to toe the line may seem like a mark of deceit, but to Selina herself it is simply sensible self-interest.As such, Catwoman would surely make a welcome addition to the DCEU. Let us hope she gets her ninth life on the big screen sooner rather than later.TopicsMoviesWeek in geekSuperhero moviesBatmanblogpostsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
On a fine Saturday morning, the music school in Vicente Guerrero is abuzz with preparations for the debut concert of its chamber orchestra: in one shady corner, a group of fledgling clarinetists are practising breathing exercises; in the courtyard, the cello section are rehearsing scales; nearby, a flute lesson for five schoolgirls is under way.What makes this idyllic scene so remarkable is Vicente Guerrero’s location on the edge of a vast rubbish dump. The community, in one of Mexico’s poorest states, has a reputation for drug abuse and gang violence. But it is undergoing a transformation after a fortuitous encounter with a French pilot helped launch a musical venture offering rare hope to its youth. Event: Maintaining the momentum for the SDGs – Latin America Read moreVicente Guerrero is just 10 miles south of Oaxaca, a former colonial city where tourists flock, but it is a world away from the pre-Columbian ruins and world-famous cuisine. City officials opened the rubbish dump in the 1980s on what was then uninhabited wasteland. Over the years, poor families – mostly migrants from across Mexico and Central America – constructed makeshift houses on the fringes of the gaping landfill, and the neighbourhood is now home to 13,000 people.But Vicente Guerrero still has few basic services. It has many churches, but just one health clinic and one paved road. Graffiti marks almost every building.The music school opened in 2011 as part of a violence-prevention programme set up by the local Catholic church. Camerino Lopez, 33, a clarinet player from Oaxaca’s indigenous Zapoteco region, was recruited to lead the project. Its first year, 25 students learned to read music and tapped out rhythms on empty buckets and chairs.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Armando Juarez, 13, tuba player. Photograph: Ginnette Riquelme for the Guardian“The community’s reputation was so bad that that at first no other music teachers would come here,” said Lopez. “People joked that in Vicente Guerrero they kill for free. Now that’s changing, and people feel proud.”Change started when Isabelle de Boves, a French pilot, came to visit her elderly aunt, a nun who lived nearby. Impressed by the makeshift music school, de Boves began collecting unwanted instruments from friends and relatives back home. Within a couple of months she sent her first shipment: 21 trumpets, trombones, clarinets and saxophones.“From the first time I met the children, they had stars in [their] eyes, and spoke about their dreams as musicians,” said De Boves. “Their parents are good people: they fight for this project, selling tortillas after mass every Sunday to buy instruments. They didn’t expect anything and were not used to receiving help.”Since then, De Boves has organised countless benefit concerts in Paris to buy instruments, fund scholarships, and send musicians to give classes at the school, which was built by the parents using materials paid for by Air France’s charitable foundation.The school, which now has 100 students, has become a focal point of the community and even the most sceptical parents are allowing their children to attend. Armando Júarez, 13, is the only sousaphone player – and one of the school’s most challenging pupils. He joined last year around the same time he dropped out of primary school, where he was in constant trouble for skipping classes and talking back to the teachers.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Rigoberto, 15, plays the cello. Photograph: Ginnette Riquelme for the Guardian“I preferred hanging out in the streets and doing graffiti with my friends,” said Júarez, whose antics led to frequent fights with boys in other neighbourhoods.Júarez is shy, short-tempered and just the kind of youngster the school was set up to serve. He has never met his father, his mother works long hours to make ends meet, and his cousins are involved with local gangs.“Music relaxes me,” says Júarez. “I’ve made new friends here, I hardly hang out on the streets anymore.”The school now boasts 165 instruments and an impressive workshop run by local woman Patricia García, 25, who gained a scholarship to study instrument repair in Paris. Most students pay 60 pesos (£2.50) per week, but those from the poorest families attend for free.Oaxaca has a rich musical history and most neighbourhoods have brass bands that perform at parties and religious functions. The Vicente Guerrero school band is now gaining a reputation and plays at masses, festivals, community events – and most recently at the city’s children’s hospital.

It makes its debut on Tuesday as part of International Music Day celebrations.On a recent morning, Vanessa Silva Vásquez, 8, was trying her best to grasp finger placements for the flute. She really wanted to play the saxophone, but her front tooth fell out and its replacement is stubbornly refusing to come through. Until that happens, the sax is out of the question. Nonetheless, she diligently attends classes six days a week.Vásquez’s parents moved from the coast 10 years ago to find work. “I never had the chance to play an instrument but music can distract children, stop them getting into trouble,” said her mother, Maria de Los Angeles Vásquez, 29. “It’s a long day after school, but Vanessa loves it and can’t wait till she’s good enough for the band.”Paraguayan landfill orchestra makes sweet music from rubbish Read moreMusic has buoyed this community’s collective sense of worth, and is opening doors for some of the children who are starting to believe in themselves.Florida Velasquez, 15, a talented clarinetist, was recently accepted at the prestigious Cecam indigenous music school, becoming the fifth Vicente Guerrero student to gain a place studying elsewhere.Her brother Octavio, 19, a percussionist, was also accepted to Cecam, but was forced to drop out to work as a builder to support his family. He still plays in the band.Velasquez still dreams of becoming a professional musician, and wants to buy her family a house. “Life has been really hard for us and I worry about my family all the time, but music helps me imagine life outside of this neighbourhood – and think about a different future.”TopicsMexicoLatin America NowClassical musicAmericasWorking in developmentfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
You don’t have to spend long in bars or cabs around the country to know that nearly every Australian fan thinks he or she would do a better job of selecting the Test team than those presently tasked with doing it.It’s a role that looks easy from the outside but has time and time again made mugs of cricket sages. Take Australia’s last three chairmen of selectors. Former Test opener and lawyer Andrew Hilditch seemed right-thinking and diligent for much of his reign as the country’s last part-time selection boss and brought with him some empathy having been a fringe player in a transitional Test side himself. But he will always be remembered for being railroaded by Cricket Australia marketing apparatchiks into naming a dithering 17-man squad for a single home Ashes Test and then losing the series convincingly. Hilditch was gone from the job within a year, buried under a duluge of criticism and, you’d imagine, a mountain of overlooked paperwork from his day job.Australia's cricket cull: a genuine new era or merely another short-term fix? | Sam Perry Read moreSo Cricket Australia finally moved with the times and went for a full-timer, appointing cerebral and schoolmasterly John Inverarity, who appeared at first like one of those existentialist European football managers, until he started picking the uninspiring likes of John Hastings and Rob Quiney in important home Tests. Those were among a series of head-scratchers that made people forget Inverarity’s fortitude in sticking by David Warner, resurrecting both Mitchell Johnson and Chris Rogers, while empowering limited overs star George Bailey. For most of his tenure he was viewed as the nutty professor of Australian cricket, and a sense of relief greeted his succession by salty and old fashioned Rod Marsh.We all know how that went. Marsh returned as a macho purveyor of common sense, and had long been renowned for calling a spade a spade. Then he caught a glimpse of Mitchell Marsh. By the second Test of his third summer in charge, one of Australia’s last great alpha males was huddled behind a glass partition at Bellerive Oval like some fretful grandfather watching his whole family being operated on by Dr Nick Riviera. Marsh’s early, self-imposed departure from the job might actually have received a little more praise for its selfless and accurate reading of the national mood.The lineage of these men and the long-range impacts of their decisions are not often considered in totality, but the concept of the selector as hate figure stretches right back to 1912 and Peter McAlister, the man who felt national captain Clem Hill’s wrath during a selection meeting in an office overlooking Sydney’s Martin Place. “You have been asking for a punch on the jaw all night, and I’ll give you one,” fumed Hill as he lunged across the table and did just that, biffing his adversary before an impromptu wrestle nearly sent McAlister flying out one of the room’s windows. It’s no wonder then that only one prominent Australian selector has ever written at length about his experience (John Benaud in 1997’s Matters of Choice) nor created a definitive manual – selectors rarely last long enough and the experience of such a thankless task tends to embitter even hardy souls. Benaud himself had once famously made selectors look stupid, belting 142 in the Melbourne Test of 1972-73 in furious reaction to the news he’d been left out of the team for the next game.As Mike Brearley once said, selectors are a bit like families – only acknowledged when there is blame to apportion. We hammer them for picking the Quineys, Mennies and Mullers of the world, but then ascribe the successes of our Warnes and Waughs to the intestinal fortitude and talent of the player alone, not the foresight and courage of the men who identified their ability and then stood by it against prevailing public opinion.Solve Australia's cricket crisis: pick your own Adelaide Test team and coach Read moreCurrently in the hot seat on a fill-in basis is Trevor Hohns, who last held the top job in 2006, after a reign in which the toughest decisions were identifying which of Brad Hodge, Martin Love, Matthew Elliott or Michael Bevan could tag along on overseas tours as a reserve batsman. With the first Test team of his current stint he has certainly entered into the spirit of the national debate, making six changes, which probably would have swelled by another if NSW spinner Steve O’Keefe was fit enough to replace Nathan Lyon.The rest of us can’t make up our minds, nor agree on anything close to a consensus team. Only 14% of the 3,439 respondents to a Guardian Australia poll had Nic Maddinson in their ideal Test side, and for all the umbrage at wicketkeeper Peter Nevill’s demotion, only 38% of respondents gave him the nod as opposed to 41.8% for Matthew Wade – a result which contradicts the tenor of comments sections and talk radio chatter around the country when the topic of Wade’s glovework is broached.The only “locks” readers established were captain Steve Smith (97% approval), David Warner (96%), Mitchell Starc (94%), Usman Khawaja (89%) and Josh Hazlewood (87%). The drop-off between them and every other candidate was drastic (Peter Handscomb came in next, picked in 60% of teams) and in line with the dramatic overhaul the actual selectors have settled on.Of the batsmen, Guardian voters picked all of Glenn Maxwell, Shaun Marsh, George Bailey, Cameron Bancroft, Travis Head, Kurtis Patterson, Joe Burns and Callum Ferguson ahead of Maddinson and Matt Renshaw, which was fair in the latter case, as we didn’t even include the 12-game first class rookie among our extensive list of options. Australians were in accord on only one other issue: that flow charts and Sun Tzu quotes no longer belong on the team whiteboard. So John Buchanan received only 4% of the vote for the coaching job.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   National selector Mark Waugh (left) and now-departed chairman of selectors Rod Marsh look on as Australia struggle through day three of the Hobart Test. Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty ImagesBut all of this guesswork and debate glosses over grander themes of Australian cricket we’ve long ignored, perhaps because they’re so hard to fully comprehend at a distance; primarily the structural changes to the game at club and state level in the past two decades, and the legacy of those changes with respect to performances at Test level.Until the 1990s, the rough and tumble path to international cricket was via hardboiled grade cricket, the Lord of the Flies world of state second XIs and an uncompromising Sheffield Shield competition. Yet in the fully professionalised, managerial age of the 1990s, this tried and true method was binned off for “pathways” programs, centres of “excellence” and the state Future’s League, the latter of which sounded sci-fi in a good way when it was first introduced, but is now being reappraised by some close observers as sitting within the genre of dystopian fiction.Cricket Australia can’t say nobody foresaw the consequences of those dramatic changes to the structure of the game at elite levels. Well into old age Richie Benaud was an evangelist for grade cricket’s virtues and maintained the lifelong habit of checking the papers for the progress of promising batsmen in NSW grade ranks. In 1997 he remarked: “I have never lost the belief that the Australian game completely revolves around the club matches which are the prelude for some to the Sheffield Shield.”There was also this from Gideon Haigh in Wisden back in 2005, when Australian cricket still felt content with itself:  There are strains in Australian cricket, too, that are deeper and longer-term. For much of the country’s cricket history, for example, the first grade or district clubs has been the game’s principal organising unit, talent nursery and social institution... But the reality is that Test players now have precious little to do with their clubs, and nor, increasingly, do promising juniors, given the sophistication of youth cricket programs designed to identify and incubate talent. The implications of this steadily attenuating connection between cricket’s higher and lower levels, with a concentration of riches and resources in the elite game may not be apprehended for a generation.Well, that generation is now upon us, and the outlook is indeed grim. Australian cricket’s problems stretch far further down the supply chain than the men whose job it is to formulate the Test team. What is beyond question is that for a good 15 years, the loosely-defined concepts of “talent” and “potential” have trumped the traditional measuring sticks of actual output and consistency. Hence in the last decade Australia has picked as its national Under-19 captain a batsman with only one century to his name in any form of cricket, and on Sunday elevated another to Test ranks who had not scored more than a single century in a Sheffield Shield summer since his debut season of 2010-11. In the five Australian summers before this one, Nic Maddinson has averaged 26.20, 53.66, 27.30, 35.46 and 39.72 respectively. Australia make six changes in drastic selection shake-up for third Test Read moreFor the latter type of selection there should be fewer reservations about probing the thought processes of selectors. What can really be expected from Maddinson at Test level, and how confident can we be in the soundness of such selection strategies? Said Hohns on Sunday: “We see him as a player of enormous potential. He is definitely a game breaker and if we can get the best out of him at that [Test] level as I think we can, he could be a very, very important player for us down the track.”A game breaker? Who watching the shemozzle at Hobart thought this Australian team was crying out for a game-breaker, anyway? Aren’t there any game-steadiers left in Sheffield Shield cricket? The most telling phrase Hohns used here was “if we can get the best out of him”, which is a most unfortunate motif for all of Australian cricket of this era. After all, Maddinson has already shown he can’t get the best out of himself, or if he can, it’s clearly not good enough. “Patience will be required,” Hohns said at one point on Sunday. But here was a man also admitting that for all the upheaval wrought on the Australian game in his lifetime, some things never change. “Sometimes,” Hohns conceded, “you do of course go with your gut.”TopicsCricketAustralia cricket teamAustralia sportfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Looking for fun on a rainy afternoon? Try this: take a blow-up globe down to your nearest public space – a shopping mall, perhaps, or a train station – and ask people to find Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous nation.I’ve tried it in London, New York and Rio. The response: “Uuuuuuuhh …”Much stroking of chins and scratching of heads. “Somewhere around here, maybe,” accompanied by vague hand gestures towards Indochina or south Asia.If you’re in Melbourne or Sydney you may have more luck. But even there, interest in Indonesia per se is muted. In the words of an editor at Penguin Australia: “Despite [Indonesia] being a profoundly important near neighbour of ours, I feel our market would need an Australian angle on the country.”Despite being a country of superlatives – most populous Muslim-majority nation, biggest exporter of numerous commodities dug or grown out of its generous earth, one of the world’s most enthusiastic users of Twitter and Facebook – Indonesia also remains, in the words of Indonesian businessman John Riady, the biggest invisible thing on the planet.This is despite the cheerleading of brokers and business consultants who point to Indonesia’s young population, its rapid urbanisation and its huge market of enthusiastic consumers as reasons for foreign investors to pay it more attention.I’ve been hearing those same arguments since I first covered Indonesia for Reuters and the Economist in the late 1980s. Over the intervening three decades, per-capita income in Indonesia did indeed rise steeply to $3,300, over five times its level when I first lived there. Having lived through 45 years of virtual dictatorship, Indonesians are now rowdily democraticWhich is great, but not as great as Thailand or Vietnam (between seven and eight times higher), let alone China (where per capita income is now close to $8,000 a year, 26 times its 1985 value).For a country that has such extraordinary natural resources, and such an abundance of labour, Indonesia is arguably underperforming economically. This is in part because the scatter of its 7,000 inhabited islands creates extraordinary infrastructure challenges, in part because a torpid bureaucracy squashes innovation, and in (large) part because Indonesia’s miasmic legal system means no contract is secure.The much vaunted “demographic dividend” will not deliver the pot of gold at the end of the Indonesian rainbow until all three of these things change. Now, for the first time since a brave but ill-prepared Indonesia declared its independence from Dutch colonists in 1945, at least two of these changes are under way. That’s no small achievement in a nation as kaleidoscopic as Indonesia, where there are almost as many ethnicities, languages and belief systems as there are islands. The improvements in both infrastructure and governance are especially worthy of global attention because they are being propelled by the twin engines of democracy and decentralisation, both relatively new to Indonesians.Having lived through 45 years of virtual dictatorship, Indonesians are now rowdily democratic, directly electing everyone from their village head up to the president. Some politicians still hand out cash for ballots, but Indonesian citizens even in the remotest villages have a remarkably acute understanding of the twists and turns of politics.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Jakarta governor Ahok campaigning for re-election. He has been named as a suspect in a blasphemy investigation. Photograph: Darren Whiteside/Reuters“They think we’re idiots, that they can buy our votes,” commented a fisherman in North Sulawesi last month of the politicians who are already campaigning ahead of next year’s district elections. “Of course we take the cash, we’ll take it from all of them, but we vote with our heads.” Political elites who expect bribery or blind populism to trump all else in Indonesia are often left flummoxed, and, increasingly, out of power.Indonesia’s democratic rebirth came with what some see as a second wave of decolonisation. For the first five and a half decades of its existence, the nation was firmly ruled from the capital Jakarta, largely for the benefit of the 60% of Indonesians who are squashed in to the single island of Java.The resentment this caused contributed to the 1998 downfall of the country’s second leader, Suharto, after 32 years in power. There followed a “big bang” decentralisation that turned Indonesia’s many geographic, cultural and ethnic fiefdoms from vassals of the central government in Jakarta into quasi-autonomous democracies. Political elites who expect bribery or blind populism to trump all else in Indonesia are often left flummoxedAmong the many votes Indonesians now cast, the one that affects their lives most directly is that for district head or mayor. Voters laughingly refer to these local potentates as “little Sultans” because they are so powerful. They make most of the important decisions about education, healthcare and local infrastructure; they dole out jobs and contracts, regulate entertainment, and negotiate the transport routes that are all-important in an island nation.Though Indonesia’s current president, Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, has made much of his support for infrastructure development, it is driven less by a well-planned push from Jakarta than by active demand from politicians directly elected in district and provincial governments. Though progress is slow, those demands are gradually overcoming the hurdles raised by the country’s geography.Decentralisation has had an effect on innovation-squashing bureaucracy also, though not all of it good. In many areas, district governments have simply pasted cumbersome new layers on to an already dysfunctional administrative system.Guardian Jakarta week – live Read moreBut in a few districts, adventurous politicians have experimented with radical reforms: they require civil servants to show up on time, to treat citizens with respect, to do their jobs without being bribed. These individuals have become local heroes and media darlings: their popularity has in many cases provided a springboard to higher office, including the presidency. Jokowi rose from small-town mayor to governor of Jakarta and on to the presidency on the strength of his no-nonsense approach to local government. However, neither decentralised democracy nor Jokowi himself have managed an assault on the third major hurdle to Indonesia’s self-actualisation: the legal quagmire referred to by his predecessor as the “judicial mafia”.The judiciary, still bruised after the 2013 conviction on corruption charges of the highest judge in the land, will be in the global spotlight again as it considers a blasphemy investigation opened against the Jakarta governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (known as Ahok).If he is charged, a transparent trial and a fair verdict would signal the beginning of improvements in the legal landscape. That, more than anything, would make Indonesia a country to watch in eager anticipation of a destiny of global greatness soon to be fulfilled.Elizabeth Pisani is author of Indonesia Etc: Exploring the Improbable NationIf you live or work in Jakarta, we’d love to hear from you.

In the fourth episode of Seinfeld’s ninth season, Kramer and George try to resell a pair of opera tickets and end up thwarted by their own greed.It’s a small moment of schadenfreude for anyone who has lost tickets or money to a scalper – but since that episode aired in 1992, the problem has got much, much worse. Last week in Australia Jerry Seinfeld unwittingly exposed how vulnerable fans are in a lightly regulated ticketing system that rips them off.After a two-day presale for Telstra customers, ticket sales to Seinfeld’s first Australian standup tour in close to 20 years opened to the public through Ticketek, with the cheapest tickets in Sydney priced at $81.40 and premium seats costing $203.60.Within minutes they were sold out. And within hours they were reselling on Australian resale sites including ViaGogo, Ticketblaster and Ticketmaster Resale, with some sellers on Ticketmaster Resale asking $2,298.85 for a ticket. The same is true for Adelaide and Melbourne. For the first show, in Perth, there was a pair on sale for $2,300, just to keep it simple; for Brisbane you could find them for $1,998.96.Danny Allen (@dpallen)#Seinfeld tickets already on eBay and Ticketmaster Marketplace for 400% markup! @Ticketek_AU + scalpers = average punters missing out 😔November 14, 2016Chris Phillips (@cr1spe)Seinfeld ticket scalpers, you just made my list.November 14, 2016“[Scalping] is generally seen as a really dishonest thing to do,” wrote one angry Facebook commenter. “It seems your Ticketmaster Resale website is a platform for this.”A self-described “huge Seinfeld fan”, the television critic and podcaster Dan Barrett missed out on Sydney tickets to Seinfeld and will have to fly to Brisbane to see the show. “It’s offensive to see large ticketing websites facilitating the scalping of tickets,” he said of the inflated costs available through resale sites. “It only encourages profiteering, leaving fans like myself unable to go.”A Ticketek spokesman echoed the criticism in a statement to Guardian Australia, urging fans to “avoid resale scalper websites”, calling them “predatory and misleading”.“There is no guarantee those tickets are genuine and you risk being ripped off. We see countless examples of people who buy from resale and never receive tickets or find that they are the third or fourth buyer of the same ticket. Fans should only purchase tickets from the official ticketing agent.”Ticketek v TicketmasterSome fans believe Ticketek exacerbated the Seinfeld frenzy by releasing some tickets to Telstra customers early under its commercial partnership – standard practice for many events, but one that reduced an already small pool of tickets available to the wider public on Monday. Customers and ticket sellers are also vulnerable to “bots” that buy tickets in high volume at high speed then flip them on to reselling sites – often before a concert, musical or sporting event has even sold out. A Ticketek spokesman said bot activity “wasn’t a significant factor” in the Seinfeld tour, which was more about “a huge demand and a limited number of tour dates and available tickets”. But, he said, Ticketek was “always vigilant” about bots and had invested “considerable technical effort and funds” to defend against them. But others are pointing the finger at Ticketmaster, Ticketek’s rival ticketing agent, which appears to be selling Seinfeld tickets for the greatest markups through its reselling arm, Ticketmaster Resale, and making a small fortune from the scalped tickets.  In one receipt sourced by Guardian Australia, the seller was charged more than 21% by Ticketmaster ResaleLive Nation Entertainment group is the global parent company of Ticketmaster, Ticketmaster Resale and the promotions and touring company Live Nation. In its annual report, its chief executive, Michael Rapino, trumpeted the company’s reselling platforms as a “major focus” now in operation in 13 countries. Reselling for Live Nation Entertainment enjoyed 34% growth in gross transaction value last year, amounting to US$1.2bn – and continuing to “grow the volume of secondary tickets sold” forms part of the company’s strategy.While Ticketmaster Resale has not released the amount of revenue it is taking from the $1.2bn in transactions, it’s likely to be a lot. Speaking to Guardian Australia, a Ticketmaster spokeswoman said every transaction incurred a 15% fee from the buyer and a 10% fee from the seller – meaning Ticketmaster Resale makes 25% on each transaction. With Ticketmaster Resale taking at least 25% on each transaction, the higher the inflation charged by the seller, the higher its profit. In the extreme example of a $2,300 Seinfeld ticket, it means the company would accrue at least $575 for merely handling the deal.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   This week tickets for Adele’s first Australian tour go on sale. The singer has been waging war against scalpers. Photograph: Yui Mok/PAIn the case of the Live Nation tours that are sold through Ticketmaster and resold through Ticketmaster Resale, Live Nation Entertainment is not only profiting from scalpers’ inflated prices but effectively double dipping, making money on the primary sale and all secondary sale fees and charges. Responding to this claim, Live Nation sent a statement: “Live Nation Australia [the Australian branch of the global company] does not participate in any revenues or fees that may be generated through the Ticketmaster Resale program.” Ticketmaster refused to comment on this.This week will represent another highlight in the scalpers’ calendar, when tickets for Adele’s first Australian shows go on sale. Promoters believe this sale will outstrip the nearest comparison: AC/DC’s tour last year. But Adele – along with acts such as Iron Maiden, Mumford and Sons and Violent Soho – has been one of those waging a war against scalping, which puts money in the pocket of scalpers – not artists – at the expense of an artist’s fans. We verify and reissue every ticket sold by fans … The seat you buy is always the seat you getTicketmaster ResaleWho is the touring company for Adele? Live Nation. And the official ticket agent for Adele’s shows in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth? Ticketmaster. Perhaps that’s why Ticketmaster has confirmed to Guardian Australia that Adele tickets will not be listed on Ticketmaster Resale. Live Nation works for its artists, after all. Ticketek is handling the sales for the Sydney and Adelaide shows. Like other ticket resale companies around the country, Ticketmaster Resale stresses that its platform is “secure”: “We verify and reissue every ticket sold by fans … The seat you buy is always the seat you get,” it says on its website. “Ticketmaster Resale provides a safe and secure platform for fans to sell unwanted tickets and to purchase tickets for events that might otherwise be sold out,” Ticketmaster said in a statement to Guardian Australia. “Our Ticketmaster Resale marketplace offers the best solution for fans, as it provides a customer guarantee which protects fans when making a purchase.”Appetite for destructionTicketmaster Resale is a major player in the Australian secondary ticket industry, with ViaGogo, Queen of Tickets and Ticketblaster among a bunch of other resale platforms dealing in tickets to sporting and cultural events. Some resales, of course, are genuine: sellers may no longer be able to go to an event, and it’s not illegal for them to sell tickets on to buyers who can. But in reality these resale marketplaces are facilitating, and often profiting from, ticket scalping – and the fans are losing out.Buying tickets for big New York events is a 'fixed game', attorney general says Read moreTickets for Guns N’ Roses’ 2017 tour are now going for $2,300 on Ticketmaster Resale; Justin Bieber is listed on ViaGogo for $1474. One Nick Cave fan searched for tickets to the artist’s upcoming Australian tour and landed on ViaGogo’s site before the primary ticketseller’s homepage – thanks to some well-placed Google AdWords. In a rush, he spent $350 on two tickets, well above the general seating cost of $103 each, before receiving an itemised bill: he would pay a service charge of $54 per ticket, amounting to $458 in total. He received no confirmation of where he would be seated. Not only are users paying a premium price and a substantial fee for their ticket, but they are not even guaranteed entry. Many venues refuse resold tickets; many of the tickets sold aren’t legitimate; some ticket numbers are sold more than once; and some tickets – listed at a premium price in the vague “section A” – end up not only being the worst seats in section A, but among the worst in the house.Like other resellers, Ticketmaster Resale guarantees a 100% refund of the ticket price if the ticket is not accepted by the venue or promoter – but, also like other resellers, the company pockets the fees regardless. The law What can be done? Australia’s federal consumer laws protect customers against misleading or deceptive conduct – but the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission says selling tickets at inflated pricing is in itself not in breach of federal laws. We are also watching … the situation in the US and the UK, where there are advanced plans to criminalise the use of botsTicketekSome forms of scalping are illegal in some states and at particular venues – but according to a report on scalping introduced to parliament by Senator Nick Xenophon in 2014, the state-based legislation is complicated, inconsistent and ineffective.“We hate it … we’re against it,” the music industry heavyweight Michael Gudinski told the Herald Sun. “Some of the prices I’ve seen are extreme, and it doesn’t go to the artists or the promoters. It’s a great frustration and I think the ACCC should look at it.”Live Performance Australia is the peak body for the nation’s live performance industry, and its chief executive, Evelyn Richardson, said the secondary ticket market was a key issue right now. “We’re looking at it as we speak,” she told Guardian Australia.In Australia, solutions are likely to include a mix of self-regulation within the industry, and better government regulation of technological developments such as automated software and bots.

Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images for CoachellaIn September Xenophon revived his fight to get the federal government to legislate against these bots – a fight Ticketek endorses.“We are also watching closely the situation in the US and the UK, where there are advanced plans to criminalise the use of bots to acquire and sell tickets,” the Ticketek spokesman said.Live Performance Australia endorses laws against bots too, which might be difficult to enforce but will at least send a message. “There has always been ticket scalping and people profiteering from buying tickets on the primary market, but now there are more ways for scalpers to quickly flip them and get them on to the secondary market … and a greater variety of platforms for people to resell,” Richardson said. “Ticketing companies themselves invest a lot of technical resources and money into defending against bots, and they will continue to do that as the technology gets more sophisticated.”In the US, Congress is considering legislation to curb bot activity (“I did not want to pay $800 [for a Hamilton] ticket,” a Florida Democratic senator, Bill Nelson, said in a hearing); and the UK is awaiting a government response to a secondary ticketing review which was published in May – as the #toutsout campaign gains steam. I say this to people I know: find out the venue or the promoter … and check out their siteEvelyn Richardson, Live Performance AustraliaRichardson stressed that while Australia was watching for potential solutions, its industry functioned differently. The commonality was that “the resale market is a growing market” – but Australia’s solution, she said, was “clunky at the moment”.“With respect to large-scale profiteering, that is a challenge and I think we’ll see technological solutions to it,” she said. “We’re seeing internationally – and even in Australia – a move to paperless tickets and other ways of controlling the inventory so that scalpers can’t get access to it … Increasingly, venues and promoters are looking at how they can respond, how they can control it, and manage it in a more effective way.”Buyer bewareBots are just one of the technological factors at play; another is Google AdWords, which are paid for by resale sites to prioritise their listings over the primary sellers.According to the Ticketek spokesman, within 48 hours of the Guns N’ Roses tour going on sale in August there were 9,000 tickets available on the resale market, worth almost $4m.The concert itself had not yet sold out through Ticketek – meaning people were finding the reseller links first, thanks to ads on Google, and buying tickets at inflated prices well before they needed to.In the case of the Seinfeld shows, those Google ads looked like this:      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest With the branding of sites such as Ticketmaster Resale not dissimilar to that of Ticketmaster itself – and with many resale listings not showing a ticket’s original price – many customers don’t realise they are purchasing a ticket through a secondary source for more money than it is worth.Defenders of sites such as Ticketmaster Resale say they themselves offer a protection against a growth in ticket fraud, facilitated by digital technology. Their big markups merely cover fraud protection and customer care, and the guarantee that fake tickets will be refunded. But until there is a better regulatory system, Richardson said the onus was on the buyer.“It is very much a case of buyer beware,” she said. “Know where you’re buying your ticket from. If you’re buying on a secondary site, you can’t be sure that the ticket you’re buying is a valid ticket. “If it’s for a show where the promoter or the venue say you can’t resell, then they reserve the right to cancel the ticket – and they may do that. And if you bought it on a secondary site, then getting a refund is going to be difficult.”How the ticket touts get away with bleeding fans dry Read moreThe issue was one of education, Richardson said. “Does the customer understand that they’re paying a premium price, and they’re paying a commission fee? If they understand that and they still make that choice, then that’s an informed choice. But I think the issue that we’re focused on is insuring that the consumer is properly informed.”Richardson recommended that customers add an extra step to their ticket purchasing. “I say this to people I know: find out the venue or the promoter who is the primary authorised seller and check out their site,” she said. That’s where you’ll find the promoter’s official ticketing partner and bypass the misleading Google result.“From an industry perspective, we’re very mindful of some of the challenges that [digital scalping] raises and we’re looking at how we can respond to those as quickly as we can. But, in the meantime, the consumer needs to be diligent about checking where they are buying their ticket from.”Do you have an experience of ticket resales to share?

In early 2010, artist, activist and mother, Persephone Pearl, headed to the Bristol Museum. Like many concerned about the fate of the planet, she was in despair over the failed climate talks in Copenhagen that winter. She sat on a bench and looked at a stuffed animal behind glass: a thylacine. Before then, she’d never heard of the marsupial carnivore that went extinct in 1936.“Here was this beautiful mysterious lost creature locked in a glass case,” she said. “It struck me suddenly as unbearably undignified. And I had this sudden vision of smashing the glass, lifting the body out, carrying the thylacine out into the fields, stroking its body, speaking to it, washing it with my tears, and burying it by a river so that it could return to the earth.”Pearl felt grief, deep grief, over the loss of a creature she’d never once seen in life, a species that had been shot to extinction because European settlers had deemed it vermin. Yet, how do we grieve for extinct species when there are no set rituals, no extinction funerals, no catharsis for the pain caused by a loss that in many ways is simply beyond human comprehension? We have been obliterating species for over ten thousand years – beginning with the megafauna of the Pleistocene like woolly rhinos, short-faced bears and giant sloths – yet we have no way of mourning them.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Martha flies again. Martha was the world’s last passenger pigeon, who perished on September 1, 1914. Once the most populous bird on the planet, passenger pigeons vanished remarkably quickly due to overhunting and habitat destruction. In 2014, mourners carried this model up Mount Caburn and burned it in a pyre. Photograph: Robin TaylorStill, Pearl didn’t push the grief under or ignore it. Instead, she sought to share it. In 2011 Pearl, who is the co-director of the arts group, ONCA, and the theatre group Feral in Brighton, helped organise the first ever Remembrance Day for Lost Species. Held every November 30th, it’s since become a day for activists, artists and mourners to find creative ways to share their grief for extinct species – and reinvigorate their love for the natural world. “We hope the Remembrance events will function as funerals for humans do,” Rachel Porter, a co-founder of Remembrance Day for Lost Species and a movement therapist, said. “Such rituals are ancient, embedded within us. We are just placing this common ritual into an unfamiliar context.”Most of these events are not large – they are not thousands of people marching on government buildings – but more like the number of people who would attend a funeral for a loved one. They are communal and largely intimate events, full of things you might expect and others you might not: such as burning pyres, chanting, poetry reading, bell tolling and processionals. Frog goes extinct, media yawns Read moreBut there are no rules to the Remembrance Day for Lost Species and anyone can start a public event or hold a private ceremony. This year, they are going on all over the world, including a dinner for the dodo in London, a poetry reading in Berlin, and a remembrance ritual for the thylacine outside of Brisbane, Australia. Graphic designer and art therapist Julia Peddie, who is hosting the thylacine ritual in Australia this year, said she remembers as a child first learning about how humans wiped out the dodo – and how the knowledge crushed her. “I can only imagine how children feel now, witnessing such enormous losses, and wonder if they are desensitising in order to cope,” she said. “Remembrance Day for Lost Species provides an opportunity for children and adults to connect with their grief, and in doing so, reclaim a part of themselves.” The vitality of griefBut let’s be honest, many of us probably find the idea of attending a funeral or walking in a processional for a vanished species a little foolish. It may even make us feel something more profound: vulnerable. But Pearl said this is only to be expected. “If grieving for a lost person is difficult, grieving for ecosystems and species is entirely novel and challenging.”  A memorial to extinct species outside Whitehall in 2010 created by Persephone Pearl, Jessie Martelhof, and Thomas Daniell. Photograph: Persephone PearlShe said that as a global society we have lost the knowledge of how to grieve even for our closest loved ones, quoting teacher and author Stephen Jenkinson who writes that our society is “death phobic and grief illiterate.”“We struggle to talk about death and dying,” Pearl said. “It is seen as a terrible thing, to be avoided at all costs. We are afraid of upsetting people, and of awkward conversations.” But at what cost? According to Porter, our inability to show grief – or even allow ourselves to feel it – may lead to mental illness.“The grief might become misplaced if it’s not recognised and misguided grief could be destructive, it could manifest as depression or anxiety.” We need to imagine and invent new rituals for the Anthropocene.Persephone PearlIn contrast, displaying grief can result in catharsis. In an emotional process first described by Aristotle over 2,000 years ago, pent up, intense feelings are allowed safe release through ritual. Afterwards, mourners are able to move forward, maybe even with more wisdom than before.  “Actual grief is hardly practiced today,” Megan Hollingsworth, a poet and founder of the collaborative art project ex·tinc·tion wit·ness, said. “If it were, children would neither be murdered in war nor would they go hungry and homeless in the streets of the world’s ‘wealthiest’ nations. Water would be protected. The desires of ‘grown’ men and women would not ever trump the needs of any single child, let alone whole communities.”Hollingsworth, also one of the founders of the Remembrance Day for Lost Species, will be holding a bell tolling ceremony in Montana on the 30th. Tear your hair for the extinctBut grief doesn’t occur only when we lose loved ones. Ask anyone who has seen a local forest they once played in as a child demolished for another cookie-cutter development or has watched as fewer bees and butterflies show up in their garden each summer. Or ask any conservationist who has to witness year-after-year as the species they work with slowly vanish, ask any marine biologist about coral reefs or any Arctic biologist about sea ice. Grief can extend far beyond our human parochialism.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A ceremony for the Caribbean monk seal, which was last seen in 1952. From Remembrance Day for Lost Species in 2012. Photograph: Ben Ellsworth“We realised that there was a hunger for a way of grieving ecological loss through ritual,” said Porter who in 2011 directed a Funeral for Lost Species through her group, Feral Theatre. This was an outdoor theatrical performance in a churchyard that included various traditional forms of mourning and tilted between somber and whimsical.  Grief can provide a pathway for taking responsibility, and making a commitment to take action.Julia PeddiePorter believes many people are simply “stuck in a kind of denial” when it comes to extinction, biodiversity loss and environmental crises. “If we face it honestly and fully we have to face our own collective shadow, our out-of-control destructive urges and acts. These are terrible, terrifying things to face alone,” she said. Part of this denial is also due to our growing disconnect from nature. “Many humans now solely interact with domesticated animals and plants. Some have no experience whatsoever of intact forest, field, and aquatic community. The total loss of other community members, their families, and life affirming ways then is an utterly distant abstraction,” Hollingsworth said. “Yet in grief, as in love, humans are wired for intimacy. “According to the founders of the Remembrance Day for Lost Species, grieving in a ritualised ceremony removes our isolation from other mourners – we are after all grieving communally – and cuts through the denial.“For those in denial bearing witness to acts of remembrance and honouring reminds them non-aggressively of something that they are pushing away. That is why making these rituals public is so very important,” Porter said. In the end such rituals may help people transform their perfectly understandable anger – which is “connected to the disregard and destruction of the natural world,” according to Porter – into something ultimately productive. Providing a real outlet for grief could help people finally take action and change the world for the better.  “Potentially, in our sadness, we can vow not to continue to let it happen, and acknowledge the role we humans are playing in causing the extinctions,” Peddie said. “Grief can provide a pathway for taking responsibility, and making a commitment to take action.”Such rituals also allow us to view extinction in a novel way. So much of the information we receive about extinctions and biodiversity decline today comes from science, not from personal experience in the wild. And while science is necessary, it is often represented in wonky papers or press release that are bloodless, cold, even inhuman – a recitation of facts rather than a proper elegy for the lost.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A processional for the great auk during the Remembrance Day for Lost Species in 2011. The great auk went extinct in 1844 after the last two known animals were killed violently by men seeking their eggs. The species was pushed to extinction by killing for its feathers, eggs and even to use as fishing bait. Photograph: Persephone Pearl“Telling the stories of recently extinct species is a way of capturing people’s imaginations to this end,” said Pearl. “It’s not science or statistics, it’s history, it’s real life – and in an age of cultural amnesia, storytelling inspired by historical events is a way to learn lessons from the past.”But many probably fear that allowing themselves to feel the grief – really feel it – will result in a personal collapse. Hollingsworth said that an environmental studies professor once told her: “‘I can’t think of this as grief. That would be endless.’”But this is “where the misconception lies,” according to Hollingsworth. Grieving doesn’t bring endless suffering, but healing and health. “What happens when I don’t grieve someone’s death? What does it mean not to feel or express sorrow when someone passes unnecessarily due to my negligence? Just the thought of this is chilling to me as the sociopath is brought to mind,” she said. Grief can be funny tooThis doesn’t mean such events have to be sombre and drowned in tears. No emotion is wrong, according to the founders of the Remembrance Day for Lost Species. They are not afraid to throw humour and whimsy into their rituals.  If you can make people laugh, you are halfway to love. You can take people to deep places.Persephone Pearl“Often at human funerals people share funny stories about the dead person and it gives a relief, a release from weight of loss, and it can bring a celebratory feel,” said Porter.Laughter can be incredibly powerful, even during a ritual mourning. “Humour allows us to softly break through denial and isolation, to damp down the tempers fire, to create space in between the agony, the fear, the chaos,” said Porter. Recently, Pearl attended the Stories of the Anthropocene Festival in Stockholm where she held a remembrance ceremony for the thylacine. Attendees were asked to share their stories about extinction – but first they had to step through a glitter curtain. “If you can make people laugh, you are halfway to love. You can take people to deep places. You can encourage them to take risks,” she said.But sombreness is okay, too, the founders insist. It all depends on what you are hoping to create within the context of the ritual. Grieving in the AnthropoceneLegend says the world’s last thylacine died cold and alone. The story is that it was mistakenly locked out of its nighttime quarters at the zoo in Hobart, Tasmania during an unusually cold night in 1936. The animal, which was never even identified as a male or female, perished from exposure. That was 80 years ago this year. While the last thylacine may not have actually died from the cold, it certainly died in a kind of loneliness that is almost impossible for humans – seven billion and rising – to comprehend. It was, after all, an endling. The last of its kind. And yet do we barely remember it, let alone weep for it.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A child visits the ‘grave’ of Bombus franklini, a bee that went extinct in 2006, during the Funeral for Lost Species. The memorial was made by Eri Meacock. Photograph: Abi HornJulia Peddie said the 80th Anniversary of the extinction of the thylacine “went fairly unnoticed in the mainstream media” even in its native Australia. Despite little media around the anniversary, Australia still has a lot of “nostalgia” for the thylacine, said Peddie, to the extent that some people believe it still inhabits the wild lands of Tasmania. Perhaps, this is a kind of denial in action, an inability to accept the extinction of what once was; a denial that may continue to allow Australians – and people around the world – to ignore the losses going on right in front of them. Australia is an epicentre of extinction. It has the highest mammal loss of any country on Earth. Since European arrival, the country has lost at least 30 species of mammal. And another was lost just this year: the Bramble Cay melomys, the world’s first mammal known to have gone extinct due to climate change. “The stories of lost species remind us that things do end, they do die, that we are causing irrevocable and deeply distressing changes – but that the ending’s not yet written for the stories of rhinoceros, of hedgehogs, of phytoplankton,” said Pearl. So, really, why don’t we grieve for the passenger pigeon, the golden toad, or the Yangtze River dolphin? Or how about Rabbs’ fringe-limbed tree frog which just vanished from the Earth in September? Why don’t we rend our garments for the woolly mammoth, or tear our hair for the dodo or smear our windows with ash for the great moas that once roamed New Zealand? It can’t hurt. It could only heal. “We need to imagine and invent new rituals for the Anthropocene,” said Pearl. “What would a memorial for the Caspian tiger or the elephant bird look like? A memorial for the Great Barrier Reef? For 350 parts per million of atmospheric CO2?”The age of the Anthropocene is an age of grief, put simply. Not showing, sharing or indeed feeling that grief will make it all the more unbearable. But a collective keening may be key to moving forward and creating a new society that fully respects and cherishes the millions of life forms that call this planet home.

Photograph: Mike Segar/ReutersPresident-elect Donald Trump has settled the multi-state class-action fraud lawsuit over the now-defunct Trump University for $25 million, according to New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman: In 2013, my office sued Donald Trump for swindling thousands of innocent Americans out of millions of dollars through a scheme known at Trump University. Donald Trump fought us every step of the way, filing baseless charges and fruitless appeals and refusing to settle for even modest amounts of compensation for the victims of his phony university. Today, that all changes. Today’s $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.I am pleased that under the terms of this settlement, every victim will receive restitution and that Donald Trump will pay up to $1 million in penalties to the State of New York for violating state education laws. The victims of Trump University have waited years for today’s result and I am pleased that their patience - and persistence - will be rewarded by this $25 million settlement.Donald Trump announced the nomination of Alabama senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general and Kansas congressman Mike Pompeo as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, as well as the selection of retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn to serve as his national security advisor.Sessions, one of Trump’s earliest backers during the Republican primary campaign, has served in the Senate since 1997, and served as Alabama’s attorney general for two years before that. The lawmaker has the rare distinction of once being passed over for a federal judgeship over racist comments he allegedly made. During Sessions’ confirmation hearing in 1986, lawmakers heard testimony that Sessions called respected civil rights organizations “communist inspired”. In another set of testimony, a prosecutor told Congress that Sessions had said he thought the Ku Klux Klan was “OK until I found out they smoked pot.”The feisty online campaign to persuade shoppers to boycott Ivanka Trump’s fashion products and the retailers that stock them, #GrabYourWallet, appears to be biting.

Ret. Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn. Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty ImagesIn 2009, Flynn followed his longtime friend from the elite Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), Stanley McChrystal, to Afghanistan. Their partnership had transformed JSOC into an apparatus that collected and disseminated intelligence as rapidly as it killed people, and then fed that intelligence back into its internal systems to accelerate the lethal process.As with JSOC, McChrystal would command the war and Flynn would run its intelligence shop. But Flynn soon considered the entire US intelligence apparatus in Afghanistan to be focusing on the wrong targets.The trouble, in Flynn’s estimation, was that US intelligence focused too much on the Taliban insurgency. It gave comparatively little emphasis on granular data about trends among Afghans themselves, which at the time the coterie of counterinsurgents around McChrystal considered decisive. Win the people, the thinking went, and the insurgency would lose the base of support necessary to survive.In a rare move for a serving intelligence officer, Flynn took his critique public.“The most salient problems [in Afghanistan] are attitudinal, cultural and human,” he wrote in a January 2010 paper for the Center for a New American Security, at that point the ascendant defense thinktank and a job pipeline into the Obama Pentagon. “[M]erely killing insurgents usually serves to multiply enemies rather than subtract them.”Commanders, Flynn and his co-authors wrote, needed information including “census data and patrol debriefs; minutes from shuras with local farmers and tribal leaders … polling data and atmospherics reports from psychological operations and female engagement teams.”Refocusing on “population-centric information”, the authors wrote, was crucial to victory. It would admittedly offer “few clues about where to find insurgents”, but it would “provide elements of even greater strategic importance – a map for leveraging popular support and marginalizing the insurgency itself”.The 2010 paper, which took many in intelligence circles by surprise, was the first time most outside the military had encountered Flynn.

Photograph: Carolyn Kaster/APMy book exposed a grubby secret of American higher education: that the rich buy their underachieving children’s way into elite universities with massive, tax-deductible donations. It reported that New Jersey real estate developer Charles Kushner had pledged $2.5m to Harvard University not long before his son Jared was admitted to the prestigious Ivy League school, which at the time accepted about one of every nine applicants. (Nowadays, it only takes one out of 20.)I also quoted administrators at Jared’s high school, who described him as a less-than-stellar student and expressed dismay at Harvard’s decision.“There was no way anybody in the administrative office of the school thought he would on the merits get into Harvard,’’ a former official at the Frisch school in Paramus, New Jersey, told me. “His GPA [grade point average] did not warrant it, his SAT scores did not warrant it. We thought, for sure, there was no way this was going to happen. Then, lo and behold, Jared was accepted. It was a little bit disappointing because there were at the time other kids we thought should really get in on the merits, and they did not.’’Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Kushner Companies, said in an email on Thursday that “the allegation’’ that Charles Kushner’s gift to Harvard was related to Jared’s admission “is and always has been false”. His parents, Charles and Seryl Kushner, “are enormously generous and have donated over $100m to universities, hospitals and other charitable causes. Jared Kushner was an excellent student in high school and graduated from Harvard with honours.’’ (About 90% of Jared’s 2003 class at Harvard also graduated with honours.)My Kushner discoveries were an offshoot of my research for a chapter on Harvard donors. Somebody had slipped me a document I had long coveted: the membership list of Harvard’s Committee on University Resources. The university wooed more than 400 of its biggest givers and most promising prospects by putting them on this committee and inviting them to campus periodically to be wined, dined and subjected to lectures by eminent professors.My idea was to figure out how many children of these corporate titans, oil barons, money managers, lawyers, high-tech consultants and old-money heirs had gone to Harvard. A disproportionate tally might suggest that the university eased its standards for the offspring of wealthy backers.I began working through the list, poring over Who’s Who in America and Harvard class reunion reports for family information. Charles and Seryl Kushner were both on the committee. I had never heard of them, but their joint presence struck me as a sign that Harvard’s fundraising machine held the couple in especially fond regard.The clips showed that Charles Kushner’s empire encompassed 25,000 New Jersey apartments, along with extensive office, industrial and retail space and undeveloped land. Unlike most of his fellow committee members, though, Kushner was not a Harvard man. He had graduated from New York University. This eliminated the sentimental tug of the alma mater as a reason for him to give to Harvard, leaving another likely explanation: his children.Sure enough, his sons Jared and Joshua had both enrolled there.How did ‘less than stellar’ high school student Jared Kushner get into Harvard? | Daniel Golden Read more Just going to leave this here on news that president-elect Donald Trump may settle the multi-state class-action fraud lawsuit against his now-defunct Trump University business:Donald J.

Women and advocacy groups are preparing for the most serious assault on reproductive rights in decades after Hillary Clinton, the first female nominee of a major party, lost the presidential election to Donald Trump.  Protesters form a wall of women outside Trump Tower. Photograph: Erik M/ Pacific/ Barcroft ImagesTrump’s election, in tandem with an undivided Congress under Republican control, 33 GOP governors and an open seat on the supreme court with the possibility of more appointments, has cast serious uncertainty about the future of abortion in the US, advocates say.“It’s really bad – bad as we’ve ever seen it,” said Donna Crane, the vice-president of policy for Naral, a pro-choice advocacy group.Like many of his policy views, Trump’s stance on women’s reproductive rights has shifted throughout his campaign, including three contradictory positions on abortion in three hours. In an interview on Sunday with CBS’s 60 Minutes, Trump reiterated his vow to appoint conservative and pro-life supreme court justices, which could gradually restrict abortion access and even lead to overturning Roe v Wade, the 43-year-old ruling that legalized abortion in the US. (Trump, who appears to have an incongruous understanding of how the supreme court operates, had previously suggested this would happen “automatically”.)The prospect of overturning Roe v Wade has set off alarm bells among women’s health advocates, who are already fighting to hold the line against an avalanche of regulations meant to restrict access to abortions at the state level. But experts saying dismantling the precedent would be much more difficult than Trump seems to think it will be.“Roe has withstood the test of time, over 40 years,” said Kelly Baden, interim senior director of US policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, noting that US supreme court justices take precedents seriously even when they disagree with them. “It has survived anti-choice administrations, including ones that have pushed to appoint anti-choice justices to the supreme court.”In the interview, Trump said that if Roe v Wade is overturned, then women would “have to go to another state”. Asked if that was acceptable, he replied: “Well, we’ll see what happens. It’s got a long way to go.”Women’s rights groups brace for Trump: ‘We are used to fighting impossible odds’ Read more Video: Retired lieutenant general Michael Flynn, who was tapped this morning as president-elect Donald Trump’s national security advisor, calling Islam “like cancer”:Full quotation: Islam is a political ideology.

Enjoy!November 18, 2016 From a written statement submitted to Congress in 1986 by Thomas Figures, a former assistant United States Attorney, about Jeff Sessions, then a nominee for a federal district judgeship: Mr. Sessions called me into his office and indicated he felt I had been unduly harsh with the secretary. Mr. Sessions admonished me to ‘be careful what you say to white folks.’Had Mr. Sessions merely urged me to be careful about what I said to ‘folks,’ that admonition would have been quite reasonable. But that was not the language that he used.There was a period in our own lifetimes when blacks were regularly admonished to be particularly polite or deferential, and a remark of that sort may just have slipped out inadvertently. Ron Wyden is taking Donald Trump at his word.  Sen. Ron Wyden. Photograph: Steve Dykes/APMuch of official Washington is wondering whether Trump will implement the agenda that won him the presidency. Some of Trump’s defenders, like tech investor Peter Thiel, contend that Trump should not be taken literally.But the Democratic senator from Oregon shows no signs of interest in that discussion. As perhaps the Democratic party’s premier civil libertarian on Capitol Hill, his anticipation of the Trump administration starts from the perspective that the president-elect will govern as he campaigned: against Muslims, against immigrants, for torture, for surveillance. Wyden, from his perch on the intelligence committee, is preparing for a four-year battle.“We’re going to have to make sure now that a political agenda doesn’t replace a set of constitutional priorities. That’s the heart of it,” Wyden said in an interview with the Guardian this week.Wyden is one of the few national politicians who can plausibly claim to have fought national security abuses and championed civil liberties with equal vigor in the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations. He is far more comfortable discussing policies or proposals than he is discussing personalities, opting to refer to Trump simply as the president-elect.“You look at some of what the president-elect has to say and it certainly ought to be a wake-up call from the standpoint of potential abuse of power,” Wyden said.A quote sticking in Wyden’s mind these days is one Trump issued in July after the Democratic National Committee hack, which US intelligence has blamed on Russia. Trump, discussing his political opponents, mused: “Honestly, I wish I had that power. I’d love to have that power.” By 20 January, it will no longer be hypothetical.Ron Wyden on Trump's agenda: 'a wake-up call for potential abuse of power' Read more The feisty online campaign to persuade shoppers to boycott Ivanka Trump’s fashion products and the retailers that stock them, #GrabYourWallet, appears to be biting.

'You can do anything': Trump brags on tape about using fame to get women Read moreShe revealed in a Guardian exclusive at the time that his appalling boasting on tape reminded her of being sexually harassed by her boss at a Silicon Valley job in her youth.Coulter was outraged by the Donald but also by Ivanka’s vigorous support of her father’s presidential campaign with barely a “tisk”, while at the same time promoting her fashion and accessories line with messages of empowerment for the independent-minded, stylish working woman.“I’m elated,” Coulter told the Guardian on Thursday night about Shoes.com and Bellacor’s decisions.The retailers didn’t cite #GrabYourWallet specifically but coincidentally contacted supporters of the campaign who had complained to them to explain they were dropping the products.Coulter tweets about her campaign have been viewed more than nine million times and the #GrabYourWallet hashtag has been read or spread 200 million times in just over a month.She began by posting a list of retailers that sell items from the Ivanka Trump Collection, including the big hitters at the mall, Macy’s, Nordstrom, Nieman Marcus and Lord & Taylor, and high profile online names such as Amazon and Zappos, urging consumers not only to boycott them but to contact them to protest.With the traditional post-Thanksgiving retail-binge imminent, none of the big guys have budged – yet.“I have plenty of indications that the larger players are paying very close attention to this. I’m not surprised that the smaller players would be the first to drop the products, however. And I know the message is getting through,” said Coulter.She hopes that even if big retailers don’t want to appear partisan, now that Trump is president-elect and his family members are poised to benefit “big league”, that they will feel an unpleasant “conflict of interest” in stocking Trump products, she said.#GrabYourWallet has sparked a backlash from some Trump voters who are now keen to encourage boycotts of the retailers that boycott Trump.Steph (@steph93065).@shoesdotcom is NOT interested in the business of 60 Million Americans and are engaging in corporate terrorism against Ivanka. pic.twitter.com/K9DmiWNKiKNovember 17, 2016Meanwhile Coulter is already blue sky thinking about whether #GrabYourWallet could grow into a bigger phenomenon as a shopping ethics monitor that rates companies by their respect for women and inclusiveness in general.“It could be measuring how many women or people of color they have in senior executive leadership, the ethical dimensions of the products they carry. We want to support companies that take the high road,” she said.

He is a staunch opponent of legal immigration and someone who has blocked every effort to improve, modernize, and humanize our immigration system, which is two or three decades out-of-date.He ran for the Senate because he was deemed by the Senate Judiciary Committee as too racist to serve as a federal judge. He is the kind of person who will set back law enforcement, civil rights, the courts, and increase America’s mass incarceration industry and erase 50 years of progress.
NOM NOM NOMOh, José. You just couldn’t resist, could you? To be fair, we’ve all been there. There is, for example, a feeling that most adults in the developed world must by now have experienced which occurs when, shortly before their anticipated bedtime, they find themselves idly flicking through their available TV channels, notice that The Shawshank Redemption has just started on ITV Lifestyle Men & Motors 38, decide that they might just watch 10 minutes or so, and the next thing they know it’s 2.30am and they’re watching Andy Dufresne polish a boat. There are some temptations which we are not culturally or genetically capable of resisting, and this is one. You might have others that are particular to you, things you don’t so much choose to do as are unable to not do: the cracking of one’s knuckles, the casual digital exploration of the nasal cavity, the repeated and unnecessary insulting of one’s contemporaries, that kind of thing.José Mourinho is only human, a bundle of cells and synapses that react to certain stimuli in predictable ways. In his case, very predicable ways. And the thing that really gets him going, without exception triggering massive and uncontrollable aggressive chuntering, is imminent encounters with Arsène Wenger.Prior to tomorrow’s meeting between Mourinho’s Manchester United and Wenger’s Arsenal, the Portuguese man o’hate has let rip once again. “The record against any other manager being good or bad is not important to me,” he fibbed. “The only thing that matters is what you get as a team. And in the Premier League tomorrow is a match between the two managers with the best record in the Premier League. Between the two managers we are speaking about I think [he knows] six or seven [six] Premier League titles, I’m not sure [he is sure]. I have three I think [he knows] and Mr Wenger has three [see, he knew]. Does that mean we should be respective even in periods when our results are not the best? I think Mr Wenger has that respect from all of you. I don’t think I have. My last Premier League title was 18 months ago not 18 years ago [Wenger’s is only 12 and a half years back, to be fair]. I don’t think I get that respect. But to be honest, I just follow my way.”This must all be very upsetting for poor Arsène, who, before Mourinho came along, was the undisputed No1 continental-born manager in Premier League history. Mourinho took that title from him and replaced it with another, describing him in 2014 as “a specialist in failure”. Then Mourinho proved how able and successful he was by taking that title off the hapless Frenchman too, achieving failure on a scale Wenger has never approached or even imagined.And now Mourinho stands alone as the most failure-stained, success-laden dugout-occupant in the land, a ball of exaggerated pride and inexplicable fury, a man who believes managers who have been successful deserve respect while simultaneously refusing to respect managers who have been successful, a man who is endlessly irritated by the swagger of a once-successful man whose results no longer match his reputation, but can’t for the life of him understand why anyone might have any kind of problem with himself.Still, it all sets up tomorrow’s game rather nicely. Sure, it’s likely to end in an irksome and ill-tempered post-match interview with either this manager or the other one, but then that’s part of why we love it so. And if it’s a happy ending you’re after, the Fiver can always suggest a decent movie.

It was a touchstone of the Hillary Clinton campaign to paint Donald Trump as an alarming figure who was far from a positive role model for children. One campaign ad, called “role models”, which was viewed more than a million times on youtube, featured young children watching some of Trump’s most controversial and profane comments - including calling Mexican immigrants rapists and mocking a reporter with disabilities - with impressionable expressions. In the wake of Trump’s victory, parents have tried to turn a divisive and bitter election into a learning curve – by getting their children to write positive letters to the president-elect and mailing them to Trump Tower. A Facebook group called “Dear President Trump: Letters from Kids About Kindness” was set up the day after the election by Molly Spence Sahebjami. Sahebjami’s idea was for children to write letters to Trump “about the importance of being kind to other people, even if they’re different than you are”. The mother, a resident of Seattle, where voters overwhelmingly supported Clinton, said she knew many others who disapproved of Trump’s caustic language in the course of the campaign. She told the Washington Post that she decided to set up the group after her son, who goes to kindergarten, expressed concern about things Trump had said about Muslims because the family were of Iranian descent.“[Children] don’t know anything about the issues, like manufacturing jobs,” Sahebjami said. “But they know – at least where I live, it’s really prevalent [for kids] to say, ‘Oh, he’s the mean one’.” She added: “So I said to [my son], ‘Well maybe we should write a letter to him and we can show him. Why don’t you talk to him about why it’s important to be kind?’” Her son’s letter read: “Dear President-elect Trump, please be a good president. Be kind to all people. Some people in my family are a special religion and they are not bad guys.” While the Facebook group is closed to prevent negative comments, members can add other members, and more than 10,000 people have now joined. They have been encouraged to take pictures of their children’s letters and share them on social media using the hashtag #kidsletterstotrump.“DEAR MR TRUMP Be kind please FROM A Littel Boy TOMMY,” read one letter.Another, from a 13-year-old girl, stated: “Dear Donald Trump. Congratulations! To be honest you were not my first pick. I just wanted to tell you that I didn’t like the way you campaigned. You made women (including myself) feel bad, you discouraged people who weren’t like you. However, I am going to put those feelings aside and I hope that you will prove me wrong.”Lara (@larahollingswor)#kidsletterstotrump 13 yrs old and gracious beyond her years.

So, this afternoon we went out on the street just outside our theatre to ask children to give us their thoughts on our next president,” Kimmel said.

'The American epic': Hollywood's enduring love for the western Read moreIn the extended title sequence of Sergio Leone’s epic 1968 western Once Upon a Time in the West, three vengeful-looking gunslingers await the arrival of the next train at the remote Cattle Corner Station. Not a word is shared between them. Instead, caught in vivid closeup like the lines ingrained on the weathered skin of their faces, it’s the sounds that tell a story: chalk screeches across a blackboard; water drips on to the brim of a hat and, in the dead stillness of the desert outside, a windpump gently squeaks. Even before knuckles are cracked, pistols are cocked and the man they’ve been waiting to kill announces his arrival with three mournful notes on a harmonica, it’s clear that things are about to turn ugly.This month, that haunting harmonica is back, as Ennio Morricone celebrates 60 years in music with a concert tour of his film scores and a new album of his best-known themes. Yet like so much of Morricone’s music, the melancholic motif – whether inhabiting the dreamy soundscapes of the Orb’s “Little Fluffy Clouds” or Bruce Springsteen’s cowboy epic “Outlaw Pete” – now breathes with a life of its own. “It’s very gratifying that people are enjoying my music even though they don’t see it accompanied by scenes on film,” says Morricone, when we meet at his apartment in Rome. “Usually nobody thinks about the film composer – a movie could be silent; it could have music or not – whereas in concerts it’s different because the audience is there to listen to my music alone.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   After the Dollars … Once Upon a Time in the West. Photograph: Sportsphoto Ltd/AllstarHaving just turned 88, and with around 500 soundtracks to his name, Morricone is one of cinema’s most prolific and stylistically diverse composers. On tour, as on disc, he conducts the baroque-styled choruses and lyrical oboe theme of The Mission alongside the paired down coyote-inspired howls of The Good, The Bad and the Ugly and the tenderly sentimental piano and string motifs of “Nuovo”, written for Giuseppe Tornatore’s Cinema Paradiso. The disc also includes themes for Quentin Tarantino’s high-tension western The Hateful Eight, which won Morricone an Academy award earlier this year. It was his first for an original score following five previous nominations, but he laughs when I suggest he take his tour to the US. “I don’t feel like flying and going all the way to America,” he says. “I didn’t even want to go and pick up the Oscar. The producer and the director asked me to please go.” He had to cancel three concerts earlier this year due to back problems, but throws open his arms in a broad show of generosity. “OK, I would go to America if they pay me loads of money.”It’s from Rome that Morricone has made his name as one of Hollywood’s top-earning score writers, and it was here that he found his feet as a composer. He grew up in the Trastevere district, and began composing at the age of six, copying down works, such as Weber’s Der Freischütz overture, that he’d heard on the radio. His father, an accomplished trumpeter, supported the family by performing in local jazz clubs and on film soundtracks, and Ennio would dutifully follow in his footsteps: at the age of 10, he entered the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia to study trumpet, later also studying composition. At night he would play the clubs as a jazz trumpeter, stepping in for his father when he was ill.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Listen to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly themeThose war years were decisive for Morricone, as he discovered how light music could bring happiness during bleak times. In the late 1950s and early 60s he arranged hundreds of songs, and it was the whipcracks, bells and galloping rhythms of his arrangement of California-born folk singer Peter Tevis’s hit single “Pastures of Plenty” that impressed his former elementary-school classmate Leone when they reunited to discuss their first film together, A Fistful of Dollars. What happens to my concert works? I produce and pay for the CDs that nobody will buyMorricone prefers not to talk about his Leone projects, and has often pointed out that during the heyday of his western-scoring, between 1963 and 1980, a mere 35 of his 300 films were about cowboys. But it was their collaborations, and in particular the Dollars trilogy – A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – that established his reputation and allowed him to pursue other projects. Rather than writing music to fit Leone’s footage, Morricone would start composing before filming began, with the director using the music on set to get his characters into the mood of the film. His scores build in three stages, from earthy percussion and humble folkish instruments – such as harmonica, panpipes or the Jew’s harp and whistles of For a Few Dollars More – to rock-influenced electronic guitars to orchestrations, featuring trumpets for the final showdowns, and expansive strings and chorus that perfectly match the epic journeys and widescreen compositions of Leone’s films. Instrumental colour is key. Conveying a distinct sense of character and place, these ramped-up themes deliver us into the world of the Old American West, where Clint Eastwood’s “Man with No Name” – a man so quick on the draw he’ll put his order in with the local coffin maker on his way into town, and add to it, after the shootout, on his way out – loom both heroically and absurdly larger than life. But the reason his tunes have lasted so well, says Morricone, is that the musical ideas are complete in themselves: “I learned by observing the use of Mozart and Bach and Mahler in movies. I said, ‘This is solid, it has integrity; I want to do something similar.’ That is why I started writing my music before the film was shot.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Kurt Russell and Samuel L Jackson in The Hateful Eight (2015), which marked Morricone’s return to the western genre. Photograph: Allstar/the Weinstein CompanyThe opening 13 minutes of Once Upon a Time are a playful reminder of how Morricone was grounded in experimental music, in particular the philosophy of John Cage. A member of the avant-garde ensemble Nuova Consonanza, Morricone was a firm advocate of challenging the boundaries between noise and music, and of the tone-row techniques of the Second Viennese School – his early compositions are atonal and complex. In all, he has written more than 100 concert works, often taking time out of his film schedule to focus on what he calls “the highest ideals of composition”; but still, he says, only 5% of his output is music that he aspires to write. “I’m not turning my back on film music; I’m not saying that I reject it,” he explains. “What I mean is that 95% of my music was written for the public at large, because a movie has to be understood by ordinary people who don’t necessarily understand complex music.” The 5% that does meet his ideals, he says, is “difficult music that I’ve experimented with, that I was really into but that I was strongly advised to leave behind. I had to leave it because it was too difficult. That doesn’t mean that 95% of my music is inane or trivial … it’s music catering to simple needs.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Watch the opening scene of Inglorious Basterds, featuring Morricone’s reimagining of BeethovenIt’s easy to imagine that cocooned in the silky strings of his early 80s charts hit Chi Mai is a classical composer just wriggling to get out. On film, he will often pay homage to classical repertoire, reinterpreting themes with a Stravinsky-like ease – augmenting Beethoven’s Für Elise melody in The Big Gundown, for example, to create the suspenseful motif that Tarantino would borrow for the opening scene of Inglorious Basterds. But Morricone’s relationship with the classical music tradition goes much deeper than style. When asked whether he arranges his works for concert performance, he says that his choice of instruments is integral to the themes he writes, so they are the same live as when you hear them on film: “When Beethoven wrote a symphony, that was that,” he says. “He didn’t adapt it to the theatre in which it was performed. If it was not appropriate, then he wouldn’t perform it there.”As with Bernard Herrmann, who had aspirations to be taken seriously in the concert hall but would be forever thought of as Alfred Hitchcock’s composer, Morricone has formed close long-term relationships with directors who respect his vision. He has scored all of Tornatore’s films over the last three decades – including his forthcoming Jeremy Irons and Olga Kurylenko romance, Correspondence – and enjoyed a long and fruitful collaboration with Pier Paolo Pasolini, who showed him the power of using classical works on screen. Meanwhile, Morricone’s darker atonal sounds have found a natural home in the horror films of Dario Argento, and his more complex ideas continue to resurface – most recently his music for John Carpenter’s 1982 The Thing re-emerged in Tarantino’s Hateful Eight. “I haven’t had a problem with working in a risk-averse industry,” he says. “I always felt free and obviously directors call me because they hold me in the highest esteem.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Sentimental strings in Cinema Paradiso (1988). Photograph: Allstar/MIRAMAX/Sportsphoto Ltd./AllstarPerhaps that’s why, six decades on, Morricone seems to harbour none of the resentments or frustrations that his early ambitions to become an avant-garde composer might have left him with. Yes, he has made decisions he regrets, such as turning down Eastwood’s initial requests to work with him when the actor turned his hand to directing; and of the 500 films not all could be great (Michael Anderson’s post-Jaws film Orca, for example, always seemed destined to sink). But he has reached out to more listeners than most. When asked whether he would rather his new disc had been of his concert hall works, instead of music catering to “simple needs”, he laughs and excuses himself from the room. “I’ll give you one CD of mine,” he says, returning with a recording of his works written for children’s choir. “I produce and pay for the CDs that nobody will buy.” One day, he hopes, we’ll begin mining that 5%.• Morricone 60 is released on Decca Records.

I grew up in central Los Angeles. My father was born in Russia. He was a survivor. He had come to the US in 1915, when he was 16, not speaking a word of English, on his own, at the insistence of his family. He landed in Ellis Island and made a life for himself. My mother was from the Lower East Side of New York. She was a secretary, she was good with numbers and played the violin, but not professionally.One of my earliest memories is from when I was eight. In school, in a music appreciation class, there was a table filled with instruments and I happened to pick up a trumpet. It had a profound effect on my life. At home, I’d be playing it, and the neighbours would yell, “Shut the window!” while my mother yelled back at them. My brother played drums; we were a musical family. My father could play the mandolin, although he didn’t read music.As my father’s fortunes improved, he brought the rest of his family from Russia to live near us. My grandfather stayed there. I remember my paternal grandmother, but she only spoke Yiddish so communication was an issue. My mother wasn’t close to her own parents so we didn’t see much of them. I had an elder brother, David, who was five years my senior. We used to play outside or in the street, but I was super-shy and followed him around, but he wasn’t so interested in hanging out with me.I guess we were middle class. My dad earned a reasonable living manufacturing women’s suits and clothing as a business; we didn’t struggle and had a vacation now and then.I didn’t have a strong idea about what career I wanted. I knew I liked playing the trumpet. My brother and I played together at parties and events. At high school, I was in a little group, with piano, bass, drums and trumpet. We entered a TV talent contest that pitted groups from local high schools against each other. Even though few people had TV sets in the 1950s, we won the show for eight consecutive weeks and that made us a name, so we got gigs around the city on the back of that.I got married when I was 21. At the time, I’d been drafted and was playing with the Sixth Army band in San Francisco’s Presidio. I was also working part-time in a gym, and tried my hand at acting for a while, but that didn’t work out. I was too young to get married, as evidenced by my getting divorced. I probably didn’t understand what was expected of me at that age. Then I got famous and started touring the world, so I wasn’t around much.When I got married the second time, I felt very lucky. Lani is my dream girl. We have been married for 42 years now and had a child together.I’m not sure what my parents taught me. My father didn’t articulate much, but led by example. He was generous to his family and very open-hearted. If someone needed his help, he was always right there for them, and I saw how people responded to his generosity.I’m now a grandfather a few times over. My youngest is two-and-a-half years old. I love the experience and we see family as much as we can. They are scattered across the state, but we have Skype so that helps us stay connected.Family is the part of my life that gives me comfort. I am very aware of, and sensitive to, my family’s needs and I’ll always be there for them, but family is not something I totally live for. You get one chance to do your thing in this life and I am doing my thing. My creativity drives me – I don’t have any control over it. I know I have made a lot of people happy with my music, and that gives me an enormous energy and pleasure.• Herb Alpert’s new album, Human Nature, is out now, along with 24 of his albums remastered: herbalpert.comTopicsFamilyMy family valuesinterviewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Identifying the best batsman in the world is a parlous exercise. Once upon a time you may have said Tendulkar, but I’d think Ponting. How about Kallis? Then what about Lara? Does Kohli top the pops now? Not if you’ve got Root. Or maybe Williamson. And that Smith bloke goes alright.It’s not so hard in the women’s game. The finest on the planet is Australia’s captain Meg Lanning. Nobody disputes her dominance. Except maybe herself. “I don’t see myself as the best player in the world,” she tells Guardian Australia ahead of Australia’s opening match of the summer in Canberra on Friday. “I don’t have the complete game in any way; that’s how I keep my motivation up.”Despite the humble sentiment, at 24 years old Lanning’s primacy can be readily demonstrated through the force of her blistering drives or the precision of her cut shots. But the empirical case trumps all that, even. To pick the obvious stat from the format her Southern Stars are playing five fixtures against the touring South Africans, Lanning has eight one-day international centuries in just 49 innings. That’s one behind the most on record, by recently retired England great Charlotte Edwards, but coming in just over a quarter of the matches.Solve Australia's cricket crisis: pick your own Adelaide Test team and coach Read moreOnly Hashim Amla sports a better innings-to-hundred strike rate for any limited overs player. Tallying scores 50 and above, Lanning gets to raise her bat one in every three times to the crease – marginally superior to Sachin Tendulkar. In the shortest form the numerical evidence is less pronounced, but she still boasts the highest score made in a T20 women’s international (126), and has been gonged as the ICC’s player of the year in both white ball categories. Wisden assessed likewise in 2015, with Lanning their leading woman in world cricket. So, with the greatest respect to our subject’s opinion, the jury is otherwise in. For a snapshot of Lanning so far this summer in October, for Victoria she smacked 190 against Tasmania – the highest score ever in the national competition. Sure enough, it was her own record that was bettered. A fortnight later she walloped a new club cricket best in Victoria, an unbeaten 241. In summary, she enters this bilateral series in especially red hot form. But there’s a healthy understanding with Lanning that despite her own mastery the exceptional growth in women’s cricket is a challenge to her side’s own authority. Where success was once the exclusive domain of the Australia, England and occasionally New Zealand, the West Indies knocked off Lanning’s charges in the World T20 Final in March, shocking the thrice-consecutive champs. With a series of players battle hardened on the international stage South Africa shouldn’t be far from the mark while in the country, and certainly not overwhelmed. However, losing the fastest bowler in women’s cricket, Shabnil Ismail, due to a disciplinary ruling – and ‘keeper Trisha Chetty for the same indiscretions – the tourists aren’t at full strength. What they have lost in personnel they will need to recover through incentive. With the ICC’s new world rankings scheme securing the top four teams an automatic berth to next year’s ODI World Cup in England, if the sixth-ranked tourists can thrash the hosts they’re likely straight in. Lanning’s assessment ahead of the series – moving from Canberra to Sydney to Coffs Harbour – is that their opponents are underrated by their spot on the table. “We’ve seen a number of their them out here last year in the WBBL. They’ve got some really dangerous players.”For her own team’s part, Lanning agrees this doubles as the beginning of their journey to England. Already occupying poll position in World Cup seedings, they have come off a comprehensive away thrashing of Sri Lanka during the winter. But going back-to-back in that tournament will require at some stage overcoming a remodelled England outfit and a New Zealand squad full of talented veterans desperate for a trophy. Not to mention the West Indies riding high after their own success, and India, who flummoxed Australia in a T20 series at home last summer. “It is important that we get our 50-over game plan really down pat,” notes Lanning of the mission ahead between now and next July.Greater awareness of overseas threats is explained by the women’s cricket world getting smaller as it gets bigger. Over the last year in addition to the WBBL a comparable domestic competition – a six team T20 ‘super league’ – has emerged in England. The two tournaments have created what amounts to a quasi-professional circuit, showcasing elite women from across the cricket world. Much like the men, it means the best play the best far more now than they ever have before. At home, the WBBL’s footprint is slated to grow in the afterglow of season one, no better evidenced by Channel Ten’s main station investing in the broadcast of 12 live games, including four fixtures on the 10-11 December opening weekend. “There’s no doubt the WBBL is going to be really exciting” says Lanning, and after missing the inaugural UK hit out due to a shoulder injury, she now sees herself crossing back and forth between the two leagues for the medium term. “It is more and more a year-round thing now. We want to play more cricket so it is great that there are more opportunities to play. That’s a great thing about women’s cricket, it is really moving forward.”It is also moving fast in terms of pay. Lanning until recently publicly declared herself a “semi-professional,” by contrast to her England competitors who have since 2014 had full-time contracts. But now, owing to Cricket Australia this year expanding their payment pool, Southern Stars players can now earn up to $65,000 per year, alongside additional remuneration for the WBBL and marketing bonuses. The result: “I probably consider myself to be professional,” Lanning says, adding that while she doesn’t think that is yet the case for all of her colleagues, it isn’t far off either. “We’re in a very good spot right now.”With Australia’s men in the midst of what has the potential to be their worst summer in current memory, this creates a new opportunity for Lanning’s side nurture new affection and attention and eyeballs. And she knows it. “Australia loves teams that win,” says Lanning. They sure do. And it helps when they’re led by out by best.TopicsCricketSouthern StarsAustralia sportWomen's cricketfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
When the R&B singer Dawn Richard abandoned the safety of the major-label machine to strike out on her own in 2011, she was gambling. All she’d managed to release under her own name was one promising but flawed mixtape. So her announcement that she intended to start her solo career with a concept trilogy of albums – despite lacking a team around her, let alone a record deal – was seen as overly ambitious. “Everyone laughed at me,” she recalls wryly.In 2011, Richard was just another girl group refugee who talked a good game – Danity Kane, formed by Diddy on MTV’s Making the Band in 2005, had scored two US No 1 albums before disbanding three years later. Since reinventing herself as D∆WN in 2015, she’s found acclaim in the underground dance world. But her true triumph is the visionary body of work she’s put together, vast in sonic, thematic and technological scope, that – having taken in medieval warfare, Norse and Greek mythology and feminist reimaginings of classic pop archetypes – has now culminated with the final instalment of the promised trilogy, the appropriately titled Redemption.“It’s built to be jubilation and dance,” says Richard. “I wanted to make an album that sounded like a release of inhibitions, really getting away from the idea that you have to be anything other than in that moment.” Richard’s sound is defined equally by the number of ideas she packs into her songs and the shape-shifting, boundary-free nature of where she takes them: house beats segue into Afro-Cuban drums on Love Under Lights; lead single Renegades is propelled by staccato grime rhythms; centrepiece LA transitions from synths straight out of an 80s thriller into swampy rock before winding up with a trumpet solo from New Orleans jazz musician Trombone Shorty.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest That song – its title refers to both Los Angeles and Louisiana – is a homecoming for Richard, whose family was made homeless following Hurricane Katrina. While writing Redemption, she immersed herself in her home city’s musical history: “old zydeco, old bayou blues like Dr John”, the carnival culture of the Mardi Gras Indians (for whom her great-uncle was a costumier) and New Orleans’ second line tradition. “It’s when we dance in the middle of the street and play the horns,” she says. “People just sing in sheer joy. They celebrate each other with such genuine love.”  Most people think Grace Jones and David Bowie are on a different plane. Dawn – humbly – sees them as in reachWhile delving into the past, Richard also felt herself pulled towards the future. Redemption’s predecessor, 2015’s Blackheart, had been the album that catapulted her from lone-wolf status into the arms of the underground. Close collaborations followed with Fade to Mind co-founder Kingdom (with whom she released the Infrared EP in May) and, for much of Redemption, the North Carolina producer Machinedrum. Redemption will also be the first of Richard’s albums to be jointly released with another label, the London-based grime and garage imprint Local Action. When its founder Tom Lea talks about her, it’s with a degree of awe: “Most people look at artists like Grace Jones and David Bowie and see them on a different plane, but Dawn – humbly – sees them as in reach.” She’s also making forays into experimental new technology: working with YouTube on the platform’s first ever 360-degree live performance in April, and creating a 3D virtual reality universe with VR Playhouse for her Not Above That video in June. “The point of me doing the type of music I was doing was to see it in 3D, 4D, VR perspective,” she says. “As you peel back the different layers of coding in VR, you can also peel the layers of plug-ins and live instruments back on the album. That was where I wanted to go.”Richard had always planned for her trilogy’s narrative arc to conclude with a return to her roots, but the journey itself has been unpredictable, often painful and sometimes absurd.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Following 2013’s Goldenheart, Richard fell out with producer Druski, the musical partner with whom she’d intended to make the entire trilogy; a Kickstarter to fund Blackheart failed; and a year was given over to a doomed Danity Kane reunion that redefined girl group messiness. (It ended with punches thrown before even making it to an album release.) “That’s a good fuckin’ question,” laughs Richard darkly when asked why she had returned to the band. In the same year, her father had cancer and her grandmother died. “Man, it was a super-low,” she says. “It was crazy how low it was. But it made for some of the best material [Blackheart] I’ve done.”The lessons Richard has learned haven’t just been emotional. As an independent artist, she’s relished the freedom of self-releasing the kind of music she wants. Self-funding it hasn’t been so easy, particularly when she faced so many rejections. “We’re having ideas that are so much larger than our pockets,” she says. “We’re doing nine visuals per album, and we’re held to the standard of any other artist. You have to work twice as hard, otherwise people say, ‘That looks cheap.’ Or, ‘She’s a flop.’ And you’ve got to create content every other day to keep people interested in a time when everything’s accessible and moving so fast.”  My plan didn’t sell to the machines of the world, but it sold to the artists, the passion playersRichard, who compares herself to a tech startup company, began studying accounting, investment and money management, and picked up an old animation sideline (Danity Kane had been named after an anime character she’d invented) for extra funds. She carried on knocking at doors, fleshing out her brand. “I wasn’t saying, ‘Look, here’s me as an artist and I can sing, can you support me?’” she says. “I was laying out an entire, full-drawn economic plan and saying, ‘Look, this is what we can attain.’ It didn’t sell to the mainstream or the machines of the world, but it sold to the artists, the passion players.”She has had to be her own PR firm, her own agency, even her own stagehand. When she realised this year that she couldn’t afford to tour with her band and dancers as well as the 9ft neon triangle that formed her stage set, she took on that latter role. “I realised the way I can save costs is to build it and fix it and carry it myself. I brought along my screwdrivers and I set it up and took it down for each show myself. It’s hollow steel rods and a lightbox that carries the LED – two big cases I carried everywhere I went.” It paid off: Richard points to her SXSW shows in March as a turning point after which doors began to open for her. “I had backaches every day, but I managed to give people a stadium-style show in dive bars – a show that was talked about for an indie girl with no label. It was fucking worth it.” One year, on her birthday, Richard went skydiving. Now, she compares that adrenaline rush to what she’s felt over the past few years. “Anything that creates fear, I want to conquer it,” she says. “To create and do something no one else has done before – that feeling beats anything else I’ve felt.” • Redemption is out now on Local Action/Our Dawn Entertainment.TopicsR&B;Dance musicPop and rockinterviewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Very few outside Venezuela seem to have the courage to describe it as such, but the country under Nicolás Maduro is now a dictatorship. The heir of Hugo Chávez has shown that he will happily violate all principles of democracy and human rights to remain in power. For years, Chávez proudly reminded the world how many elections he had won, and how his revolution was giving a voice to the impoverished masses. Today, Maduro has no interest in anybody else’s voice – especially the growing majority that opposes him.The presidential recall referendum, which could have led to early elections if it had been held this year, was killed off by regional courts that had no say in electoral matters. The elections for governors and mayors, which would have been a major defeat for the “Chavistas”, were arbitrarily postponed by the government-controlled Electoral Council. And the National Assembly, in which the opposition holds a two-thirds majority, continues to be obstructed by a supreme court also controlled by Maduro. Opposition leaders continue to be imprisoned on trumped-up chargesAnd then there is the matter of the political prisoners. The most emblematic case is opposition leader Leopoldo López, who was jailed for 13 years for “inciting violence” during the 2014 protests, in which police, military and government militias killed unarmed protesters. Months later, Lopez’s prosecutor, Franklin Nieves, fled the country and admitted that the trial had been a sham. That, however, changed nothing.Why do people seem to find it so difficult to call things by their proper name when it comes to Venezuela? For years, many in the opposition cried wolf, denouncing the government as a dictatorship. It is hard to believe that they have been proved – eventually – right. Chávez won his first election in 1998 with 3.6 million votes. In 2006 he was re-elected with 7.3 million votes. To many in the opposition it was unbelievable that so many people could support him. Rather than accept that there was a huge mass of Venezuelans who had been marginalised for decades, they accused the president of fraud and labelled him a dictator.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Students demonstrate against the Nicolás Maduro government on the streets of Caracas. Photograph: Ronaldo Schemidt/AFP/Getty ImagesChávez was an authoritarian; there is no doubt about that. That is why he, a former coup leader, was elected in the first place. In the late 1990s the middle class (and even some of the rich) were longing for “a strongman with well-strapped boots” that could bring order to the country. So Chávez gladly took the reins, but he was generally careful about crossing the line between democracy and dictatorship. Even as he shut down the RCTV television network and 34 radio stations, he managed to do it under a guise of legality. His party ruled supreme in the National Assembly, yes, but only because the opposition had withdrawn from the elections.Now that Maduro has demolished what was left of Chávez’s democratic façade, many outside Venezuela are left wondering who to believe. But some things are undeniable. Maduro and his allies are blocking elections. Opposition leaders continue to be imprisoned on trumped-up charges. And as much as his supporters would like to blame the shortages of food and medicines, the failure of the electric grid and other services, the madness of an inflation above 700% and the cannibalisation of Venezuela’s oil industry on an imaginary “economic war” waged by an evil empire, the truth is that all of this is a result of the policies of Maduro (and Chávez).Venezuelan president is to blame for humanitarian crisis, OAS chief says Read moreAll peaceful and democratic paths seem closed now. A dialogue mediated by the Vatican has only managed to split the opposition in half: on one side are those who don’t believe that the government is capable of sincere dialogue and the talks are just a public relations stunt; on the other, those who know that most dialogues in the history of conflict resolution happened under similar circumstances. More importantly, they understand that no amount of street protests – or even a popular revolt – will pressure Maduro into resigning. Some of them are so pessimistic that they are now looking to the presidential elections of 2018 as a way out. Do they honestly think that by then the government will be willing to respect democracy?Meanwhile there is very little that the international community can do to help. But it would be refreshing to see the British ask questions to those that are doing business with a dictatorship. Why has BP been selling oil to Venezuela? Why is British public relations firm Bell Pottinger, according to Bloomberg, whitewashing the reputation of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA? Why is Unite, the largest trade union in Britain, hosting PR events in London in support of Maduro? Do they all know they are taking money from a dictatorship? Do they care? And what about Jeremy Corbyn and all those politicians that have spoken out and signed letters in support of Maduro? We would love to hear what they have to say about all this.TopicsVenezuelaOpinionAmericasNicolás MadurocommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
World leaders will closely watch Shinzo Abe’s meeting with Donald Trump in New York on Thursday for tips on how to handle the unpredictable US president-elect.How Trump responds to Abe – the first head of government to gain an audience with him – will be of equal interest, given the importance Japan attaches to respectful behaviour and correct protocol. Japan’s prime minister pulled off this coup when he rang up to congratulate Trump after last week’s election, suggesting he drop by on his way to a regional summit in Peru. By getting in first, Abe has trumped other traditional allies, such as Britain’s Theresa May. Already stereotyped as a second Margaret Thatcher to Trump’s Ronald Reagan, May is still waiting for a chance to meet the president-elect. Manliness matters a lot, apparently, to a politician frequently labelled a misogynist. So Abe’s hard-headed, conservative style may appeal to Trump. The Japanese PM has a record of hitting it off with “strongman” leaders of the type Trump seems to admire. To the annoyance of the Obama administration, he has pursued closer ties with Vladimir Putin, increasing Japanese investment in Russian energy projects while pushing to resolve old territorial disputes. Hillary Clinton: 'There have been times when I wanted never to leave the house again' Read moreAbe also reportedly gets on well with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s authoritarian president, and Iran’s leaders. He recently told the vociferously anti-American Philippines leader, Rodrigo Duterte, that he was a “famous figure”.“Abe has the mysterious skill of getting along with people,” Makoto Iokibe, the former president of the National Defense Academy of Japan, told Mainichi Shimbun newspaper. “If Abe can get along with Putin, perhaps he won’t find it difficult to strike up a cordial relationship with Trump.” Outright flattery is a tactic likely to work with Trump who, despite his bluster, has zero experience at this elevated level and will be feeling his way. If the two men get on well, Abe may draw on his superior knowledge to shape or temper Trump’s views, for example on future dealings with China, Tokyo’s more powerful regional rival. Abe is likely to appeal directly to common interests as a way of defusing or circumventing Trump’s more alarming statements. During the campaign he demanded Japan pay more for the upkeep of US bases. Trump also suggested, although this is now disputed, that Japan and South Korea consider acquiring nuclear weapons to deter Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s dictator, whom he termed a “maniac”. Japanese analysts calculate Tokyo is already paying up to 75% of the total cost of American military deployments in Japan, which include 50,000 troops and the US Seventh Fleet, and that these commitments uphold a shared interest in maintaining security across the east- and south-east Asian regions.Japanese PM Abe to meet Trump against backdrop of security fears Read moreLikewise, Abe may argue, North Korea’s rogue nuclear weapons programme represents a threat to the entire free world, of which Trump will soon be the nominal leader, and is undermining global counter-proliferation efforts. Such an approach would appeal to Trump’s idea of himself as a budding international statesman. A key test will be whether Abe can change Trump’s mind about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an ambitious international trade pact. Abe is a strong supporter and will hope to convince Trump of its virtues despite the latter’s oft-stated criticism of free trade treaties in general. It will be a meeting of contrasts. Physically, the two men are strikingly different. At 6ft 2in (1.87 metres), Trump is five inches taller and a lot heavier. This will presumably gratify any assumptions Trump may hold about senior and junior partners in the US-Japan alliance. Yet, in psychological terms, the disparity could work to Abe’s advantage. But Abe may have to bite his tongue. For such a distinguished visitor, he may experience an unusual degree of back-slapping informality and undiplomatic banter. Trump’s guest will also have to refrain from interpreting his transition team’s organisational confusion as deliberate rudeness. As Abe flew to New York, aides could still not say exactly where and when the meeting would take place. For all anybody knows, it could be in Trump’s favourite steak diner.TopicsShinzo AbeDonald TrumpJapanAsia PacificUS politicsanalysisShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Marcus Rashford’s big audition for José Mourinho’s Manchester United will come against Arsenal on Saturday if he is handed the No9 berth. Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s one-game suspension means a vacancy opens up at centre-forward in a major match for the first time since Mourinho took over and made the Swede his totem signing.It was against Arsenal that Rashford got his first Premier League goals last February, scoring twice after he had done the same on his debut against Midtjylland three days earlier, and he will hope to lay down another marker against Arsène Wenger’s side.Tired of internationals? You're in luck: the big leagues return in style this weekend Read moreIbrahimovic’s much-trumpeted arrival on a free transfer posed a question of Rashford: what would it mean for him following a stellar beginning to a career when the teenager was last season’s hot prospect and he was swept all the way to playing for England at Euro 2016?Rashford became a virtual fixture in the lone-striker role for Louis van Gaal’s United – a run that included starting May’s FA Cup final and ended with eight goals in 18 appearances. He also scored once – on debut – for England, yet when United travelled to Bournemouth on the season’s opening day the answer to the question was not what he hoped for.Ibrahimovic was at centre-forward, which was no great surprise, and Rashford was dropped, which did raise eyebrows. His mix of rawness, pace, dribbling prowess and finishing is unique in Mourinho’s squad but the manager could find no place for him in the XI, nor as a replacement.United beat Eddie Howe’s side 3-1 and the story remained the same when Southampton visited next: Ibrahimovic was up top, Rashford was on the bench, and United won 2-0, the Swede scoring both goals to follow one against Bournemouth.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Marcus Rashford celebrates after scoring Manchester United’s winner at Hull in August, one of four goals he has got this season. Photograph: Matt McNulty/JMP/Rex/ShutterstockRashford has the ability to break a contest open and make himself impossible to ignore. Just as the debut goals against Midtjylland in that Europa League match said to Van Gaal: “Just try to drop me,” so Rashford sent Mourinho a message in a first competitive appearance for him, at Hull City.United were heading towards a disappointing goalless draw before Rashford entered as a 71st-minute replacement and fired home a late winner. The Wythenshawe boy screamed in delight and raced to the travelling support for a group hug. The delirium illustrated another element of what makes Rashford special: being a local boy, he fully comprehends the fans’ connection to the side.Rashford’s feet remain on terra firma. He was 19 on the final day of October, has debut goals for United – in Europe, the Premier League, and the Manchester derby – and for the senior England and under-21 sides. Yet there is no sign of any fall-off in focus or attitude.The issue is Ibrahimovic. Rashford has made 13 appearances this season. Ten have been starts, beginning with the 1-0 defeat at Feyenoord on 15 September, which illustrates how he has forced his way into Mourinho’s plans. Yet the statistics suggest his impact is hindered by having to operate out wide because of the manager’s preference for Ibrahimovic.Rashford has played once as the spearhead – against Feyenoord – and has four goals, the others coming in the 3-1 loss at Watford, a 3-1 EFL Cup win at Northampton and in the 4-1 defeat of Leicester City.In the Premier League his shot accuracy rate has halved from last season’s 88.89% to 44.44%, meaning conversion is down from 31.25% to 21.43%. In 11 league starts last term he created two goals and scored five; this season there have been no assists in eight starts and three goals. Those five came every 172 minutes, whereas this season’s have come every 192.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Marcus Rashford: who is Manchester United’s new young hero?Rashford’s last goal was on 24 September so his drought is now seven matches. There would be no surprise, though, if the barren run ended against Arsenal.Before last season’s corresponding game Ron Jamieson, chairman of Rashford’s first club, Fletcher Moss Rangers, told the Guardian: “When Rooney came in he was moving everybody out of the way. So maybe Rooney should move out the way.”For Saturday’s 12.30pm GMT kick-off at Old Trafford, Ibrahimovic has been forced aside but Rooney still represents an option at centre-forward, as does Anthony Martial. If Rashford gets the nod he will know Mourinho at least views him ahead of the captain and Frenchman for the position.It seems unlikely he can keep Ibrahimovic from being reinstated, though.All Rashford can do is what he has serious form for doing: wrest the contest United’s way by scoring and/or being a key factor and give Mourinho something to consider as the season enters the midwinter period that can decide a team’s fortunes.TopicsManchester UnitedSportblogJosé MourinhoZlatan IbrahimovicMarcus RashfordfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Versus movies are all the rage right now, after the lost son of Krypton took on Gotham’s dark knight in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Iron Man went 10 bloody rounds with Steve Rogers’ patriotic superhero in Captain America: Civil War. So why not take it to the next level? I want to see the gloriously unpretentious team from JK Rowling’s marvelous new wizarding fantasy Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them lining up against Marvel and DC’s top colorfully costumed goliaths, if only because it might tell us something about Hollywood’s rapidly shifting definition of heroism in 2016.Why Fantastic Beasts is a trump card for progressive youth | Catherine Shoard Read moreIn the red, white and blue corner, we might have Captain America, 6ft and 200lb of muscular superhero brawn in the shape of star Chris Evans. And perhaps Batfleck himself, a whopping 6ft4in and 228lb of brutally Herculean dark knight of Gotham.Over on the other side of the ring? Yes, it’s Britain’s slender Eddie Redmayne (aka tweedy wizard Newt Scamander) – who one suspects has never visited a gym in his life – alongside Brooklyn-born actor Dan Fogler, who plays cuddly New York muggle (OK, No-Maj) Jacob Kowalski in Fantastic Beasts. The bell has only just been rung for round one, but what’s this? It looks like Rowling’s noobs are already on top.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Fantastic Beasts cast: ‘A bunch of squirrels together ... that’s pretty fantastic’ – video interviewFor while there have been some excellent comic book movies in 2016 – Civil War, Doctor Strange and Deadpool all shifting the zeitgeist in their own way – this has also been a year of disappointment and diminishing returns, with Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad pummeled with critical brickbats and 20th Century Fox’s X-Men: Apocalypse also drawing lukewarm reviews. Marvel might make it look easy, but it turns out this whole superhero “cinematic universe” thing is anything but.Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them review – JK Rowling goes steampunk Read moreThe comic book movie genre, so popular over the past decade, suddenly looks vulnerable. And not just because Warner Bros can’t get its house together when it comes to the studio’s all-new, painfully received DC Expanded Universe. For JK Rowling’s impressively imagined, immaculately plotted tale of witchy goings-on in 1920s New York almost looks like the antidote to our current fascination with comic-book titans. At the very least, it paints a rather more attainable vision of heroism than we might have been used to seeing in blockbuster fare in recent times.Out go musclebound alpha males, impossibly attractive Nietzschean supermen in tight-fitting clothing; in come heroes we can identify with, who look a lot more like us – and a lot less like the us we might imagine ourselves becoming if we spent all our time pounding weights and knocking back egg whites and chicken breast.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them trailer: Eddie Redmayne in Harry Potter spinoff Batman might be a psychologically scarred weirdo who hunts bad guys in a vain attempt to excise the aching memories of his parents’ deaths, but he’s also a billionaire playboy who lives in an enormous mansion, stages ostentatious parties with the world’s press watching and (in the Zack Snyder era) makes Trump-like remarks to an incognito Wonder Woman. Kind of a jock then.His counterpart in Fantastic Beasts, Redmayne’s Newt Scamander, is a geeky magical Dr Dolittle, all battered threads and humble, old-fashioned charm, as if he spends so much time looking after his beloved magical creatures that there’s not much left for taking care of his own appearance. His friend Jacob is – wait for it – a wannabe baker who makes it clear early on that the way to his heart is through his stomach. As templates for heroism, these are like little we’ve seen in blockbuster fare since The Hobbit trilogy a couple of years back, or even Rowling’s own Potter films before that.'Passionate and profound': readers on Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them Read moreWe haven’t mentioned the ladies yet. While the superhero genre has so far offered us mostly female heroes who are either playing second fiddle to the boys or are (at worst) only onscreen for the purpose of objectification, Fantastic Beasts gives us sisters Porpentina and Queenie Goldstein, one a fretting but likeable wannabe auror, the other a flirtatious minx whose beauty is never as important to Rowling as the heart in her chest so big it’s fit to burst. Scamander may be the oddball star of the show, but his new friends have also been made from thrillingly unorthodox moulds.If you think this whole Fantastic Beasts-v-superheroes argument is an artificially conceived tussle, consider this: Marvel has at least eight movies heading for theaters between now and 2020, with DC planning a similar level of output. Meanwhile, Warner Bros announced recently that there would eventually be five films in the Fantastic Beasts saga. Along with Star Wars, these are going to be the big movie sagas battling it out for space at the multiplex over the next decade or so. The vision of heroism they present matters.Superheroes have always been unattainably perfect physical specimens, and that’s fine as far as it goes. But in this age of Trumpian alpha males, it’s good to see a gentler, less ostentatious form of valor making a return to the big screen. If Rowling’s new saga can repeat the feats of the Potter movies, once the highest-grossing film franchise of all time (before being overtaken by Marvel and Star Wars), the beloved author might just achieve more than simply saving Warner Bros from its own ineptitude. In Fantastic Beasts, everyone is desperately looking for Scamander’s escaped creatures. But Rowling’s search for a kinder and more inclusive form of Hollywood heroism may ultimately be the more vital quest.TopicsMoviesFilm blogSuperhero moviesScience fiction and fantasyJK RowlingEddie RedmayneMarvelblogpostsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
The federal government will set up an advisory body to encourage private businesses to do more to recruit veterans and has promised to lead by example in employing them.On Thursday, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, announced the government will establish an advisory committee of corporations that will help industry develop strategies to recruit and retain veterans in employment.Participating businesses will be given the title “Veteran Employment Ambassador” and the government will give awards to businesses of all sizes that employ veterans.The government has also promised a “no discharge without documentation” policy to guarantee proper paperwork when someone leaves the military. Veterans will receive job coaching and materials to help find work.Launching the initiative at Kirribilli House with veterans and business leaders, Turnbull said the program was “not about charity, we’re not asking businesses to engage in some sort of philanthropic exercise”.He spoke about the skills of ex-servicemen and women including use of state-of-the art technology, logistics, resilience, loyalty and courage.Turnbull said the government would “never instruct business to hire veterans as a patriotic obligation” but invited them to “feel free to do so”. He committed the government to “act as an exemplar in employing ex-servicemen and women”.The veterans affairs minister, Dan Tehan, told ABC News Breakfast that 5,500 defence force personnel leave the military every year and they spend an average of 7.5 years in the force.“They have wonderful skills. They learn wonderful things while they’re serving our country and those skills are readily deployable to the civilian workforce,” he said.Military suicide rate 'a national shame' as 41 take own lives since start of 2016 Read more“What we are doing today is making sure that business in Australia and the public sector ... understand [their] skills ... so when they transition away from defence life to civilian life, those employers recognise those skills and will seek to employ our retiring defence personnel.”Tehan told ABC’s AM the government’s initiative would “ensure” that business and the public sector “are considering veterans when they are advertising jobs”.Labor’s defence spokesman, Richard Marles, and veterans’ affairs spokeswoman, Amanda Rishworth, welcomed the veterans’ employment program and suggested a review within 12 months to ensure it is effective.“Labor has long said when there is more we can do to support our veterans it should be done,” they said. “We know employment opportunities for veterans and their families create better opportunities for transition into civilian life.”Tehan also trumpeted measures in the 2016 budget to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and alcohol and substance abuse. “Now anyone who has served for a day currently with our military or who is now a veteran ... you can get free access to the treatment in those areas. It doesn’t have to be service-related.”A report in August found that 41 military personnel and veterans had taken their own lives this year, the same as the number of Australians who were killed in Afghanistan during 13 years of war.TopicsAustralian defence forceAustralian politicsMalcolm TurnbullCoalitionBusiness (Australia)newsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Laura Rolfe has always had private health insurance, because her mum always had it and she believed that “it’s just what you do”.The 29-year-old account manager convinced her husband, Jason, that it was something he needed to have as well, fearing he might be left in the lurch if illness or injury struck.“He didn’t have it when we first got together,” Rolfe says. Productivity Commission calls to privatise public health and housing Read moreThey pay $100 each in premiums a month, an investment Rolfe thought would prove worthwhile when they found out Jason, a music teacher, had a deviated septum, affecting his ability to teach and play his primary instrument, the trumpet.“One of his nostrils was fully deviated and he was only getting 10% airflow through it,” Rolfe says.“But when we went and saw the ear, nose and throat surgeon, he told us we were not covered by our insurance. We were entitled to nothing on the anaethetist, or the surgeon. It was going to cost us about $9,000.” It’s virtually impossible for the average person to make a comparison or indeed know what their cover isGraeme SamuelThe couple could not afford it. But the public system, Rolfe has learned, will cover the entire surgery, though the downside is they will have no control over when that surgery is scheduled or how long he will spend on the waiting list.“I feel like we’ve been paying for private health insurance for so long now that we should have at least been covered for something. This process made me realise just how uninformed I was about what was covered and what was not, but also how hard it is to decide what kind of insurance to get.”‘No easy answers’Rolfe is far from alone. The private health insurance ombudsman reports that it received 4,265 complaints from consumers in the 2014-15 financial year, an increase of 24% on the previous year. chart - complaints“There are no easy answers about how to address the rise in complaints about health insurance, as many are related to decisions made by health insurers in attempting to keep health insurance premiums lower by making changes to health insurance policies; and by consumers choosing health insurance policies with restrictions and exclusions, in return for paying a lower premium,” the ombudsman’s annual report says. There is market failure when there is such a gap of informationGraeme SamuelThe former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission head, Prof Graeme Samuel, a former adviser to the federal government’s private health insurance review, says there are about 40,000 variations of private health insurance policy available.“Can you imagine how complex it is for people to compare policies, or to understand the cover they have got?” Samuel, a professor at Monash business school, tells Guardian Australia.“There is market failure. That is, although you have 34 insurers in the market, because of the complexities of policy and obfuscation about exclusions, gaps cover, and inclusions, it’s virtually impossible for the average person to make a comparison or indeed know what their cover is.“The insurers say, ‘Of course there is competition. We have 34 insurers’. But there’s not. There is market failure when there is such a gap of information that the consumer can’t easily find what it is that they’re getting and compare the cost of the insurance with the extent of the cover.”My patient had private health insurance for peace of mind. Then he got cancer | Ranjana Srivastava Read moreSamuel says even he found the issue of private health policy difficult to navigate. He recently looked into a “gold” policy with a private health insurer that offered cover for cataracts, hip and knee replacement and “other common procedures”. “What does ‘other common procedures’ mean?“I looked through their entire website and couldn’t find an answer. I called them and asked. I said would I be covered for intussusception, a folding of the bowel? Would I be covered? They said; ‘We don’t know.’ I said what about hernia? They said, ‘We’re pretty sure that would be covered.’ Pretty sure? So how would I know?”For people who are healthy and not yet approaching old age, the incentives for getting private health insurance are financial rather than health-related, he adds. The Medicare levy surcharge means people without private health insurance and who earn more than $90,000 are taxed more than $1 for every $100 they earn.Should you get private health insurance? Try our interactive calculator Read moreAnd the lifetime health cover surcharge goes up by 2% every year a person delays taking out private health insurance after the age of 31 and until the age of 65. Many people simply take out one of the lower cost private health insurance policies because it works out cheaper than these surcharges. There are also means-tested government rebates for taking out private health insurance.“State governments would prefer you going into the private system as it relieves their health budget,” Samuel says. “The problem is that whether it is worth it for you depends on your tax position and personal circumstances and then analysis about lifetime cover and Medicare surcharge and the like, so it gets quite complicated and it is very, very difficult to work out.”Private health insurance – ‘not a rational choice’Centre for Policy Development research fellow Ian McAuley, who has undertaken extensive research into the private health insurance industry, is a self-confessed “great critic of private health insurance”.“And I have a stock answer to the question, ‘Is it worth it?’” he says. “If you’re over 75, or if you are a heavy drinker and smoker and grossly overweight and having random unprotected sex and take up hang-gliding, private health insurance is a great product. If you are thinking of getting pregnant, get it, and as soon as you have a baby, drop it.” The biggest users of private health insurance are those aged between 60 and 79, who are more likely to need knee and hip replacements, heart surgery and suffer from chronic diseases. People try to buy out of risk in certain areas of their life. We can’t, but we try to.Ian McAuleyFor this reason, McAuley describes private health insurance as “an instrument transferring funds from the young to the old”.There is also good evidence that people were increasingly downgrading their cover to the bare necessity in the face of rising premiums, which had almost doubled since 2002, he says. chart - PHI profits“Over the last three years or so, average incomes in real terms have hardly moved,” McAuley says. “In fact they’ve gone down by some measures. When incomes fall, people’s response is to look at discretionary spending and say, ‘Where can we save a buck?’ Either they drop private health insurance altogether or – more likely – they lower their level of cover.”He says another issue with private health insurance is that the average consumer doesn’t discover whether their policy is worthwhile until the time they need to use it, which could be years after they start paying premiums. For most consumers, it is hard to predict which health problems might strike down the track and take out insurance accordingly.“Markets work well when you get quick feedback, but what’s going on here is a market with a hell of a lag,” McAuley says. “If you go and buy a bottle of beer and it’s pretty bad you don’t buy it again. The trouble with insurance is you take it out at age 31 or because you hit the income limit, with luck you probably won’t claim for a long, long time. Our hospitals are being privatised. Is anybody paying attention? | Amy Corderoy Read more“If you go 20 years without a major claim and then you get a serious ailment and suddenly you get hit with all these surcharges you didn’t know about, you feel pretty ripped off.”As of 30 June 2015, 11.3 million Australians were covered by hospital treatment cover (47% of the population) and 13.3m had some form of general treatment cover (55.8% of the population). chart - PHI membershipMcAuley says surveys show the main reasons people take out insurance are security and peace of mind, which override even financial incentives.“It’s not a rational choice,” he says. “People try to buy out of risk in certain areas of their life. We can’t, but we try to. It means people can pay for a long time without question. People tend to over-insure, particularly for small risks, and that’s why ancillary cover [also known as extras cover] is so popular. It’s a lousy product, ancillary cover, even with all the tax breaks. But a lot of people get it.”The public hospital mythMcAuley says some are surprised to learn that the public hospital system often provided equal care to the private system, and that many surgeons working in the private system also operate in the public one.  I don’t think as as society we should accept that money gets you priority treatment for healthcareIan McCauleyFor heart attacks, serious cancers, and emergencies, people could expect treatment in the public hospital system straight away, he says. Many obstetricians also work in both the public and private systems.Those requiring hip or knee replacements and other elective surgery will likely find themselves waiting longer without private health insurance, he admits. But he says this demonstrates an unfair health system, rather than the effectiveness of private health insurance.“All that’s happening is the queue getting reshuffled,” he says. “There is only a certain number of surgeons and operating theatres in Australia so if you get preference because of private health, someone else is getting knocked back down the line.“It should be catered for on a needs basis. We might accept that if you are well-off you pay a higher copayment but I don’t think as as society we should accept that money gets you priority treatment for healthcare.”A lack of transparency Jennifer Doggett, a health policy analyst who has worked as a political adviser within the federal health department, says surgeons often have influence over how quickly their public hospital patients are operated on, and having private health insurance isn’t always a benefit.“Hospitals decide whether people get treated in the public or private system, and that’s a process which is very non-transparent,” Doggett says.“Often doctors have a big say. Often the same doctor works in public and private and now, with private hospitals colocated next to public ones you’re often talking about a trip across the walkway. “They’re not supposed to do this but if they know you have private health insurance they [doctors] might only offer you private rooms or paint a picture of the waiting lists being longer than they are.  If you talk to private health insurance, there is a beat-up that the public hospital system can’t be relied onStephen Duckett“There is a reasonable amount of discretion from doctors about when and where they treat patients and bumping public patients up lists. People might be surprised our public health system offers world class conditions and care beyond what you’d get in private.”She adds that good data that existed on the performance and post-surgery outcomes for surgeons is not publicly available, so it is not as though consumers can make informed decisions about which surgeons they prefer.A health economist with the Grattan Institute, Stephen Duckett, says, “if you talk to private health insurance, there is a beat-up that the public hospital system can’t be relied on”. “I don’t think that’s true.”He adds that there is little incentive for healthy people on a low income to take private health insurance policies out.“My daughter turned 21 this year and we got letters from my insurers saying she’s no longer covered,” Duckett said. “She said; ‘Should I take out health insurance, dad?’ I said no. Between 21 and 30, she doesn’t have to worry.” How to choose and junk policiesA spokeswoman for the consumer advocacy group Choice, Nicola Breen, says there are some key questions people need to consider in determining whether private health insurance is worth it. For hospital cover, people should consider why they want it, she says. “Is it primarily for tax reasons or peace of mind?” she says. “Are you planning a family, concerned about mental health or a specific issue which could mean a lengthy wait at a public hospital? Choice believes top cover policies with an excess are often the best value as they provide full private hospital cover, but the excess means premiums are heavily discounted.“Try considering extras cover as a budgeting tool rather than insurance. It’s worth it if you can claim more back than you spend on premiums. If not, avoid it.”There are several types of policies Choice describes as “junk” and advises consumers to avoid altogether. These include public hospital policies which only allow treatment in a public hospital because they do not mean patients can bypass the public hospital waiting list, a key reason people take out insurance. And private hospital policies that only cover a small number of procedures like accidents, wisdom teeth removal, appendix surgery, knee investigations and reconstructions, but exclude everything else, are also fairly worthless, Choice believes. These include policies that offer private hospital cover for accident and ambulance only, with all other services and illnesses excluded.Genetic testing should not be used to diagnose coeliac disease, experts say Read moreChoice identified the following policies as being in the “junk” category: AHM White Starter, AHM White Lite and AHM White Lite Saver, Australian Unity Basic Hospital, Defence Health Essentials Hospital, HBF Super Saver Hospital Cover and HBF Super Saver Hospital With Gap Saver, HIF Gold Vital, Medibank Hospital Essentials, NIB Basic Hospital, Qantas Basic Hospital, HCF Accident Hospital Only Cover and Medibank Accident Cover.“Don’t expect to be able to claim the entire bill when it comes to extras,” Breen says. “On average, only around 50% of the bill is refunded, a greater percentage back means more expensive premiums. Also, be sure to check how much you can expect to claim for specific services. For example a $1,000 limit for dental won’t help if you can only claim $40 for a consult.“For hospital cover, look at exclusions and restrictions. A restriction means the policy will only cover you as as a private patient in a public hospital for that service, which means it would still be subject to public hospital waiting lists.”Moves towards reformLate last year the health minister, Sussan Ley, acknowledged that the private health insurance system was in need of reform and consulted widely with consumers and other interested groups. More than 40,000 people also responded to an online survey.A spokesman for Ley tells Guardian Australia that almost 200 written submissions were received from interest groups during that process, and that Ley is currently considering a summary of those reports.The consultations raised common themes around people’s concerns, he says: poor value for money; high out-of-pocket costs for consumers; lack of transparency; a lack of sustainability; and complex regulation.It echoes the findings of a ReachTel poll of 1,144 residents across Australia conducted on 12 September and commissioned by the Medical Technology Association of Australia which found 78% of respondents either strongly agreed or agreed with the statement “private health insurers put profits before patients”.The poll found 69.2% had considered downgrading or dropping their policy in the past 12 months, jumping to 75.4% of those aged 18-34. Findings from Apra showing a small decline in membership from 47.4% to 47% in the year to June 2016, and that most people are lowering their coverage rather than dropping it altogether.Why can’t our leaders learn from 30 years of failure in health and education? | John Quiggin Read moreAs part of the 2016-17 budget, the government announced it would establish a private health ministerial advisory committee to provide technical and specialist advice on designing and implementing reforms to private health insurance. Dr Jeffrey Harmer, who led the 2008 review of the adequacy of the aged and disability support pensions, was announced as chair of that committee last month.“It’s an area of health where, if Ley can really get this going, a large number of Australians will really thank her,” Samuel says.Do you have a story about private health insurance to share?

The musician Mose Allison, who has died aged 89, could count the Who, the Clash, Bonnie Raitt, Van Morrison and Georgie Fame among the fans of his acerbic songs. His scalpel-sharp lyrics were underpinned by assiduous researches of a line that went all the way back to the earliest roots of the blues.Allison always managed to sound cool and in a hurry at the same time. Needing nothing more than a piano, a microphone and a rhythm section to fire off his own biting updates on country-blues, he would hustle through his repertoire of laconic social commentary, and the classic songs of Tampa Red, Willie Dixon and many others, as if trying to squeeze a Delta discography into a single set.Rarely pausing for banter or biographical musings about himself or his heroes, the spare, faintly donnish Allison would clatter into the opening of a song when the last syllable of its namecheck was barely out of his mouth. The restless urban urgency of his methods brought a modernity (via bebop) to the earthy materials of the Delta, and a sophisticated irony to the direct and often accusatory themes of the blues.The pianist, singer and occasional trumpeter never adapted his light, southern-inflected conversational voice to the spine-tingling hollers or the muscular laments of traditional blues. He used it instead as an almost rap-like, rhythmic monotone – the dynamics sometimes varied by an explosive, sustained sound, but more usually echoing a drummer’s busy, preoccupied mutter.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Mose Allison performing on the BBC’s Later … With Jools Holland in 2005. Photograph: Andre Csillag/Rex/ShutterstockIn his early years, he was a piano accompanist and not a singer, working for various top saxophonists, and his keyboard playing retained a delightful eccentricity throughout his career, an uncategorisable style of whirling runs and marching left-hand countermelodies that was his alone.And though the lyrics of Allison’s best songs became well known, his performances could always produce freshly disconcerting versions of the devastating one-liners that included “your mind’s on vacation but your mouth’s working overtime”, “I’m nobody today but I was somebody last night” and “ever since the world ended, I don’t go out so much”. “Mose, you got a good thing goin’,” Sonny Boy Williamson said to him. Dixon called him “a beautiful musician”.Allison was born on his grandfather’s farm, near the village of Tippo, just inside the eastern rim of the Mississippi Delta. His father took over the business, and his mother taught at the local school – a connection that gave the boy a lifelong love of literature that significantly influenced his resources as a songwriter. Allison’s father was a good stride-style pianist and, at the age of five, the boy was sent for formal piano lessons. But it was the blues, boogie-woogie music and jazz he heard on the jukeboxes that really turned his head.In a predominantly black corner of the US’s cotton-farming country in the 1930s, Allison recollected that 60% of the jukebox fare would be country blues, and the remainder the big-band bravura of Count Basie and Tommy Dorsey – and he loved both. A gifted natural improviser, he was also attracted to the trumpet by the music of Louis Armstrong, studying the instrument in high school and performing with it in local marching bands and dance bands.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Mose Allison in London in 1986. Photograph: AvalonRex/ShutterstockBut family caution rather than the lure of jazz and blues determined Allison’s next step and he went to the University of Mississippi to study chemical engineering. Army bands allowed him to return to the trumpet and piano during a year of military service, however, and in 1947 he returned to college (this time as an economics major) but also became the leader of a jazz trio and a composer/arranger for the college band. He pulled out of full-time education a second time, to take a six-nights-a-week job playing piano and singing in a cocktail lounge near Lake Charles, Indiana, then moved to Louisiana State University to study English and philosophy, graduating in 1952.But Allison’s career was beginning to roll by now. He began working all over the south-east and as far north as Denver, then went to New York to sample the frenetic modern jazz and bebop scene in 1956. He played piano with the saxists Stan Getz, Zoot Sims and Gerry Mulligan, but the invigorating New York scene encouraged him to draw together all the disparate influences in his musical sensibilities: the relaxed swing piano of Nat King Cole and Erroll Garner, the various angles on bebop adopted by Thelonious Monk, John Lewis and Al Haig, and, of course, the distant childhood sounds of the blues singers.Like Miles Davis in the same period, Allison was finding that bop could become a mechanical, formulaic exercise, and he was looking for something else. In 1957, Allison made Back Country Suite for the Prestige label, and, the following year, an Allison trio made its debut at the Café Bohemia in New York – with a young drummer, Paul Motian, who was later to become a star.Allison’s interweaving of swing’s elegance and his own eccentrically bumpy, bop-influenced rhythmic sense marked the arrival of a significant new force. He brought together a mix of jazz and country sounds new to 50s east coast hipsters, and on a single sung track (simply called Blues) he seemed to be opening up possibilities for a white voice exploring black material creatively rather than as pastiche that anticipated the white R&B boom of the decade still to come.Albums such as Local Color (1957) and Autumn Song (1959) followed, with the first briefly featuring Allison’s muted trumpet and a haunting examination of Duke Ellington’s Don’t Ever Say Goodbye, and the second including more vocals, and some straight bop piano on one of the idiom’s classics, Groovin’ High. But he still saw himself as a pianist at least as much as a singer in this period, continuing to work with Getz intermittently – including a month-long engagement at the Montmartre club, Copenhagen, where the two performed as a duo.Allison’s best songs surfaced ever more prolifically in the period between 1960 and 1964, with I Don’t Worry About a Thing, Your Mind Is on Vacation and Don’t Forget to Smile appearing on an impeccable series of albums for Atlantic. He began to tour internationally through the 60s and 70s, and his bluesy vocals and the enthusiasm of such influential fans as Morrison helped him avoid the effects of the rock-driven downturn in jazz’s fortunes in that period.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Mose Allison sings Your Mind Is on VacationAllison appeared in Jeff Stein’s 1979 rock documentary The Kids Are Alright, about the Who, who covered his Young Man Blues. Regularly working with the bassist Mel Graves and drummer George Marsh, Allison toured steadily, and moved to the Elektra and then Blue Note labels in the 80s. The latter company sought to rebrand him through collaborations with various guests – from the New Orleans band on My Backyard (1989) to contemporary jazz stars including the trumpeter Randy Brecker, saxophonist Joe Lovano and guitarist John Scofield on The Earth Wants You in 1994.But Allison never sounded better than when left to himself and he confirmed that the acuity of his observational powers was undimmed in beginning to turn his muse toward the insights and ironies of senior citizenship. The influence of long-gone southlands guitarists on his piano technique would always be audible under classic songs such as What’s Your Movie?, he would typically impart a defiant rather than romantic air to a standard ballad such as You Are My Sunshine, and the original How Much Truth (Can a Man Stand?), delivered without an iota of reproof, could always tingle the spine.At the PizzaExpress jazz club in London, which he took to visiting twice a year in the 90s and early 2000s, Allison would sometimes seem to be in a fascinating private reverie, in which stomping bluesy figures would wrestle with swirling, wind-in-trees melodies, or turn into a jerky clatter like a silent-movie soundtrack. Ain’t Got Nothing But the Blues, Trouble in Mind and Knock on Wood might hurtle by in a blur.The pungency and vigour of Allison’s work with local sidemen at the PizzaExpress was admirably caught on a fine collection by Blue Note Records in 2000 – The Mose Chronicles: Live in London Volumes 1 & 2. But after 1998, suspicious of studios and record companies, he avoided them until the producer Joe Henry tempted him back for the LA label Anti in 2008.The result, a mix of covers and originals entitled The Way of the World and featuring a duet with his daughter, Amy, revealed the octogenarian to be to be just as sardonic, incisive, and vocally and instrumentally quirky as ever. In 2013, Allison was named a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, and performed his song Was at the ceremony, with Amy accompanying him.Back in the memorable days of Allison’s London visits, he would sometimes intone his 1982 album title “Just another middle-class white boy trying to have some fun,” as the piano notes flew by. That childhood pastime went on to work its inimitable magic for almost six decades.Allison is survived by his wife, Audre Mae, and four children, Alissa, Amy, John and Janine.• Mose Allison (John Allison Jr), musician, born 11 November 1927; died 15 November 2016TopicsMusicJazzStan GetzMississippiobituariesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
‘Stalinesque purge’ overshadows Trump transitionPresident-elect Donald Trump’s transition team appeared to be in chaos on Tuesday after one member was forced to step down in what one report described as a “Stalinesque purge”. Former Republican congressman Mike Rogers was earmarked to be national security adviser before leaving the talks, which are taking place in Trump Tower in New York. The president-elect rejected rumors that his children were trying to get top-level security clearance as a “false news story”. The team tasked with making key appointments before Trump takes office in January is being led by vice-president-elect Mike Pence, who replaced New Jersey governor Chris Christie. Trump, star of the reality TV show The Apprentice, hoped to offer reassurance last night, tweeting that the transition process was “very organized”. “I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!” he added.Donald Trump transition team in disarray after key adviser ‘purged’Republicans hold their tongue over Bannon Republicans avoided questions about Trump’s new White House chief strategist, Steve Bannon, who has a record of promoting antisemitic, anti-Muslim and misogynistic content while overseeing the “alt-right” website Breitbart News. As members of Congress returned to work on Tuesday, they refused to criticize Trump’s latest appointee. “I don’t want to accuse a man of being antisemitic or racist whom I’ve never met,” said Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina. He added of Breitbart: “The website in question was a friendly site to the alt-right.

As late as the 1980s, it was not unusual to come across older people bemused by the idea of rectilinear breaded seafood. “Who ever saw a fish with fingers?” your grandad might scoff. Not because he was a foodie (no one was in 1986) but simply because he could remember a time when food did not come pre-packed, frozen and reshaped so that it bore no visual resemblance to its animal origin.Grandad was fighting a losing battle. Thirty years on, in this supposed nation of food lovers, fish fingers remain wildly popular. Sales have wobbled in recent years, but we eat more than 1.5m fish fingers a day and, according to market behemoth Birds Eye, 75% of us first taste fish in the form of fish fingers.Fish fingers were once things you grew out of but that is no longer true. This 4am fallback for drunk students is now a staple on pub menus – gussied-up with handmade goujons and tartare sauce, perhaps, but nonetheless testament to the fact that for all their relative blandness (“No bones, no waste, no smell, no fuss,” was Birds Eye’s launch strapline), these crispy cod pieces are – particularly when slapped between two slices of bread – an enduring balm for the soul.Not that making a good fish-finger butty at home is easy. You may think that industrial production (introduced to the UK in the 1950s by US frozen-foods pioneer Clarence Birdseye) would produce a uniform fish finger. But no. At every stage, from the fish itself (usually cut from huge frozen blocks of whole fillets) to the “enrobing” (the technical term for covering fish in batter and breadcrumbs), numerous tiny details have an impact on quality.Which of the supermarket brands are a catch? Which should you throw back? And where does Birds Eye rank these days?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Birds Eye … ‘meagre cod within’ Photograph: PRBirds Eye, 12 cod fish fingers, 336g, £2.50Has Captain Birdseye been hammering the rum? Because for all the packaging’s rhetorical zeal (“Happy families guaranteed”) and its trumpeting of cod’s health benefits, these rather withered-looking fingers fail to dazzle. A mere 8.5cm by 2.5cm – ie basic, primary-school size – their crumb packs a decent, satisfyingly dry crunch, but the meagre cod within (58% of the contents, where most contain 60%) lacks any real solidity and heft. Mostly, it melts away toothlessly; a sweet, slippery, shy presence. On a sandwich, these become an anonymous mush.4/10  Aldi… ‘gloopy’. Photograph: PRAldi, Northern Catch 10 cod fish fingers, 300g, £1.19Like Birds Eye’s, these standard-size fingers are made from Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) approved sustainable cod, which is one of the few positives to report. The fish filling looks apologetically thin (58% of the whole, roughly 7mm thick), and the orange crumb is uneven. Intermittently, it offers an adequate crispiness; elsewhere the texture of worn carpet. Beneath that, you will find a gloopy underlay of undercooked batter, coating that sliver of squishy, textureless fish. The dominant flavours are breadcrumbs and tired cooking oil.2/10      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Waitrose … ‘gunk’. Photograph: PRWaitrose, Frozen 6 MSC line-caught chunky breaded cod fingers, 400g, £3.25Fatter fingers, these (12.5cm by 3.5cm), they are as attractively tanned as a Costa expat. The notably peppery shells are audibly crisp and they (albeit, not as comprehensively as they could be) are filled with a creditably thick layer of robustly textured fillet fish. The problem, however, is gunk: in many places lie millimetres of wet batter, sitting like grey putty under the breadcrumbs, which fundamentally undermines that crunch. You would eat these without complaint, but with no great enthusiasm.6/10      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Tesco … ‘sticky’. Photograph: 36/PRTesco, Finest 6 chunky cod fillet fish fingers, 400g, £2.50“Like eating bland jelly”, “so mushy it’s like they’re filled with wet tissue”, “eerily insubstantial” read my tasting notes. While big (13cm by 3cm), these fingers fail on virtually all fronts. You get the occasional meatier, tastier mouthful (and there is some haphazard crunch in the crumb) but generally these pale fingers are a trudge of damp, woolly fish swaddled in sticky batter, the crumb only loosely adhered to the fish; more blanket than tight coating. A casual two fingers to the consumer.4/10      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   M&S … ‘meaty’. Photograph: PRM&S, 9 chunky breaded cod fish fingers, 360g, £2But for their notable 2cm thickness, these look like kids’ stuff: standard length, golden orange in colour, the coating offering little resistance as you put your fork through it. Chew on, however, and you will find the well-seasoned breadcrumb offers a light, brief residual crunch and a reasonable flavour (albeit one more “fried” than savoury). The (in parts, slightly waterlogged) fish delivers a toothsome, meaty texture and a clear sweetness. Crucially, there is little if any batter residue under the crumb. Overall, not bad.7/10      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Co-OP … ‘mealy’. Photograph: PRCo-Op, Ultimate fish fingers 6, 380g, £3.29A curiosity, these 4cm-wide, MSC-approved fingers are sold fresh not frozen for oven-baking not grilling. The first batch tasted worthy and bland (they need more of the listed salt and cider vinegar), and they required a blast under the grill to strengthen the eventually impressively crackling, crunchy crumb. A significant layer of moist, floury batter under that (still flavourless) crumb undermines it, however. The two combine to produce an overly thick coating for fish that, while sporadically sound, was often mealy and lacking muscular density.5/10       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Asda … ‘claggy’. Photograph: 33/PRAsda, 30 cod fillet fish fingers, 900g, £4Boasting the fish finger’s classic fake tan-orange hue, Asda’s (toothless, gummy) offering will sate ravenous kids, but that is all they are good for. The coating (more a baggy jacket) is gritty if not unpleasantly so, but offers no crisp definition at first bite and, yet again, hides an almost gelatinous substratum of icky batter. The 64% cod content seems generous, until you taste it. It is classic frozen cod: mushy, flavourless, fibrous, chewy. Make a sandwich with these and it would be claggy chore.3/10      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Sainsbury’s … ‘by far the best’. Photograph: PRSainsbury’s, Taste the Difference 8 chunky cod fish fingers, 480g, £3These swollen fingers (9cm by 4cm) are not immune to the problems outlined above. There is some glop under the crumb (giving them a slight gluey edge) and the MSC-approved fish, while persuasively meaty for once, could hardly be said to taste vibrantly of cod. However, with their stand-out 70% cod content and their remarkably flavoursome, stridently crunchy crumb (nicely browned, deeply savoury, sparky with vinegar and pepper), these are, by far, the best in this test. These fingers get a thumbs-up.8/10TopicsFishSupermarket sweepSeafoodFood & drinkfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
1. California Über Alles The debate over what exactly constitutes “punk” is a long and thorny one. Is it a sound? An attitude? Sitting squarely across it are California’s Dead Kennedys, a band punk enough to feature in Rolling Stone’s 40 greatest punk albums but who employed elements of surf guitar, jazz, poetry and even bolero across four studio albums of biting wit, fury and pristine pop songs. Thiss debut single exemplifies their complicated musical relationship with punk. Singer Jello Biafra’s lyrics – a blistering attack on the then governor of California, Jerry Brown (who returned to the post in 2011), which reference the now-unused first stanza of the German national anthem – and Klaus Flouride’s ominous bass riff are typical of the 1979 punk scene into which the song was released. And yet other elements of California Über Alles shy away from the stereotypes of punk rock. Bruce Slesinger’s drums combines a bolero rhythm with militaristic rolls – guitarist East Bay Ray called the song “our Wagnerian piece with a bolero rhythm” – while the opening guitar lines have shades of the gothic surf-rock style that Ray brought to the group.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest 2. Holiday in CambodiaCalifornia Über Alles was followed a year later by Holiday in Cambodia, a masterclass in atmospherics. The opening 20 seconds of rattling bass and sparse, echoing guitar create a mood of musical paranoia that ratchets up several notches with the introduction of the drums, playing a frantic discoesque beat, and a guitar riff that brings to mind Dick Dale playing on as the Titanic slips under the water. The lyrics, meanwhile, are among Biafra’s best, a vicious dissection of the stereotypical college student who has “been to school for a year or two and you know you’ve seen it all”. But what might be most striking about Holiday in Cambodia is how many ideas it packs into its brief running time. In the 3min 43sec single version the song includes two intros, two verses, two rousing choruses, an eerie bridge, a guitar solo, an escalating middle eight and a final chorus, each brilliantly tarred with an air of creeping menace. It’s like all of the good bits of most punk bands compressed into three and a half minutes. The album version adds an ambient guitar intro for good measure, extending the running time to 4min 38sec.3. Pull My StringsDead Kennedys made an almost instant commercial impact in the UK, and in 1981 a deal from Polydor was in the offing, only for Biafra to threaten to quit the band if they signed to a major. Maybe Polydor should have known better: the group’s distinctive attitude towards the music industry was already in evidence in 1980, when they were invited to perform at the Bay Area music awards in San Francisco. The idea, according to the event’s organisers – who probably hadn’t been playing sufficiently close attention to the band’s modus operandi – was to give the event some “new wave credibility”. Sure enough, Dead Kennedys started playing California Über Alles as expected, only for Biafra to stop the song 15 seconds in to proclaim: “We’ve gotta prove that we’re adults now. We’re not a punk rock band, we’re a new wave band.” Dead Kennedys then launched into Pull My Strings, a song written for the occasion, in which they rail against the music industry: “Is my cock big enough, / Is my brain small enough / For you to make me a star?”, ending with a pointed musical nod to the Knack’s new wave anthem My Sharona. Point made, the band would never perform the song again, although the awards version would turn up on Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death, a 1987 compilation that rounded up their non-album songs.4. Too Drunk to FuckIf you looked closely around British secondary schools in the 1980s and 90s, you’d be likely to find Dead Kennedys’ distinctive “DK” logo scratched somewhere. They may never have had the volcanic cultural impact of the Sex Pistols or the Clash but Dead Kennedys remained a hugely important cult band in the decades after their demise. Part of that was down to the catchiness of their songs, which combine massive shout-along choruses with guitar riffs the milkman could whistle. But if we’re being honest, a large part of the band’s enduring appeal to the average adolescent is that their songs can be incredibly rude. Indeed, for all the biting social satire of a song such as Kill the Poor – the band’s third single and a No 49 UK hit – Dead Kennedys’ best-known song is probably the single that followed it in May 1981: Too Drunk to Fuck. It reached No 36 in the British charts – apparently the first Top 40 single to feature the world “fuck” in the title – prompting predictable panic at Radio 1, in record stores and among Top of the Pops producers. It seems characteristic of Biafra that he reserved his most straightforwardly filthy lyric – in which the narrator drinks 16 beers, starts a fight, rolls down the stairs, then finds himself too “sick, soft, gooey and cold” to perform in bed – for what is one of the band’s most brilliantly pop moments, home to both a masterly, surf-inspired ear worm of a guitar riff and a chirpy key change. 5. The PreyIf Too Drunk to Fuck was an example of Dead Kennedys’ sly sense of humour, then its B-side, The Prey, showed a darker, more experimental side to the band. The Kennedys experiment with jazz and noir atmospherics – all wandering bass lines, cymbal splashes and minimal, sharpened guitars – on top of which Biafra relates a darkly poetical tale of a late-night assault, his words crawling lecherously over Flouride’s bass. The result is like the more literary side of the Doors, tainted with a hint of goth. The Prey may be an outlier in the band’s catalogue but it is not without precedent: Night of the Living Rednecks, improvised live at a 1979 concert after East Bay Ray broke a guitar string, sees Biafra tell a tale of being accosted by “jocks in this bright blue pickup” over a meandering jazz backing.6. HalloweenDead Kennedys followed their 1980 debut album, Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, with the In God We Trust, Inc EP in December 1981. It was a frenetic, frantic EP, which paid tribute both to the emerging hardcore punk scene and the skills of their new drummer, DH Peligro, packing eight songs into 14 frenzied minutes. In God We Trust, Inc – the height of the band’s experiments in thrash – was followed by an album that may be their most melodic, Plastic Surgery Disasters. Halloween, the band’s seventh and final single, is typical of Disasters’ pointed melodicism, sporting a dumb-as-rocks guitar riff worthy of the Sex Pistols, singalong bass lines and about three choruses. It is an oddly inspirational song, too. Biafra’s lyrics call for people to break free of social mores in their everyday lives, rather than just on the titular holiday, ending with a call to “take your social regulations and shove ’em up your ass” so rousing it could wake the dead.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest 7. Moon Over MarinA good percentage of rock bands would have hung their careers on a song like Moon Over Marin, the closing track on Plastic Surgery Disasters. It’s the kind of classic rock song that reverberates throughout the ages, a mixture of one of East Bay Ray’s very best guitar riffs, a stirring, melancholic-yet-defiant chorus and wonderfully evocative lyrics about environmental disaster (“Another tanker’s hit the rocks / Abandoned to spill out its guts … Oh, shimmering moonlight sheen upon / The waves and water clogged with oil / White gases steam up from the soil”). In fact, Moon Over Marin has been called “as close as DKs ever came to a ballad” and – for all the song’s chugging Pretty Vacantesque guitar verses – you can see why: it is a genuinely beautiful song, capable of bringing a tear to the eye. For Dead Kennedys, though, it wasn’t even a single, something that speaks to the discord brewing within the band. “Most of the band and our record label at the time wanted to release this as a single; it would have made a great one,” East Bay Ray said in 2015. “But Biafra was concerned about having a song that I wrote be bigger than something he was more involved in – so he didn’t let that happen.”8. Soup Is Good FoodDead Kennedys’ collective morale was hardly helped by the furore over their next album, 1985’s Frankenchrist. Lyrically, Frankenchrist continued the band’s forthright tone, but this time it wasn’t the band’s songs getting them in trouble: it was the album’s packaging, which included a poster of HR Giger’s Penis Landscape, depicting rows of penises and vulvae. (Biafra apparently wanted the picture as the album cover, although the rest of the band vetoed this.) Biafra was brought to trial, accused of distributing harmful matter to minors and, while he was not convicted, the band’s Alternative Tentacles label was almost bankrupted. The legal row understandably overshadowed the music on Frankenchrist, which, although it saw Dead Kennedys introduce trumpet, synths and even a “12-string electric bellzouki” to the mix, was not one of the band’s strongest albums. That said, its opening song Soup Is Good Food demands a place on any round up of the band’s best work, thanks to Biafra’s brilliantly sardonic vocal, a massive, dumb chorus and East Bay Ray’s pointillist guitar, which teeters on the verge of going out of tune at any moment.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest 9. Cesspools in EdenBy 1986, Dead Kennedys weren’t just sick of the mainstream music industry, they were also disillusioned with the hardcore scene, which they felt had become increasingly conformist. By the time the band went into the studio to record their final album, Bedtime for Democracy, they had already played their last gig, and they announced their split soon after the album’s release. It is curious, then, that Bedtime for Democracy saw the band steer closer than ever to the hardcore template of breakneck riffs, tumbling drums and barked vocals, with little of the musical experimentation that had marked their previous albums. Against this background, Cesspools in Eden felt – somewhat ironically given the song’s environmental concerns – like a breath of fresh air, a pause for thought among the hardcore lurch: six minutes of doom-laden guitar chords, sleazy riffs and even a brilliant guitar solo from East Bay Ray, whose contribution lifts the song way above the album’s pedestrian grind, even if the production is too 80s rock for some tastes.10. Short SongsAfter Dead Kennedys split in 1986, relations remained – at least on the surface – workable among the former members, with compilation album Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death released in June 1987 through Alternative Tentacles. In the late 90s, however, a feud emerged between Biafra and the other members of the group, who claimed to have been underpaid by Alternative Tentacles, then under Biafra’s control. That led to a series of lawsuits, with the singer eventually forced to pay damages to the rest of the band. Relationships between the two sides have been sour ever since. So lets remember Dead Kennedys another way, with Short Songs, probably the silliest track in the band’s catalogue and a reminder of better days. Written by 6025 (AKA Carlos Cadona), the band’s second guitarist from July 1978 to March 1979, it originally appeared on Can You Hear Me? Music from the Deaf Club, a 1981 compilation of live recordings from the San Francisco club of the same name. It’s a ridiculous yet strangely logical extension of punk’s obsession with musical back-to-basics. It lasts barely 20 seconds yet manages to pack both winning riff and call-and-response vocal into its sparse running time, coming over like the Ramones high on ice cream in Disneyland.TopicsMusic10 of the bestPop and rockfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Shoppers are being warned that Black Friday deals might not live up to the hype, after an investigation found that many products promoted as being “on sale” last year were actually cheaper before or after the event.Currys and AO are singled out by Which?, the consumer group, which claims they may have broken government guidelines by inflating the “was” price to make promotions look more appetising.“Consumers should be wary of claims of massive savings this Black Friday as they may not be as spectacular as they seem,” said Pete Moorey, the head of campaigns at Which?. “Shoppers might be surprised to learn that only half of Black Friday deals are actually cheapest on Black Friday.”Which? investigated 178 deals from Black Friday 2015 tracking the daily price moves of 20 popular electrical gadgets on Amazon, AO, Argos, Currys and John Lewis for three months before and two months after Black Friday. They found that only 90 deals were cheapest on Black Friday. A Currys promise of a £101 saving on a Samsung TV was not as good as it looked, as the £748 price tag was only a pound less than on the eve of Black Friday and it had been on promotion at £699 in September. AO trumpeted a £200 saving on a Vax vacuum cleaner at £99, yet it had been on sale for £69 the previous day and on average for £96.50 in the three months leading up to Black Friday.Amazon introduced Black Friday discounts to Britain in 2010 but the event is now a fixture of the retail sales calendar with Currys, John Lewis and Argos key players in an event increasingly focused on aggressively discounted electronics and domestic appliances.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A worker at Amazon’s warehouse in Hemel Hempstead. Photograph: Jeff Spicer/Getty ImagesFor many the last weekend of November coincides with the last pay day before Christmas, and analysts at PwC predict Britons will spend £2.9bn over the four days starting on 25 November, up from £2.1bn in 2015.Initially Black Friday, which always falls after the US Thanksgiving holiday, was a 24-hour sale but this year it has been stretched over nearly a fortnight with Amazon starting its event on Monday, offering up to 50% off thousands of products ranging from 70in TVs to cordless screwdrivers and advent calendars. When promoting a discount the “was” price is supposed to be the most recent price the item has been sold at for 28 consecutive days or more. Which? said it found numerous examples where it thinks AO and Currys were not following the government’s pricing practices guidance (PPG) by using an older, higher “was” price. Tesco makes gains as Aldi and Lidl growth hits five-year low Read moreBlack Friday has been Currys biggest trading day for the past three years. The retailer, which is part of the group that owns PC World and Carphone Warehouse, said it “fundamentally disagreed” with the approach taken by Which?.“We comply fully with the PPG guidelines, displaying a clear date from when the ‘was’ price was taken, allowing customers to make a fully informed decision. Currys offered thousands of deals on leading brands over Black Friday in 2015 and this year’s event is set to be even bigger.”An AO spokesperson said: “The internet is the most transparent marketplace ever created for consumers to be able to compare price and service associated with it and we work hard to be exceptional on both fronts. This has been recognised many times by Which? themselves.“We work hard to ensure that any promotions we make are clear and take our obligations to consumers very seriously. “The sheer scale of Black Friday’s great offers means that these are planned up to 12 months in advance to maximise the value and service for our customers. That demands significant planning for a very fluid trading environment across hundreds of offers and we are always focused on offering the best price match promise all year and especially around Black Friday.”TopicsBlack FridayRetail industryOnline shoppingAmazonAO WorldConsumer affairsnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content

In the years since the global financial crisis, proposals from Nobel laureates and professors of economics for fiscal policy stimulus to boost growth have been met with widespread derision. This was mainly from the proponents of fiscal austerity, who can only see cuts to government spending as a solution to all economic ills, despite the moribund state of the global economy.But such economic quackery is being called out by someone who, oddly, appears to the master of quackery, the US president-elect, Donald Trump. What a turn-up for the books. But the Trump win and his economic agenda has exposed a critical problem for the progressive side of politics in Australia and around the world.Joseph Stiglitz: what the US economy needs from Donald Trump Read moreWhen a bombastic businessman, with a void of economic understanding, accidentally becomes president of the United States and indicates that he will oversee a fiscal stimulus based on an infrastructure and defence spending spree, there is a surging stock market, forecasts of stronger economic growth and all-of-a-sudden analysis that such policy stimulus is overdue.As Basil Fawlty might say, “special subject, the bleeding obvious”.It is intriguing to see the instant analysis from many unworldly Wall Street analysts and Washington thinktank specialists that the US economy will be strong because of the extra government spending Trump is outlining. The hypocrisy is breathtaking.Not that long ago, the Obama administration and US government was brought to the brink of closure when the Republicans in Congress postponed the rise in the debt ceiling until the 11th hour because it judged fiscal policy to be too loose. They and their ilk demanded cuts in spending to address what was a moderate problem on the US budget even though economic growth was weak, unemployment was high and deflation pressures were building.The US economy was held to ransom by the fiscal austerity economic pretenders and suffered as a result.Having demanded a reduction in government debt from about 90% of gross domestic product a few years ago, there now seems to be an acceptance that a path of US debt to 120% of GDP – but under Trump and not Obama or Clinton – is great economic policy.Australian share market expected to face months of uncertainty due to Donald Trump's win Read moreThat said, there are other economic threats from the Trump policy agenda and these are not just to the rest of the world but also to the US economy. There is much more to Trumpenomics than the current focus on the fiscal stimulus measures.Even if the Trump proposals for a preposterous 45% tax on Chinese imports and the accusations of currency manipulation are watered down, there is little doubt that Beijing and other capitals hurt by any rise in US trade restrictions would retaliate in kind.US companies might encounter difficulties in a world where trade flows are inhibited. US businesses make more than $2tn a year from their overseas operations and, if their access to global markets is constrained, this figure would obviously be under threat.For every job saved in the US from import restrictions, there may well be a different one or even two jobs lost from damage to US exports, trade and investment.For years now, the Australian Labor party and other progressive left parties around the world have been too scared to strongly argue the case for an increase in the size of government, including higher spending, as they have been hamstrung by fear of the political difficulties. This has also been evident in the agenda when trying to make a case for, let alone implementing, policies that redistribute income from the well-off to the less well-off.But it appears that Trump is about to trump the left on the issue of fiscal stimulus as a virtue for growth. If only the Democrats had made the case in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, the US economy would have been stronger, the disaffected voters would have been less inclined to swing to Trump and Hillary Clinton would likely be president.TopicsAustralian economyBusiness (Australia)Donald TrumpLabor partyBill ShortenAustralian politicscommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content

Photograph: Donald Trump Republicans declined to criticize Donald Trump’s decision to appoint Steve Bannon as the chief strategist to his impending administration, despite the latter’s record of promoting white supremacy.As lawmakers returned to Washington on Tuesday for the first time since Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, Democrats swiftly called on the president-elect to rescind his hiring of Bannon.But Republicans said it was time to unify behind Trump and sidestepped questions on his promotion of antisemitic, anti-Muslim and misogynist content while overseeing the “alt-right” website Breitbart News.“I don’t want to accuse a man of being antisemitic or racist whom I’ve never met,” said Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina told reporters on Capitol Hill when asked about the Bannon appointment.“I’ve never met him. I wouldn’t know him if he walked in the door,” he said, before adding of Breitbart: “The website in question was a friendly site to the alt-right.

However, he stressed he was not planning to fight Trump through the courts.Instead, he would focus on “trying to present an opposite point of view and trying to get that point of view expressed, and communicated to citizens.”Steyer’s pledge to fight Trump suggests an intensifying battle for U.S. public opinion on global climate change, an issue that has already divided many Americans, lawmakers, and companies between those who consider it a major global threat and those who doubt its existence.

My friend Victor Brown, who has died aged 95, was a singer with an attractive tenor voice who achieved fame in the last days of British variety as half of the urbane musical duo Harriott and Evans (Victor’s stage name).One of 10 children, he was born in Banes, Cuba, to Jamaican parents, John, an engineer, and his wife, Miriam (whose maiden name was also Brown). Victor left Jamaica in 1939 as an engine-room seaman; once in Britain he signed up for the war effort as a steward on tankers. In 1944 he made newspaper headlines when his ship was torpedoed, leaving him to cut the lifeboat away from the sinking vessel – “Burly West Indian Saved Crew”.Back in Britain, he sang and played the guitar with Ensa (Entertainments National Service Association) and for dances organised by the League of Coloured Peoples. He formed a duo with his younger brother, Noel, as the Brown Brothers, and played in nightclubs with the guitarist Lauderic Caton. He joined the dance-and-drum troupe of veteran West African Prince Zulamkah, then formed a short-lived act with the pianist Winifred Atwell.In 1943 Victor married Kameedea Packwood, the daughter of an English civil servant and Ghanaian mother; in 1947 went to work as a nurse in West Africa, where Vic joined her, in a move reflecting the pan-African spirit of the times. In Ghana he sang with musicians including the trumpeter ET Mensah, and went into partnership in a timber enterprise. He managed a hotel in Kumasi, where he sang with a band that included drummer Guy Warren (Kofi Ghanaba). When his business ventures failed, the couple were made homeless, and were helped by Warren, who doubled as a campaigning journalist.The couple returned to Britain, where Kameedea turned to teaching and Victor re-entered show business. Their West African connections took him and Noel to the Gateways Club in Chelsea, where a fellow Jamaican, Chester Harriott, played the piano for an enthusiastic audience before forming a harmony duo with Victor, now known as Vic Evans.The pair wore white tie and tails for cabaret and in Paris they socialised with jazz musicians, getting Quincy Jones to write for their act and carousing with trumpeters Clifford Brown and Art Farmer. For eight years Harriott and Evans toured and played on radio and television, and if the charismatic, moustachioed pianist attracted greater attention, it was universally agreed that Victor was the better singer.In the 1990s, Victor and Kameedea moved to Lancashire, eventually settling in Morecambe.Kameedea predeceased him. He is survived by three daughters.TopicsMusicOther livesJamaicaGhanaobituariesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
They are among the hardest working men and women in football. Even before Spain arrive at Wembley on Tuesday night to provide the latest obstacle to the tottering baby steps of Gareth Southgate’s tenure as England manager, those whose job it is to continue to fill Wembley began trumpeting their wares for March’s home qualifier against Lithuania.No matter how big the humiliation or how small the pool of English talent, the masses keep trudging up Olympic Way for the friendlies and qualifying ties that keep the FA’s tills ringing and have helped contribute to a changed financial picture which, the FA chief executive Martin Glenn told an industry event last week, will boost its revenues by £100m a year. “The Wembley Stadium proposition is profitable, it is not a stone in our shoe any more,” he said.FA plucks Gareth Southgate for England job from a bare cupboard | Daniel Taylor Read moreRemarkably, more than 80,000 fans are expected at Wembley for the Spain match. A similar number turned up to watch the workmanlike 2-0 victory over Malta, Southgate’s first in charge following Sam Allardyce’s shambolic exit, and on Friday night the official attendance was 87,258 – bolstered by a big contingent of well refreshed but ultimately despondent Scots.Question the value of some of those at the FA all you like, but there can be little doubt that those who fill Wembley through a combination of ticket offers, family deals and canny stretch pricing are earning their corn. And all this at a time when England’s stock has arguably never been lower.Given the apathy and general feeling of tumbleweed blowing through the Sky Sports News studios when international week rolls around – particularly the breaks in October and November that interrupt the league season just as it is getting going – that is a remarkable achievement.Likewise, the fact that an average of 7 million viewers watched England beat Scotland on ITV and this summer’s humiliating capitulation to Iceland in Nice remained the most watched TV event of the year until the final of the Great British Bake Off proves that the half life of the national side’s once pre-eminent position in the national psyche remains long.And yet. For all that, international football has never felt less loved or lower down the agenda. Most of those traversing the Jubilee line or the Metropolitan line to Wembley Park are after a fairly cheap, decent night out at a modern stadium with their family or friends. The result, it seems, matters rather less than it used to.The atmosphere for a football match at Wembley increasingly feels interchangeable with that at any of the other mega-events it hosts, from pop concerts to NFL matches. The reasons are many and varied. The expanded size of the European Championship and the World Cup arguably makes these early qualification skirmishes even less exciting.Some of it is generational and recent underperformance must be a factor. If you are 60, you can just about recall 1966. If you are 40, Italia 90 and Euro 96 still loom large. If you are 15, then the best you can probably manage is a dim recollection of meek surrender in Bloemfontein.Is the unthinkable happening – are people finally switching the football off? | Owen Gibson Read moreParadoxically, given the number of kids at Wembley on good value family tickets, many younger fans feel more engaged with their chosen club side – be it Arsenal or Barcelona – or even individual players, than their country.But there is something wider at work too. An overload of televised football, the feeling that international football no longer represents the pinnacle of the sport and the sheer lack of quality on show must all contribute.Friendlies were the first to suffer from this creeping sense of ennui and it has now extended to the bloated qualifying process for major finals too. If Fifa follows through on plans to expand the World Cup to 48 nations, expect it to accelerate still further.Still, at a time when there is a similarly complex and knotty debate raging about whether the public appetite for football generally is falling amid a feeling of oversaturation, perhaps the international break is doing the Premier League and its broadcasting paymasters the ultimate favour by prompting a yearning for its return.TopicsEnglandSportblogFriendliesThe FAFootball politicscommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Comprehensive schools have improved our lives. The evidence that they are better for our children and for all of us is overwhelming. Which is why 60 organisations, including the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, put their names to an open letter in October pleading for the ban on new grammar schools to remain. Why, then, in the face of overwhelming expert advice, do so many members of the public, some ministers, and the prime minister want to press ahead with more selective schools?It is possible to select a subset of grammar schools and to suggest that the minority of children from poorer backgrounds who attend that small set do go on to get better GCSE results, but that does not provide evidence that the grammar school model is good in general. It also does not question the English orthodoxy that it is always better to get higher grades in exams. If all we needed was lots of people who were especially skilled at exam technique, it would be – but that is not what we lack as a country. We lack rounded adults with a wide range of skills who respect and understand each other’s abilities and contributions.Introducing a grammar school into an area does not only harm schooling in that immediate district but also in neighbouring areas. Despite this, more people are in favour of creating new grammar schools (38%) than would be in favour of ending selection in those that still exist (23%). Among those who attended grammar schools themselves, 61% would like to see more built. It’s the old who are most in favour of selection.The argument for grammar schools is similar to the argument for leaving the EU. It is about people wanting something better than they currently have, and believing that a return to the past will be an improvement and that “experts” are not to be believed. However it is also an argument against carrying on as we are, and against the rising inequality of recent decades that has resulted in selection by house price.Co-operative schools: the antidote to academies | Warwick Mansell Read moreThe majority of people in England do not want to defend 1970s comprehensive schooling, just as they don’t want to defend 1970s council housing, or having a health service treating elderly people as it did in the 1970s. People want something better than what is currently on offer. They are also not stupid enough to believe that their children will all pass the 11-plus – although unfortunately, a little like Americans voting for Trump, the rise in individualism in the UK has harmed our collective thinking.People do not want their child to have to attend a local comprehensive that is severely underfunded after years of cuts hidden behind the pretence of having “ringfenced education”. They do not want their children to be assigned to the school in which almost all the teachers are very young because staff turnover is so high, and in which few children have middle-class parents – the school which those “in the know” tend to avoid.People may also not want their precious child to be forced to attend an exam factory [pdf] in which every C and B that can be squeezed out of them will be squeezed out of them, in which not going to university is categorised as failure. It is not impossible that some parents (and probably more grandparents) see the return of grammar schools as an opportunity to have more secondary moderns for the bulk of children who are bored with being continually pushed along a tedious national curriculum, given so much homework, and treated as a “problem” for “the school”.Just like Brexit, the choice currently on the table is between “business as usual” or “change”. Business as usual is now a complex competing set of schools, many of which are now academies. Business as usual already includes selection at age 16 because academies can and do refuse to accept pupils who do not score high enough GCSE grades across a wide range of subjects.It is the market that decides what makes a child’s grades high enough for them to be able to stay in their academy at age 16. Children and their parents find out if they are winners on the day GCSE results are released. If their results are not good enough, they have just a few days to let the educational market in their town find alternative provision – unless their child was persuaded to jump earlier to a vocational “university” technical college at the age of 14, from which they are unlikely to go on to university.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Pupils at Haywood Academy, a co-operative secondary school. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the GuardianDifferent children need different challenges at different ages. Other countries understand this, but that does not mean having to be in very different schools from each other.What has not been put on the table is any alternative to business as usual that is not just a return to the past. Exactly the same mistake was made when the electorate was given a remain or leave choice over EU membership.The UK has historically made big changes to public service provision when it has been forced to do so. The NHS was introduced in 1948 partly because the middle class could no longer afford private doctors’ fees. Comprehensives were introduced across most of the country in the 70s partly because at a time of high economic equality the middle class could no longer afford to pay for private education if their children failed the 11-plus. We are facing another financial crisis today – not just as a result of a falling pound, but because of the long-term fallout of the 2008 financial crash.Selective education is inefficient and hence expensive. Academy schools and chains are also expensive, prone to concerns about corruption, and to the negative effects of short-term competition to increase grades. Children are served best in countries such as Finland where there is no equivalent of Ofsted, no league tables, and only a small random sample of pupils’ work is occasionally tested to monitor school (not pupil) performance.We are a long way from achieving anything like the success of the Finnish model of education, but how could we begin to move towards it, and could we do so while also saving money? I think we could.‘Why would a Tory object?’: crusader for grammar schools is having his moment Read moreBritish school senior management teams are large and expensive. Do two neighbouring schools really need two separate senior management teams or could one team do a better job, with the ability to move teachers and eventually pupils between sites? If we were to remove competition between neighbouring schools, we could begin to reduce the stigma built up over decades that surrounds some of our local schools. That stigma began to be significant only with the widespread publication of school league tables in the 90s. If the state schools in a small town were combined under one governing body, then only the town as a whole would be ranked. And when catchments began to become less meaningful, the housing price differentials across a town should fall.Eventually we should aim to fund our state schools as well as they are funded in Finland, per child, but that is a long-term aspiration. In the short term, unless we know what it is we want – new Finnish cooperation rather than old English competition – we stand little chance of getting there, and a good chance of moving back to the bad old days of selection.You might think such cooperation can never happen. However, there are already 800 co-operative schools in the UK. And they are beginning to organise regionally with more plans in place for 2017.The first comprehensive school was up and running long before the comprehensive movement became mainstream. The first co-operative schools are already here – now we need to explain again and again why cooperation trumps competition in education. Almost any fool can be taught to achieve an A* if enough resource is thrown at them. We need children who become adults who understand that there is so much more to learning than simply achieving grades in an exam.This article is a shortened version of the Caroline Benn Memorial Lecture, which Danny Dorling will give this eveningon 15 November at the House of Commons. The lecture is an annual event in memory of the comprehensive schools campaigner, who died in 2000.You’ve heard of supermarkets and funeral parlours, but what is a Co-op school?A co-operative school is a state school, primary or secondary, writes Susanna Rustin, that has partly or fully opted out of local authority control and turned itself into a co-operative, with members and a commitment to the values of the co‑operative movement.Co-operative schooling began in the north of England in the 1830s, as one of the projects of the movement’s early supporters, be formally designated a cooperative in recent times was Reddish Vale High in Stockport in 2008.There are now 811 co-operative schools, 139 of them secondaries. More than 700 of these are foundation trust schools, with co-operative values – self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity – written into the constitutions of the charitable trusts that own their land and assets. Some trusts control only one school, but more include a secondary and a group of feeder primaries, or a group of local primaries that want to work together, such as the Coastal Alliance foundation trust in Kent, formed earlier this year.Some of the first co-operative schools sought more autonomy than is granted by trust status, and in 2010 the Department for Education approved a co-operative model for converter academies, including a values clause in their articles of association. Today 74 co-operative schools are academies, and Carl Ward, the Stoke-on-Trent headteacher who chairs the Schools Co-operative Society, to which many of them belong, describes the past few years as a period of “immense growth”. Two Church of England primary schools have just joined the multi-academy trust he leads in Stoke, City Learning Trust, and become the first co-operative faith schools in the process.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Most people think of food rather than schools when they think of the Co-op. Photograph: Yui Mok/PAIt is tempting to view the whole co-operative schools project, as promoted in the first instance by the Co-operative College – a Manchester-based charity, and not a college – as a rebellion against the market-oriented education policies of the past 30 years. But, says Ward, “at its heart it’s not political, it’s probably cultural”.Back in 2008, David Cameron spoke with enthusiasm of creating a new generation of co-operative schools, and while some of the early foundation trusts were seen as a means of fending off academisation, there are now at least 12 co-operative multi-academy trusts – the government’s favoured model – running about 80 schools. One, the Co-operative Academies Trust with eight schools in the north of England, is sponsored by the Co-operative Group and shares its typeface with Co-op supermarkets and funeral directors.Meanwhile, “school improvement”, meaning raising standards measured in exam results and league tables, has moved to front and centre of what the Schools Co-operative Society does, with seven devolved regional organisations setting up their own school improvement teams.Of course, schools that are formally designated co-ops do not have a monopoly on the ideas co-op schools have embraced. Rachel Snape is headteacher at the Spinney school in Cambridge, and explains that although the school has stayed with the local authority, “I feel we’ve got values, cooperation is one of those, and solidarity and unity and collaboration are others.”Some question to what extent co-op schools really are co-ops. Steve Watson, a former maths teacher and now a Cambridge University lecturer, became interested in them because he thought they might support teachers’ professional development, one of his research areas. “Autonomy of schools tends to mean autonomy of headteachers,” he says. “Democratic member control – one member, one vote – is a co-operative principle, and could be a way for teachers to have a greater say in how they are run.” But he believes the central accountability demanded in the current system, and emphasis on targets and measurement, make such ideas difficult to implement: “My view is that the schools are more co-operative in name than in the fundamental value of workplace democracy.”Ward once met a headteacher in Italy who was elected by his staff, and agrees “we haven’t gone that far” in England. But he says he would have an open mind if he came across a proposal or pilot project, as “you have to be prepared to take risks to innovate”. He adds: “What most co-op schools try to do is treat their staff very fairly, and subscribe to levels of pay that unions agree on”.At present the government is trying to move towards a skills-based system of school governance, appointing accountants and other professionals – though the education secretary, Justine Greening, recently dropped a plan to remove altogether the right of parents to be represented on governing bodies. Ward believes the co-operative model, whereby pupils, staff, parents and the local community elect members of a forum that advises a school’s governing body, is the ideal compromise.What’s more, co-op schools should benefit from help and advice from other co-operative business, since co-ops are “honour-bound” to support each other.TopicsSchoolsGrammar schoolsSecondary schoolsSchool fundingAcademiesEducation policyfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content

Thank you.The big pictureIt won’t have escaped your attention that Donald Trump was elected US president last week, an event that will not be without consequences. The one that interests us is: what will it mean for the government’s Brexit strategy?The short answer is: nobody really knows. First, Trump seems happy to change his mind fairly often about most things, and it’s not clear how far we should interpret his campaign rhetoric as statement of firm policy intent.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Theresa May and Donald Trump. Composite: Getty/RexSecond, beyond “getting the best possible deal for Britain” the government doesn’t seem to have much of a Brexit strategy quite yet, and what it has, it isn’t telling us about. (According to a leaked memo, it has no single plan, is working on 500 Brexit projects, and may need 30,000 extra civil servants to deal with the workload.) That said, as my colleague Patrick Wintour suggested, two base scenarios present themselves – one a potential opportunity, the other a threat. The tricky thing is, Theresa May doesn’t have much time to decide which way it will play. Broadly, Trump – who raised doubts during his campaign about the US’s commitment to Nato – could be good news for May if the EU 27 become concerned about the geopolitical and security consequences, for example when dealing with Russian expansionism or the terrorist threat. In that case, Britain’s military strength and intelligence capabilities might look more valuable to the bloc, prompting it to make Brexit concessions. Eastern member states particularly worried by Russia, for example, may prove more flexible on Britain’s aim to curtail free movement.Crispin Blunt, chair of the parliament’s foreign affairs committee, put it this way: Within the negotiations on exit terms is going to be a negotiation on common security policy. It’s an obvious common interest that we should be fully engaged.But there are equally strong reasons why the EU may not roll over. It might feel that the risk from the anti-establishment forces that drove Brexit and Trump is so great that only a harsh Brexit will show the Eurosceptics likely to do well in next year’s Dutch, French and German elections that leaving the EU is a seriously bad idea.    Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Boris Johnson: Donald Trump’s election could be a ‘good thing’ for UK and EuropeTrade could go either way. It’s possible that Trump, as he has signalled, will sign up for a future US-UK trade deal – which could strengthen the UK’s negotiating hand. On the other hand, he has blamed free-trade deals for all America’s economic woes, and could be spoiling for a tariff war with China. If a Trump-led US, and subsequently the world, do take an inward-looking, protectionist turn, Britain could find itself quitting the EU’s single market and customs union and looking for favourable new trade deals at precisely the same moment as everyone else is shunning them. Diplomatically, things could fall between the same cracks. In this context, Britain’s early and enthusiastic welcome to Trump – compared, for example, with German chancellor Angela Merkel’s cautious and very conditional reception – is unlikely to go down well with an EU 27 deeply alarmed by the prospect of populist contagion.All of which prompted Ian Bond of the Centre for European Reform to offer the government this post-Trump Brexit advice: The UK should focus on leaving the EU with the minimum damage to its relations with its European partners. That argues for minimising its demands and trying to achieve a quick agreement … If the UK is not to take a big economic hit, it needs to stay inside the single market. It should not make cutting EU migration its top priority, and try to salvage what it can of its market access.Trump, the unexpected and unpredictable new leader of a country Britain has long considered its greatest ally, has changed the Brexit dynamics. Quite how, though, we will have to wait and see.The view from EuropeAmong a number of likely responses to the Republican’s unexpected triumph that could have an eventual impact on Brexit, the union is bent on bolstering its capacity to respond to conflicts and crises on its borders.Although it dialled back plans for an EU defence HQ, Federica Mogherini, the bloc’s foreign affairs chief, said the union is a “superpower” indispensable for world peace. Manfred Weber, the influential chairman of the conservative EPP group in the European parliament, struck a similar note:  Trump will force Europe to grow up … We must be able to defend ourselves, and do so quickly. He will strengthen the need to establish a European defence community – and the EU states will finally take responsibility.How the UK responds to this ambition could well prove critical to the goodwill – notably lacking, for the time being – that will be necessary on both sides for obtaining a Brexit deal that Britain can consider favourable. Bad news for leavers – the EU has bigger priorities than Brexit | Anand Menon Read moreBritain has in the past sworn to oppose anything resembling a “European army”, with the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, only last month sparking fury on the continent with his promise to veto any such move:  That is not going to happen. We are full members of the EU and we will go on resisting any attempt to set up a rival to Nato.Meanwhile, back in Westminster … Even with the Commons in recess last week, MPs and ministers were busy coping with the second seismic political shock of recent months – though they could at least take comfort in the knowledge that Trump’s win was not chaos of their own making.Back in their constituencies, all cast their minds back. Had they criticised Trump? Did it matter if they had? Should they start doing so if they hadn’t? How problematic does a president-elect need to be before the much-vaunted (in London, anyway) “special relationship” no longer applies?The provisional answer appears to be to metaphorically stick both fingers in your ears and pretend everything is normal – plus some displacement activity, mainly centred around Nigel Farage and busts of Churchill.Theresa May shrugged off the snub/compliment/random act of chance of being telephoned by Trump after a dozen other leaders. On Monday, the prime minister made a speech promising that the UK would “adapt to the moment” and take on the global mantle of a leader in free trade.Downing Street was dismissive of the idea that Farage and the rest of his delegation of self-styled “Brex Pistol” UK hangers-on could somehow be envoys from London to the new Washington, with even diehard Tory Brexit fans unimpressed. “This is an ego trip, not a diplomatic one,” noted Iain Duncan Smith of Farage in New York.Oh, and just before the Trump thing happened, the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, announced that should it come to it, his party would not vote in favour of triggering article 50 in parliament unless the government promised a second referendum on the terms of the exit deal.

Photograph: Euan Cherry/AvalonThis may not seem too much of an issue in the Commons, where the Lib Dems have just eight MPs, but in the Lords they have more than 100 peers – and any bill authorising article 50 will need to pass both houses. Brexit minister David Jones said Farron was seeking to subvert democracy. You should also know that:Government lawyers might argue in their supreme court appeal that the article 50 process could be reversed by parliament at any time, which some legal experts suggest could see the high court ruling – that MPs must be consulted before the exit process starts – overturned. May’s much-trumpeted visit to India was not an unmitigated triumph, with the prime minister’s desire for a post-Brexit trade deal apparently stymied by her unwillingness to accept more skilled Indian workers and students.The makers of Toblerone came under fire for widening the gaps between the chocolate bar’s triangles in an effort to avoid putting UK prices up in the wake of the pound’s fall since the referendum. The ratings agency Standard and Poor’s predicted a hard Brexit and a fresh downgrade for the UK, calling it a deeply divided, diminishing economic power on the verge of losing the right to export freely to the EU.Two-thirds of voters oppose a “blind date” Brexit with no certainty on terms.The pro-remain boss of Lloyd’s bank urged May to “get cracking” with Brexit, saying delays could prove damaging for business. The UK construction industry is at its weakest level for four years amid growing economic uncertainty following the referendum.A Luxembourg MEP has proposed a voluntary “associate EU citizenship” that could preserve some of Britons’ EU rights.Read this:In the Guardian, Tim Farron explains his controversial warning that his party will vote against triggering article 50 unless there is a second referendum once the Brexit terms are known: Since nobody has set out what Brexit would look like, and nobody – neither MPs nor the public – has had a say on what should come next, how is it undemocratic to demand that people should be given a say? ... We trusted people to vote for departure. Now we must also trust people to vote for a destination.Polly Toynbee calls Brexit and Trump’s victory signal a “whitelash” that politicians must absolutely not pander to and the left has to tackle head on: Demagogues seize on voters’ contradictions: people want Swedish public services on Trump-like low taxes; the cheap benefits of Primark and Lidl globalised trade, but to keep British jobs for British people. There are no magic solutions: not Brexit, not Trump. Labour needs to find the language to express these universal truths that most people know in their heart of hearts: you get what you pay for, and foreigners are not to blame for the failings of our shrinking state. In the New Statesman, Tom Nuttall, who writes the Economist’s Charlemagne column, recounts a voyage round a dozen European countries, most of them increasingly aghast at the turn Brexit is taking in the UK. But there is acknowledgment, too, that this is a crunch moment for the EU: Even Britain’s allies are starting to marvel at the daily horrors across the Channel. “The Tories are in the hands of nutcases,” a UK-friendly EU official told me after the Conservative party conference. “Poor Britannia.” The antics of the cabinet’s Three Brexiteers are monitored with morbid fascination … But what keeps Berlin up at night, a German official recently told me, is not the UK-EU relationship, but the question of whether European integration has run its course. “Everything else is peanuts,” he said.

Watching Othello once again in Sydney, my first thought is what a wonderful play it is. My second is what a sad mess the Bell Shakespeare Company has made of it.Othello remains the world’s greatest investigation into the age-old theme of jealousy: the “green-eyed monster” that spurs Iago, rejected for a promotion, to evil deeds; and Othello, horrified by his wife’s supposed adultery, to murder.Yet Othello touches on other subjects, too, as relevant today as they were in Elizabethan England. The lionisation of military strength. A cold, hard look at love, an emotion that isn’t always kind. Ugly misogyny in what remains a man’s world. Racism.Speed-the-Plow review – Rose Byrne let down by outdated sexism of Mamet’s biting satire Read moreWith such low-hanging fruit ripe for the picking, how did Bell’s new artistic director, Peter Evans – in charge of a national tour that kickstarted in Orange earlier this year and ends next month in Sydney – go so wrong?Indeed, reviews have been so bad that the Australian announced the “plug should be pulled”. “Nothing in this production becomes it like the leaving of it,” wrote Chris Boyd in July. “You have until December to miss it.”Months later, with the opportunity to raise their game squandered, I’d have to agree – but not because, as Boyd believes, Othello is an “unbearable play … 1600s torture porn, without redemption or relief”. On the contrary, what strikes me most, sitting in the plush surrounds of the Opera House, is Shakespeare’s ability to drill down into the core of nasty human behaviour. Most shocking in Othello is the Bard’s exposure of brutality inside the home.Four centuries ago, Shakespeare provided a reminder, as welcome now as it was then, that beatings and butchery happen not only among the poor and disadvantaged but also among the generals, the powerful, the rich, the glamorous. In Australia – a country still plagued by macho ideas of masculinity and domestic violence against women – that message remains painfully pertinent.It’s a tragedy, then, that in this version everything from the set to the costumes to the acting suffers from a crime far worse than being just plain bad: it is boring.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Ray Chong Nee and Elizabeth Nabben: awkward and wishy-washy. Photograph: Daniel BoudEvans updates the setting to a vague present tense, dressing his male cast in casual khaki military uniforms, the “strumpet” Bianca in a trashy red dress and Desdemona in a pair of hideous wide-legged cropped peach pants.There’s a pallid-green set, bare aside from a single plinth, that reeks of a stale corporate hotel banquet room. The actors, too, are beige. Yalin Ozucelik’s Iago riffs well off other characters but his sloppy monologues are unmemorable.A wishy-washy Desdemona (Elizabeth Nabben) is feeble rather than fiery and defiant, reflecting her limp, loose clothes. The worst crime is Othello (Ray Chong Nee) who starts with awkward straight-backed stiffness and descends into silliness. His wildly flinching arms, darting eyes and near mouth-frothing as he enacts the end of days for himself and his love are meant to hold gravitas. Instead, they are laughable.Evans took over the reigns from founder John Bell last year. Given that this is the second tragedy he has directed with less than stellar effects (Romeo and Juliet also had a lukewarm reception) raises the question: is the company still able to deliver?That matters when Bell Shakespeare has become a crucial way to introduce young Australians to the Bard. Since it was founded in 1990, the company has performed for more than 2.5m people. Each year its work reaches 80,000 students. It’s an important job. Yet the young are particularly susceptible to rejecting a playwright who needs considerable intellectual and emotional investment to reap rewards. No more so when faced with wearisome, oppressive, tedious productions. And who can blame them?Faith Healer review – Judy Davis directs Colin Friels in near-perfect production Read moreBell Shakespeare is likely still adjusting after significant change (stability might be helped by the news in March that the company is receiving $1m in government funding to secure a permanent home.) It’s too early to throw in the baton just yet.In 1991, the company’s debut production – another great tragedy, Hamlet – closed after just four shows because it was so abysmally bad. John Bell did not give up but went on to bring joy to millions. Let’s hope Evans, then, is just finding his feet and that Shakespeare will return to Australian stages as addictive, thrilling, traumatic and ravishing as it should be. • Othello is showing at the Sydney Opera House playhouse in Sydney until 4 DecemberTopicsTheatreOthelloblogpostsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
It’s not all about us.Brexit means Brexit. Theresa May has made it clear that it is she who will ultimately decide what that means. But the prime minister is deluding herself. And I’m not convinced that, despite the recent high court ruling, the House of Commons is about to shape our negotiating strategy. Our fate lies not only in the government’s hands, but also in those of our European partners.This is all down to the rules of the game. Forget article 50. The real issue is that the deal that the UK strikes with its partners about our future economic relations with the EU will require unanimous ratification, not by leaders meeting in the European council but, rather, by parliaments across the EU (of which, if you include those regions with voting rights, there are 38).Hate crime inquiry head warns against 'whipping up prejudice' in campaigns Read moreMany, if not most, of the other member states enjoy pretty healthy levels of trade with the UK. This provides an economic incentive for all parties to come to an amicable settlement that preserves these economic relations. Jobs are at stake on the continent too.Unfortunately, however, economic rationality does not always win the day when it comes to political decisions. Just as, for some in this country, the principle of restoring British sovereignty trumped issues of profit and loss, so too, for some of our partners, issues other than economic advantage might determine their reactions to Brexit.In an attempt to understand continental attitudes to Brexit for a BBC Radio 4 programme to be aired this evening, I took a short trip and talked to politicians in four member states – the Netherlands, France, Germany and the Czech Republic – where elections are due next year. Not a representative sample, certainly, but enough to give an impression of the incentives that might shape the Brexit negotiations to come.It should come as no surprise that one person celebrating the referendum outcome was an MEP from France’s Front National. Having described how he had popped open the champagne on 24 June, however, he quickly added that his party’s glee would work against May.The challenges May’s plan will face include France’s centre-left and centre-right politicians having no interest in allowing Britain an exit deal that strengthens Marine Le Pen. And their desire to send a political message is shared by centrist politicians in the Netherlands, nervously tracking the electoral prospects of their own populist firebrand, Geert Wilders. The Dutch traditionally may have been a close and reliable ally of ours in the EU, but politics is politics, and an attractive Brexit deal is not in the political interest of the governing party.For politicians in the Czech Republic, it is the threat to their countrymen rather than to the political centre that preoccupies the political class. Reports of increased levels of violence and abuse towards eastern Europeans were given prominence in the domestic press, and political leaders have been quick to promise to do all in their power to address the issue.And it is against this background that they will approach negotiations with a British government keen to secure as much trade with the EU as possible, while controlling migration into the UK. And here, the Czechs draw a line. Freedom of movement is one of the key attractions of EU membership for the people of central and eastern Europe. Diluting the principle to help London is, to say the least, not a high priority in Prague at the moment.Which brings us to Germany. The high volume of trade that Germans enjoy with Britain has convinced many in this country that Angela Merkel would not be willing to impose economic pain on her country by insisting on a Brexit deal that imposed barriers to commerce. Surely, so the argument goes, the big German manufacturers will lobby hard to preserve access to a key market?But to think this is to mistake the mood in Berlin. A senior official from a prominent employers’ association told me ruefully that his members were already suffering ill effects from Brexit. However, frantic efforts to persuade the German government to limit this pain were proving fruitless.An MP from the governing CDU explained why. As far as Germany’s government is concerned, the challenge of Brexit is akin to that of dealing with Russia after its invasion of Crimea. Then too business leaders warned of economic pain if sanctions were imposed on Moscow. But the government held the political imperative to be more important than the economic calculation. This, he added with someone finality, would prove to be the case in negotiations with London as well.EU ministers to discuss plan to charge Britons to visit Europe after Brexit Read moreAnd it is not just in Berlin that politics will trump economics. The Dutch equivalent of the Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted a loss in the region of €10bn over the next 15 years in the event of a “hard Brexit”. The Dutch government is simply incorporating the figure into its economic planning. My Front National friend explained, with some bitterness, that the French elite was willing to risk French jobs to protect the EU and undermine the prospects of his party in next year’s election.For all the differences in their domestic political situations, our partners are, for the moment at least, united when it comes to the Brexit negotiations. And this is seen most clearly in their hostility to the idea that the UK should be allowed to benefit from the single market while restricting freedom of movement.This is not borne out of any desire to punish us. Everyone I spoke to was genuinely sad that we have voted to leave. But ultimately they all acknowledge that their own interests, whether they be domestic politics, or in ensuring the stability of the EU, take precedence over their friendship with us.Of course, there is a long way to go until the negotiations start, let alone finish. And politics, especially contemporary politics, has a habit of surprising us. Nothing about Brexit is preordained. But, from where we stand now, we don’t just need a post-Brexit plan, we need to overcome the attitudes of our partners, or it is likely to be an economically painful ride.• Analysis, Brexit: What Europe Wants, will be on Radio 4 this evening at 8.30pmTopicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionForeign policyFranceEuropeNetherlandscommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
The Obamas had an impact on fashion. What effect will the Trump presidency have on the fashion industry?Carrie, by emailHello, readers.I’m writing this from under my bed, where I’ve been wearing my pantsuit for seven days straight now. I have drunk all the alcohol in the house so have since moved on to cleaning fluids. I’m seeing spots, which is what I hoped for because I think we’ve all had quite enough of reality this week. Washing-up liquid is my tipple of choice now, folks.Maybe you’ve turned to this article to get a break from all the election coverage. Light relief, perhaps, or maybe just a change of tune. And I want to oblige you, I really do. But it’s hard to be all business-as-usual – making jokes like, “Ha ha, hotpants are stupid,” and “OMG did you see what Beyoncé wore this week?” (that’s usually what happens here, right?) – when you’re starting to eye up the oven cleaner as a chaser.Come on, Freeman. You’re a professional. You covered the hell that is Milan menswear fashion weeks four years running – you can handle this. So what can we say about the Trump era – [gags on own tongue] – from a fashion perspective? Barack and Michelle Obama did affect fashion. In fact, Michelle is on the cover of US Vogue this month – again – looking so gorgeous you wonder how any models get jobs these days.Their popularity among fashion folk is because the Obamas are genuinely – and I’m going to use a technical term here so have a dictionary ready – hot as hell. This demographic – “coastal elites”, as I believe they are called nowadays – genuinely liked them, and that made it even easier to hold them up as fashion icons.Which brings us to the Trumps. Now, I appreciate we should all be approaching this presidency with an open mind and hopeful heart and yadda yadda yadda. But I think it’s a pretty safe bet that Anna Wintour won’t be inviting Mr and Mrs Trump to grace the pages of her magazine with quite the same joy in her heart as she did with the Obamas. I’m sure Trump supporters – and doubtless Trump himself – will put this down to “elitism” and “snobbery”, and that’s a fair point, of course, given Vogue’s well-known prejudice against Manhattan billionaires. And yet, despite that, Vogue has been a friend of the Trump family for decades, as is inevitable given that Wintour and Trump were both major figures in 80s New York so probably waved at each other across the Four Seasons every other day for the past three decades. Ivanka, Trump’s adored (a little too adored for the comfort of some of us) daughter, has been featured in gushing fashion magazine articles for years. And yet, somehow I don’t think that’s going to happen any more. It’s hard to present a young woman as the paragon of modern day feminism – she has babies … and works! And gets a daily blow dry! HOW DOES SHE DO IT!?!? – when her father is on tape talking about his fondness for giving women surprise manual smear tests.It’s almost poetic, really: all his life Trump just wanted respect, and his urge to run was almost certainly lit when Obama publicly mocked him at the 2011 White House Correspondents’ Dinner. And he won! But at the cost of ever him or his family ever having any respect from precisely the kind of people he always wanted it from. Is this an O Henry short story or a Dilbert cartoon strip? So in terms of their affect on high fashion, no, I don’t think the Trumps will have much of an impact. Is this elitism or just fashion people not feeling especially fond of a politician who won by employing blatantly misogynistic and racist rhetoric? Because of all the things you can criticise the fashion industry for, it does, at least, employ a lot of women and gay men. So it tends to have a pretty liberal bent, and you can call that elitism if you like, but it looks more like people simply following their beliefs to me. I say potato, you say grab ’em by the pussy. Pass the oven cleaner.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Taylor Swift … why the reticence? Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PAAs we know, politics are decided by celebrities these days. Which celebrities failed us this time?Nadia, by email Look, I have no appetite for the blame game. What’s the point? We will never have a woman president because a short-fingered vulgarian is about to destroy the world. But! I will make an exception when it comes to blaming celebrities and TAYLOR SWIFT I AM LOOKING AT YOU.As we all know now, white women without college degrees voted for Trump. But you know who white women listen to? That’s right – Taylor Swift. Swift remained intriguingly silent during the campaign, which seemed odd, considering her much-vaunted best friend, Lena Dunham, was anything but. Even Swift’s eventual, and very last-minute, admission that she was voting for Clinton was made through the medium of a polo neck (it’s an Instagram thing) rather than a full-throated endorsement.So why the reticence, Tay-Tay? Maybe she feared alienating her country-and-western base. Maybe her well-known loathing for Katy Perry, who has long been a Clinton supporter, trumped her politics. Maybe she’s just a big coward. Who knows? But you know what, Taylor? Making music videos with Victoria’s Secret models about how much you love female solidarity means sod all if you can’t even be bothered to speak up for a woman running against a raging misogynist.

In 2010, Elton John surprised his fans by releasing an album in collaboration with the pianist, singer and songwriter Leon Russell, whom he described as “my biggest influence”. Russell had been out of the limelight for three decades, but in the early 1970s he had been at the heart of some of pop music’s biggest events. He led and organised the touring ensemble Mad Dogs and Englishmen, headlined by the soul singer Joe Cocker. Then, he was featured at the Concert for Bangladesh, set up by George Harrison and others to raise funds for the victims of severe flooding.In his trademark top hat with stars and stripes decoration and with flowing hair and long straggly beard, Russell performed a medley of the Coasters’ Young Blood and the Rolling Stones’ Jumpin’ Jack Flash, in what Rolling Stone magazine called his “driving, lurchy, churchy” style.Russell, who has died aged 74, first made his mark as a songwriter by co-writing, with Bonnie Bramlett, Delta Lady for Cocker. He subsequently supplied The Carpenters with their 1971 hit Superstar, and George Benson with This Masquerade, a Grammy winner in 1977. Russell’s most widely recorded composition is A Song for You, of which there are more than 40 versions, by singers as varied as Andy Williams, Whitney Houston and Willie Nelson. Prior to these achievements, Russell had excelled as a studio musician in Los Angeles, as a member of the Wrecking Crew, a team of versatile instrumentalists who added lustre to hit records by the Ronettes, the Byrds and many others.He was born Claude Bridges, in Lawton, Oklahoma. He began piano lessons at the age of four and played the trumpet at high school. At 17, his band, the Starlighters, were appearing in Tulsa clubs when he was presented with a stark choice: study for entrance exams to university or go on the road in support of Jerry Lee Lewis. The group went on tour, following which the renamed Leon Russell decided to try his luck in Los Angeles.He found work in nightclubs and was soon in demand as a pianist for recording sessions. Russell found himself working alongside such figures as the guitarist Glen Campbell and the drummer Hal Blaine. Among the tracks on which he can be heard is the Ronettes’ Be My Baby, produced by Phil Spector, Mr Tambourine Man by the Byrds, California Girls by the Beach Boys and A Taste of Honey by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.Russell took the role of arranger on This Diamond Ring by Gary Lewis and the Playboys and Feelin’ Groovy by Harpers Bizarre. In 1968 he struck out on his own, building a studio at his home in the Hollywood Hills. There he worked with the guitarist Marc Benno on an album released as the Asylum Choir.Next he worked on Cocker’s eponymous album, released in November 1969, and set up Shelter Records with Cocker’s manager and producer Denny Cordell. When Cocker’s backing group disbanded, Russell took charge of rehearsals for a 68-concert American tour in 1970 using a 10-piece band and the same number of singers.“We all lived at Leon’s house,” Cocker recalled. “We ran round in the nude and had some pretty wild times. Leon was into this revivalist thing. Before a meal he would say a little prayer.” According to Russell, Mad Dogs and Englishmen was designed as a mobile commune of musicians, friends and family members.The tour was a great success, spawning a film documentary and earning Russell an invitation to join the star-studded line-up of the 1971 Bangladesh events. In the same year he recorded with Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and the Rolling Stones. Proof of Russell’s promotion to the pop world’s A list came when numerous superstars including ex-Beatles and Rolling Stones members made guest appearances on his 1970 debut, self-titled, solo album.Russell was now at the height of his popularity in live performance and on record. Carney (1972) reached No 2 in the US album charts and the following year Leon Live, a triple-album recorded in front of a 70,000 crowd at Long Beach Arena in California peaked at No 10.By the end of the decade, Russell had also turned his attention to country music. Using the pseudonym Hank Wilson, he had recorded the first of four albums of classic country songs in 1973 and became a regular guest at Nelson’s annual music “picnics”, collaborating with Nelson on the album One for the Road (1979).By then, he had returned to Tulsa and in the 1980s he established a pattern of issuing low-key records of his own compositions and touring sporadically. This continued until 2009 when Elton John persuaded him to make the album The Union. A film documenting this process was directed by Cameron Crowe. The renewed interest in Russell’s career triggered his election to both the Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters’ Hall of Fame in 2011.Russell’s first marriage, to the singer Mary McCreary, who duetted with him on The Wedding Album in 1976, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Janet Lee Constantine, and their children, Sugaree, Honey and Coco; by two children, Teddy Jack and Tina Rose, from his first marriage; and by a daughter, Blue, from a previous relationship with Carla McHenry.• Leon Russell (Claude Russell Bridges) musician and songwriter, born 2 April 1942; died 13 November 2016TopicsPop and rockCountryElton JohnOklahomaWillie NelsonobituariesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
With the arrival of the current generation of virtual reality, much of the battle for hardware supremacy has focused on one seemingly esoteric factor: the trade-off between image resolution and frame-rate.It may seem like a curiously technical point on which to define a consumer product war, but with VR, how a game is displayed isn’t just a matter of aesthetics; it can severely impact user comfort, and even function. In designing their respective headsets, the teams behind Oculus’ Rift and HTC’s Vive opted to offer high display resolution. Each headset sports a 2160 x 1200 overall output, comfortably trumping PlayStation VR’s 1920 x 1080 fidelity.So why did Sony choose to make sacrifices in image quality? One factor, it appears, is that PSVR has forgone peak resolution so as prioritise running at an impressive 120 frames-per-second (FPS), capably beating the 90FPS offered by HTC and Oculus. Technically, some content for Sony’s headset is bumped from 60FPS to the full 120FPS via an approach named reprojection, but the point stands. PSVR sacrifices resolution in favour of more comfortable movement.That potential for fluidity means a less jarring experience as you spin your head when inside a virtual realm, which in turn serves VR’s ultimate offering: presence. This is the most striking element of a quality virtual reality experience; the sense that you really occupy the world you are visiting. But as potent as that sensation can be, with a stutter of the screen image the illusion can come crashing down.The PlayStation 4 Pro – which already offers several advantages away from VR – hopes to bolster Sony’s position on this arcane frontline. With a faster CPU and more powerful graphics processing than the standard PS4, it promises to augment the capabilities of the PlayStation VR hardware. We set out to see just how noticeable this is.4K VR?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Until Dawn: Rush of Blood Photograph: SonyThe boost the PS4 Pro provides to PSVR slightly adjusts the frame-rate/resolution trade-off, potentially bettering both image and movement quality. Any improvement, however, is strictly limited by the existing PSVR hardware, which is locked at the aforementioned 1920 x 1080 resolution. In other words, whatever technical powerhouse you plug into Sony’s headset, the screen is the size it is. It is not 4K and does not support HDR; two front-of-the-box features on which the PS4 Pro is being sold to traditional flat display users.However, the upgraded PlayStation does promise to improve frame-rate smoothness and consistency for VR, which should further remove judder and blur from any virtual reality game optimised for the Pro. That is an important note. Many future PSVR releases will come ‘Pro-ready’, while numerous existing titles have already been prepared for the machine via an update.The key question, then, is what real difference does this all make to those games? Without considering motion, a given Pro-optimised PSVR game typically looks only delicately improved by the more powerful PS4. Across the spread of smaller experiences in Sony’s own VR Worlds, there appears to be a little more graphical finesse via a Pro, while in the more complex Until Dawn: Rush of Blood or Driveclub VR, there is more discernible improvement in detail and texturing. The tangle of neon-slash wireframes within Res Infinite’s VR mode, meanwhile, do look as if they are a touch more vibrant and present.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Robinson: The Journey is one of the first PlayStation VR to be optimised out of the box for PS4 Pro Photograph: CrytekAnd then there’s Robinson, Crytek’s tale of being stranded alone on a dinosaur-riddled island. ‘Pro from day-one’, Robinson is perhaps the best-looking PSVR game yet, regardless of the console version powering it. But bolstered by Pro, detail at distance is notably improved, in tandem with support for the enhanced SSDO/SSAO lighting effects exposing that visual quality. Add in higher quality texture filtering and more seamless level of detail (LOD) generation, and while the difference is neither striking nor game-changing, Robinson is definitely a prettier game when played through a Pro.However, all Pro-ready titles tested still carry a resolution somewhat lower than scene of a typical HD flat display, thanks to PSVR’s ‘per eye’ resolution of 960 x 1080, so visually, the upgraded console remains fundamentally comparable to that enjoyed on a vanilla PS4. But there’s something else to consider.Motionally charged?      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Even sedate experiences such as Tumble VR get a subtle but noticeable benefit from PS4 Pro Photograph: SonyStart to move around a little more and a few more benefits materialise. Most importantly, there is less motion blurring. A sharp flick of the head from left to right reveals that even rapid movements are greeted with slightly crisper, steadier images, all of which makes things more convincing, and more immersive. The improvement is subtle, but the impact is more significant – it can make all the difference between a comfortable experience and a nausea-inducing nightmare. Even in low-movement titles, like the understated block stacking puzzler Tumble, that improvement can be felt, and for more energetic experiences like online shooter RIGS: Mechanized Combat League or VR Worlds’ Scavengers Odyssey, things do feel a touch more fluid. Again, the improvement isn’t wild or outstanding, but something feels different.Res Infinite is very comfortable with the intensity setting pushed to its upper limit via a PS4 Pro, and back in the front seat of Driveclub VR the experience does feel just a shade more comfortable and less demanding of the senses. But then Driveclub VR was always a comfortable game.Robinson, meanwhile, has a few too many moments that trigger motion sickness on a standard PlayStation 4 – and alas, over on the Pro, it’s the same story, despite all the improvements to level of detail generation and texture filtering. That alone highlights an oft forgotten point when considering the quality and usability of a VR experience: arguably the onus is on the content, not the platform.There’s more good news, though. Broadly, loading times have been cut a good deal, which also limits how much texture pop-in blights games – another factor that can significantly impact a sense of presence. And while it is a small detail, the extra USB port on the Pro’s rear does make the PSVR’s abundant wiring a tidier business, leaving an extra port free at the front for controller charging; an important consideration when juggling the power levels of Move controllers as well as DualShock 4s.The VR verdictUltimately, The PlayStation 4 Pro does make a difference to PSVR games, but for now, it is subtle, and the true potential may only emerge with time as more and more titles hip with Pro-native features. If you are particularly prone to simulation or motion sickness, getting a Pro now may just make a positive difference to your VR experience.For those beguiled by even the most delicate improvements to graphically fidelity, meanwhile, there should be some appeal. And if you are already set to gain from the non-VR perks the Pro offers, then the fact that you’ll also have access to the best version of one of the most comfortable, accessible high-end VR experiences could make it very worth your while.TopicsGamesPlaystationPlayStation 4SonyVirtual realityfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
I have spent 42 years pushing against a patriarchy that tries to tell me what to look like, what to feel, who to demur to, and that there are many things that I can’t do because I’m female. The weaker sex? I gave birth. I wouldn’t be balled up on the ground if kicked in the groin. It’s tiring and it takes a toll. And I’ll keep pushing in my own steady way. For Thomas Frank (Trump has taken the White House – and he has the liberals to thank, 10 November) to leave sexism out of his response piece wholesale (not one mention) and to choose to use the word “shrill” toward the end of his article, a word which conjures up images of women (when has a man ever been called shrill?), leaves me frustrated and tired. Frank, whom I’m sure is a wonderful person in many respects, is as sexist as the next and hasn’t faced his own inner demons.Whether or not you think Hillary Clinton had the best interest of the lower class and working middle class in mind, for Frank to say that she isn’t really competent, that her email server was a real issue and that Biden would have been a better choice is just a cloak for his inability to face himself in the mirror.To his credit, or to the detriment of at least of half of us, Frank is not alone in his unacknowledged sexism. Even when we pit a woman against the least competent candidate we could imagine, for arguably the most important job there is, our society as a whole can’t stomach voting for her. Voters literally stayed home from the polls rather than elect a woman. Let’s throw this Frank article in the virtual trash where it belongs, and instead read response articles penned by feminists (of all genders). We have work to do.India ViolaMadison, Wisconsin, USA• Amid the negativity and strong words about the result of the presidential election, it is important that we stay positive and true to our morals and standards, unlike Donald Trump. As a young woman, feminist and member of the younger generation, I can certainly say that I will not tolerate Trump’s revolting words against women and those who don’t fit his mould of a perfect citizen. From this, I am reminded of the standards of how men should behave towards women: with respect and compassion.The doom-and-gloom events of this year have taught and emphasised to me the importance of staying positive and not letting morals and standards slip because of the behaviour of a leader such as Trump. Furthermore, Hillary Clinton has shown, particularly to women and girls, that anything is possible if you truly believe, and that women can be and are champions for this. As she said in her speech, “there is still much work to be done” and the only way we will aid the work ahead is if we stand together with positive energy and hope against people like Trump’s fear and discrimination.Eleanor SutcliffeCambridge• In an otherwise searching article (Report, 12 November) Sarah Churchwell falls prey to the same negativism in attitudes toward women politicians that she’s writing about. While it is true that “a staggering 53% of white women voted against Clinton,” it is not true that “once again, a female candidate did not carry even the female vote”. Some 54% of women voted for Clinton – not all white, but all women.Marcia SaundersLondon• Is it possible that we (who are appalled by his election) have underestimated Donald Trump? Is it possible that the rage, racism, boasts, unpleasant vilification of Hillary Clinton and ludicrous promises were his carefully calculated pose to woo those voters he recognised as disillusioned with the Washington establishment and longing for change? That the wall was never going to be built; that the secretary of state was never going to be sent to jail; that the clampdown on Muslim communities could be quietly overlooked; that Nato would survive and trade treaties would remain untorn.He is where he wants to be. He will have real power. He will use it to get what he really wants. He is a wheeler-dealer, a negotiator. He knows how to choose and use talented people who can deliver his goals. Let us by all means be fearful of what those goals might be, but let us also look beyond the smokescreen of his performance in the campaign. Listen to the change of tone of his carefully emollient victory speech. Remember how he outmanoeuvred the other contenders and shrugged off the disdain of the Republican hierarchy. Let us hope that American liberals will not write him off as a fool who cannot possibly survive.Chris HarrisLymington, Hampshire• It is interesting to reflect that while all recent US presidents (even George W Bush) have made very public professions of attachment to the Christian faith, Donald Trump does not appear to share this. None of his frequent utterances over the last year have alluded to faith, and his actions and words during the election campaign were hardly those of a Christian adherent, quite the opposite. So we may reasonably assume that the Tea Party religious right, a key influence in his election, is now headed up by an amoral infidel. That would be one of the weirder outcomes of 8 November.Robin WendtChester• How come liberals encourage violence while exercising their freedom of speech (Report, 12 November)? This is something I’ll never understand. You always speak of love and understanding when making conservatives knuckle under to your beliefs, yet when you don’t get your way after a fair election you unhinge like a crazed three-year old. Filth, property damage, foul language and disrespect for the individual and country. This is a liberal who loses. Your hypocrisy is staggering.Kimberly BrockwayRandom Lake, Wisconsin, USA• The protesters in American cities all appear to be in the twenties. This is the generation, particularly if they are college-educated, who have been brought up on the shibboleths of political correctness, safe spaces and cultural appropriation, while being protected from viewpoints and literature running counter to their sensibilities. All of these are bound to trump democracy. They must be shell-shocked.Edward ThomasEastbourne• At a time of great uncertainty and anxiety following the election of Donald Trump, we should seek inspiration from the recent past. The “You say you want a revolution?” exhibition currently at the V&A museum charts the exhilarating optimism of the late 1960s, when millions of people tried to create a better world through music, fashion and positive social change and everything seemed possible. We must work to restore that spirit of hope.Stan LabovitchWindsor• To all those who claimed (re Jeremy Corbyn) that attracting large, enthusiastic crowds was meaningless because it wouldn’t translate into votes… guess what?Bruce PaleyHaverfordwest, Pembrokeshire• Will there now be a rush of American babies named Donald or, even worse, Donalda as a result of Donald Trump’s victory?Margaret GarlandSaffron Walden, Essex• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/lettersTopicsUS elections 2016Hillary ClintonDonald TrumpDemocratsRepublicansUS politicslettersShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Legendary Paris rock venue, the Bataclan, has reopened with an emotional gig by the British singer Sting, a year after jihadi gunmen burst in and killed 90 people during a series of terrorist attacks in the French capital. The former Police frontman, 65, appeared on stage to cheers as hundreds of concert-goers including families of the victims and survivors, crowded together struggling to comprehend how gunmen could have burst into the venue – now completely refurbished to cover up its lasting scars, including a new stage and red velvet curtains – and opened fire on music fans in one of the most brutal attacks on French soil since the second world war.Sting told the crowd in French: “We’ve got two important things to do tonight … First, to remember and honour those who lost their lives in the attacks a year ago. And then to celebrate the life and the music of this historic venue.”He added: “We shall not forget them,” before holding a minute’s silence on stage.Sting opened his set with a gentle version of one of his later hits, Fragile, which captured the cautious apprehension and sadness in the crowd, but as he launched into a noisier, raucous rendition of the Police hit Message in a Bottle, the audience began to trust him to lead the Bataclan through what felt like a vital and inescapable return to rock’n’roll, but which was no less raw and painful. In the audience were many parents and relatives of the 90 people who were killed last November when watching Californian rock band the Eagles of Death Metal.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   People wait outside the Bataclan before it reopens. Photograph: Pierre Suu/Getty ImagesAs Sting gave an emotional rendition of the Police hit Every Breath You Take, one bereaved mother in a balcony seat took out a framed holiday photo of her son in his 20s who was killed during the massacre and held it on her lap facing the stage, as if ensuring he was watching the gig. Other parents wiped away tears.Some of the songs which Sting sang were written before many of the Bataclan victims were born but they had a resonance with the parents, some of whom were carrying flowers, who were resolved to enjoy the gig to the full as a memorial to their children’s love of live music.“The last time I played the Bataclan, it was 1979,” Sting told the crowd. “I had written a song in Paris in 1978 and here it is…” he said before belting out Roxanne as many of the parents clapped and cheered.The French-Lebanese trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf was applauded as he joined Sting on stage for several solos.Aurelien, 25, who survived the Bataclan massacre while his friend was killed, said it was the first time he had been to a public place since the shooting, as he had avoided cinemas, bars and gatherings.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   People gather around flowers and candles laid next to the Bataclan to mark the anniversary of the attack. Photograph: Francois Guillot/AFP/Getty Images“I’m here because it’s important to finally finish a concert that was never allowed to end,” he said. “It’s for the memory of my friend and for all the 90 people who died.”He added: “I came alone tonight. It’s very emotional, as I keep getting flashbacks of that night. I was standing just there, just the other side of the bar when it happened. Tonight is the first time I’ve been back here since.” Another survivor, Mariesha Jack Payne, waited across the road from the Bataclan in the Barometer bar, where she had been rushed to after the attack. She travelled from Scotland for the commemorations in Paris this weekend. “Even if I’m not inside, it’s symbolic for me to be here nearby,” she said. But two members of the Eagles of Death Metal were turned away from the reopening gig by the venue’s co-director. This followed a falling-out after the band’s singer Jesse Hughes told US TV earlier this year he had suspicions the attack was prepared with help from inside and cast suspicions on the security guards.One of the Bataclan’s managers, Jules Frutos, told AFP: “They came, I threw them out, there are things you can’t forgive.”Sting closed his set sitting alone on stage with an acoustic guitar, performing a song he had written in memory of James Foley, the journalist killed by Islamic State in Syria in 2014. He told the audience that the song was “for everyone who has lost someone”. The lyrics included the line: “Keep my place and the empty chair, somehow I’ll be there.”TopicsParis attacksFranceEuropeParisStingnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Set your alarm clock. On 20 January 2017, Donald Trump will take up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the most stunning real-estate acquisition in the history of the modern world. In the time of transition between then and now, the apprentice president will be taught how to use the nuclear codes. He will also participate in a simulated crisis, a war game designed to better his understanding of how the White House deals with the unexpected.For a trumpfounded world, as for many in his own country, his election is the Black Swan event of a generation. A serial bankrupt will be at the wheel of the world’s largest economy. A man with no experience of elected office will preside over a government machine with 2.8 million civilian employees and 1.5 million military personnel. A man who will be pursued into the White House by a pack of lawsuits will be in charge of the FBI. A man repeatedly described as unfit for the office by senior members of his own party will be the commander-in-chief with his finger on the trigger of more than 4,000 nuclear warheads. A man who knows little about the rest of the world will become the most powerful person on the planet. Two-thirds of Americans told pollsters that he lacks the temperament to be president, but he is going to be put in the high seat anyway.One way to deal with a shock of such magnitude is to try to reduce it to more digestible proportions by telling yourself that it will not be as terrible as first feared. This is how some of the humiliated political establishment in the US are trying to cope with their nightmare. Some here and elsewhere in Europe are also trying to process their horror by telling themselves that he can be controlled. They endeavour to normalise the idea of President Trump by telling us that a man who bid for power by trampling over democratic norms will be constrained by the traditional boundaries once he has office. On this comforting account of the future, the Terrifying Trump of the campaign trail will morph into Tamed Trump. The most optimistic types even conjecture that he might evolve into a version of Ronald Reagan, highly scary to much of the planet when first elected, but a president who ultimately ushered the world towards a peaceful conclusion to the cold war.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  What will be the first actions Trump takes as president?Well, being an optimist by disposition, I would like to think that the rosy view is correct, because if he unleashes a fraction of the things he has threatened, he will be calamitous for America and the planet. But there are multiple grounds for scepticism about the sanguine view of President Trump. To believe he will turn into some sort of benign figure repeats the mistake constantly made as he marched on power. Some of those saying that he will be caged by office are the same people who said that no candidate could ever secure the White House by disparaging and demonising so many segments of the electorate. Yet get there he has. Orthodoxy contended that no candidate could prevail by trampling on so many democratic norms, among them threatening to lock up his opponent if he won and refusing to concede defeat if he lost. Yet prevail he did. Having secured the White House by shredding so many conventions, it takes one hell of a leap of faith to believe that he will now be controlled by the traditional rules.Donald Trump wins presidential election, plunging US into uncertain future Read moreAnother reason to be doubtful of the Tamed Trump thesis is the nature of his mandate. He has made the ritual noises of conciliation that follow every election by saying he will seek to govern for “all Americans”, but those hoary cliches sound especially empty coming from his lips. He did not gain ascendancy on a promise of unity and compromise, but by running on a platform of resentment, rage and bigotry. He was the most polarising presidential candidate of my lifetime.He is already an epically divisive president before he has even take the inaugural oath. This will be compounded because the “Trump triumph” is a building without concrete foundations. He lost the popular vote, only gaining the White House thanks to the eccentricities of the American electoral system. Just one in four Americans voted to put him there, which is worth bearing in mind whenever you hear anyone calling this a “revolution” or a “popular insurgency”.What Teddy Roosevelt dubbed “the bully pulpit” of the presidency can give its holder enormous sway over the emotions of that nation. At times of crisis, a president can cool passions or inflame them, stoke divisions or try to bridge them. I think we already have clues aplenty about what President Trump will do with the bully pulpit. There are compelling reasons to be fearful about how a man of his temperament will respond when he fails to make good on his many undeliverable promises. His impulse will be to try to displace the blame by unleashing the demagogic furies against minorities and foreigners. His election presents the most serious challenge to the international order that has prevailed since 1945Some of his more prominent supporters have been telling the world that it can relax because his wilder statements and more outlandish pledges were not meant to be taken seriously. It was just “campaign shtick”, a comic routine. You know he is a liar; take comfort in that. He has indeed flipped and flopped over a host of issues, but on some themes he has been as constant as the northern star. He lies a lot, but he does not lie all the time. There are critical policy areas in which he should be taken both literally and seriously. He is an economic nationalist. He has been clear and consistent about that and over many years. When he told America that it had been “raped” by cheap imports from China, he believed it – and so did his voters. That was key to his victories in the rust belt states in the midwest.Some Brexiters are getting excited by the idea that he will fast-track a sweetheart trade deal for Britain. They should have a cold shower. A Trump presidency will not be friendly to the free trade on which so much of global prosperity now depends. There is a real and serious danger of a slide into protectionism or, worse, a full-scale tariff war of the sort that was so ruinous in the 1930s. Believe him when he says he will put “America first”. He may have stolen the slogan from previous iterations of American nativism and isolationism, but he has made it his own and made it resonant with voters weary of foreign entanglements, foreign workers and foreigners in general. His election presents the most serious challenge to the international order that has prevailed since 1945. “The leader of the free world” has often played the role imperfectly, but the lazy assumption of the rest of the world’s democracies, especially those in Europe, has been that it could always be relied on to be there. We now see how complacent that was.He is not the first American to say that its allies have been freeloading. Europeans have for too long relied on the US to be the guarantor of their security without asking themselves how long an increasingly resentful America would be willing to pick up a disproportionate amount of the bill. What is scarily novel about him is that he is the first incoming American president to have declared, in language noted in Moscow and Beijing, that his commitment to Nato and the security pacts with Japan and South Korea is ambiguous.President Trump will be an especially bracing experience for a Britain that is already in the processing of severing itself from its other historic alliance with the EU. Successive British prime ministers have flattered themselves and their citizens with the idea that this country has a unique bond with the US that awards it privileged access to the Oval Office and amplified influence on the world stage. Any signs to the contrary have been a cause of alarm. When Barack Obama was elected president, it was reported as a great slight that he had a longer first phone call with Nicolas Sarkozy, then the French president, than he did with Gordon Brown. Theresa May was put on hold until Donald Trump had talked to nine other leaders before she finally got to exchange banalities about “the special relationship”. Downing Street has no links to the next American president or his inner circle. Neither does anyone else in Europe.British ministers are deriving comfort from the idea that he is essentially a deal-maker, a man who once said: “Everything is negotiable.” Where they find reassurance, I see cause for great alarm in an entirely transactional, values-free American foreign policy that no longer feels any moral responsibility to champion liberty, human rights and the rule of law. Just hear the delight being expressed by autocrats the world over.The gravest threat to the planet is a conflict between major powers. We were already in the throes of a turbulent transition from American dominance into a multi-polar world. Even the most level-headed leadership would struggle to manage that massive geopolitical adjustment. That is why the temperament of Donald Trump, a thin-skinned narcissist prone to react to the slightest provocation by lashing out, so terrifies so many.By all means hope for the best. It will make it easier to sleep at night. The sensible will prepare for the worst.TopicsUS politicsOpinionDonald TrumpcommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
For 240 years, America has toyed with the idea of a woman becoming president. This year, for an all too brief moment, it looked as if the idea might become a reality. But the dream of a female president has remained just that, a disingenuous myth America occasionally serves up in fictions, but never permits to spill into its facts. Instead of witnessing the landmark moment of a woman moving into the Oval Office, we can now see the all-too-real misogyny that became a feature of the 2016 presidential campaign bedding down in the corridors of power. When Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman” in the final debate, only a few days after a series of recordings revealed him admitting to a series of sexual aggressions and assaults, many people thought it was the end of his bid for the presidency. Instead, social media during election night revealed Trump supporters – male and female – voicing the diehard view that a woman is simply not capable of being president, too weak to stand up to foreign leaders and the military.The sucker punch for those of us who believe that this particular woman was spectacularly more ready for the White House than her grossly underqualified and abusive opponent is that – as has historically been the case – once again, a female candidate did not carry even the female vote. A staggering 53% of white women voted against Clinton and for the man whose statements and attitudes brought misogyny, kicking and screaming, into the light.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Hillary Clinton’s concession speech in fullWhen Clinton conceded the presidency, she tried to offer hope to the women, especially the young women, of America: “I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but I know someday someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now.” Of course, we may not think that right now, because right now the media is focusing its attention on white-male economic and racial disempowerment. It is not interested in the disempowerment of women, but that is also the story of this election, which was fought over a series of fictions, myths and outright lies.For two solid years, the media engaged in spreading half-truths and misinformation about the first serious female candidate for president. For a few days after we learned that Trump likes to grab women “by the pussy”, the mainstream media began admitting how many of the derogatory stories swirling around Clinton were misogynistic, how many were – literally – trumped-up fictions. But then the FBI intervened, and the story reverted to its misogynistic mean, relentlessly informing the American electorate that Clinton is duplicitous, dishonest, untrustworthy. It was character assassination, and it worked.Anyone who still believes these claims are factual – and on the evidence, some 59 million people do – should consider how closely they resemble the stories that have always been told about female politicians, both real and fictional. To do so is to realise that it is time to stop suggesting, as some commentators are doing, that Clinton failed us. The truth is, we failed her.To understand a culture, you must know its stories. Taking a hard look at some of the tales we’ve told about the idea of a female president can teach us a great deal about this election, as well as those to come. The women who have become American presidents in the history of fiction are not quite as vanishingly scarce as they are in reality, but they’re not exactly numerous – and, until very recently, the fictions were as presumptively white as the candidates. Just 14 women have mounted a serious bid for US president, three of whom made it to a major party’s national convention, although only one secured that nomination. Five became third party candidates, and two became major party running mates, both of whom lost. We have had three female secretaries of state, one female speaker of the House. But no woman has ever been elected to the executive branch of the American government.The idea of a woman in the White House has always prompted the same responses: it is either a joke, a disaster or a cheat. Clinton was endlessly called “Crooked Hillary” to shouts of “Lock her up”, although her crimes always varied. Had she murdered Vince Foster, or Ron Brown? Had she covered up wrongdoing in the deaths of Americans at Benghazi, stolen millions, or was she, in fact, Beelzebub? It didn’t matter. What mattered was the idea of illegitimacy. Most stories imagine a female president who lies, cheats, murders or sleeps her way into office, or inherits the roleOur fictions about women becoming president have always worked to invalidate the very idea. Take, for example, the novel co-authored by a former speaker of the House and avowed enemy of (both) Clintons, Newt Gingrich, which tells of a woman who becomes America’s first woman president and chooses politics over national interest, resulting in a “Benghazi style attack”. Its title? Duplicity. Now Gingrich has been tipped for a cabinet appointment, because propaganda works.In neither history nor fiction are there more than a handful of stories that imagine a female president who could ascend to the highest office in the land honestly, through merit and hard work; instead she either lies, cheats, murders or sleeps her way into office; or she inherits the role, passively, from a man. Fictional depictions of a female presidential candidate on the actual campaign trail are even rarer; this may correlate with the fact that, as Clinton herself noted, she was always more popular in office than while running. When female presidents are imagined, they are in office thanks to a fait accompli of some kind, which is also delegitimising: power was handed to her, or she inveigled her way into it. Either way, it’s crooked. Just like Hillary.“Serious” fiction is a club into which women presidents aren’t admitted. They are segregated by genre, cropping up primarily in satire or science fiction: female presidents are a joke, or exist in an alternate reality. Women are disproportionately more likely to become president in disaster movies and post-apocalyptic scenarios, because only when large segments of the human race are eradicated do we imagine women in charge. In early science fiction tales, the apocalypse often took the form of the nullification of men, as women’s real political gains sent masculinity into an imaginary crisis from which it has not recovered.From the first, any writing that considered the possibility of a woman president focused not on what it would mean to women, but on what it would mean to men – even when written by a woman. What seems to be the earliest fictional depiction of a female presidential candidate was a burlesque provoked by Victoria Woodhull, the first woman who ran. In 1871, Harriet Beecher Stowe published My Wife and I, narrated by a man who thinks he supports women’s rights until he meets “Audacia Dangyereyes”, who wants to be president. Her name (“damn your eyes”) says it all: she is dangerous, aggressive and ludicrous, a “crack-brained” unwomanly “creature”, “an amphibious animal”, loud and vulgar. By no coincidence, she is also accused of swindling and fraud. She singlehandedly undermined, we are told, “the whole woman movement; for the main argument for proposing it, was to introduce into politics that superior delicacy and purity, which women manifest in family life”. It was her fault if feminism didn’t take hold, because she was doing such a bad job at representing it.That should sound familiar, because it is a very persistent trope: America pretends it is perfectly comfortable with the ideal of a female president, only to discover that it is disappointed or horrified by every human woman it encounters. Words like “tarnished” enter the story when idealised women fail to materialise. That idealised women should cleanse American politics with their purity was the view taken by Stowe’s sister, Isabella Beecher Hooker, who made the news in 1888 by predicting America would soon see a woman president, “because the men would vote for her out of pure gallantry and chivalry”. That’s not quite how it played out. American women wouldn’t even get the vote until 1920, when the 19th amendment was ratified. Newspapers instantly produced satirical visions of women marching into the White House. One imagined the inauguration of the first woman president: “It will be a woman’s parade … at this Waterloo of Pants place aux femmes!” One can only imagine what the author would have made of Clinton’s pantsuits.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Margaret Chase Smith, the first woman elected to the Senate who had not inherited the seat from a man. Photograph: Bettmann ArchiveFour years later, the first fictional female president seems to have arrived, in a 1924 silent film called The Last Man on Earth. Based loosely on Mary Shelley’s 1826 novel The Last Man, it takes place between 1924 and 1950, as America is hit by a plague of “masculitis”, which leaves adult men sterile. By 1950, a woman has become “presidentress” (her enemy, prophetically, leads “the Tea House Gang”). In “a world dominated altogether by women”, the presidentress needs to find the last man on earth to continue the human race. The anxieties about women taking power from men are transparent: this “manless world” prompted newspaper headlines such as “He-Man Type of Girls Rule in Film of Future”.As American culture began worrying less about women’s purity and more about their growing political and economic power, fictions responded by imagining idealised female presidents in terms of passivity and pacifism. In 1931, a play called A Woman of Destiny featured a widow named Constance Goodwin who became president. Six years later, the play was turned into a novel set in the near future of 1943, and seems to have been the first portrayal of an actual female president serving in a realistic, contemporary setting. It was also the first of a long line of stories to imagine a woman who inherited the White House only when a male president dropped dead, and who leaves presidential duties because she has “more important” things to do – namely, be a grandmother. As women made historic gains, stories began dealing with how 'Mrs President' could balance leadership with motherhoodIn 1932, a book by Charles Eliot Blanchard called A New Day Dawns imagined American history as told in 2162, a story focusing on “the tremendous struggle of 1962”, in which a woman was elected president and ushered in a new era of altruism. This may sound encouraging, but Jane B Stanton, an imaginary descendant of the feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, was a eugenicist, instituting a passive aggressive totalitarianism that relies on sterilisation to create a “perfect” – and profoundly racist – society.As real American women continued making historic gains, the question of male power and prerogatives became paramount. Stories began dealing explicitly with how a putative female president (“Mrs President”) could possibly balance leading the free world with motherhood. (A female candidate who didn’t have a family was unimaginable: single or gay women were not permitted into national fantasies.) In 1948 Margaret Chase Smith became the first woman elected to the Senate who had not inherited the seat from a man. A year later a musical called As the Girls Go appeared on Broadway; it was originally titled The First Gentleman of the Land, and its producer reportedly checked with a lawyer “on the constitutionality of a lady’s being elected to the White House”. Because how could a woman president be legitimate? Set in 1953, four years into the future, it is a comedy about the “First Husband”, who enjoys leering at the pretty girls he encounters and occasions jokes about gender role reversals that even reviewers in 1949 found unfunny.A less silly depiction came in the 1952 novel The Dark Mare – conflating “dark horse” and “nightmare”. Another contemporary story, Damsey Wilson’s novel tells of the presidency of Miriam Hall Bradley. Again there is a great deal of anxiety about “the dubious title of – First Husband”; Mr Bradley complains that his wife is “goofy on feminism”, and much of the plot concerns whether he will leave her for a woman who isn’t busy leading the free world. Project Moonbase (1953) is frequently credited (incorrectly) as the first film to depict a female president, but it may be the first science fiction tale in which the female president is a minor character, both taking for granted and marginalising the idea.When Margaret Chase Smith made an unsuccessful 1964 bid for the Republican nomination, the journalist Russell Baker wrote: “Washington’s political chinstrokers give Senator Margaret Chase Smith little chance to become president this year – and in any case, since Mrs Smith is a widow, the First Gentleman problem would not arise.” A film made that same year, Kisses for My President, focused entirely on the “First Gentleman problem”: its strapline was “When a woman becomes president of the US, what happens to her poor husband when he becomes the ‘First Lady’?” The film opens with Leslie Harrison McCloud (Polly Bergen) being sworn in, while the camera captures her husband’s peevish expression. The eventual happy ending is his, not hers: Mrs McCloud gets pregnant and resigns, as his virility triumphs.Gradually, however, women like Clinton, Geraldine Ferraro and Sarah Palin began to inch nearer. In 1972, congresswoman Shirley Chisholm became the first African American woman to run for president. As these real women got closer to the White House, our fictions accelerated correspondingly. Science fiction, in particular, always interested in finding imaginary ways to test cultural and political waters, began portraying an increasing number of female presidents (many of whom were also non-white). There was President Juanita Alvarez in Sunstorm (2005) by Arthur C Clarke and Stephen Baxter, and President Helen Lasker in Carl Sagan’s Contact (1985). Female presidents in apocalyptic disaster movies tend not to survive the story: President Janice Castleman in KA Applegate’s Remnants (2001) is wiped out along with everyone else on earth. Robert J Sawyer’s Red Planet Blues (2013) features a female president whose brain survives her assassination and is uploaded into an artificial body, which sounds like the kinds of things Hillary Clinton was accused of (her charges included using body doubles).      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   ‘Her best hope was to be disliked and crooked, but at least she’d be president’ … Julia Louis-Dreyfus in Veep. Photograph: HBOIn fact, fictional women presidents were unlikely to last much longer in the field than their historical counterparts. Patty Duke played President Julia Mansfield in the television satire Hail to the Chief (1985), which lasted all of seven episodes; her plotlines still involved contending with a philandering husband and problem children. By 2008, Geena Davis was the vice president who succeeded a president who died of an aneurysm in Commander in Chief; it too focused on the efforts of the president to balance her personal and professional life, running to all of 18 episodes. State of Affairs, with Alfre Woodard as the first female black president, lasted 13 episodes. The series 24 recently managed a white woman president after an African American man for two whole seasons, until she resigned over the ethical compromises she’d made. Similarly, Selina Meyer became president for two seasons of Veep when the president resigned, before being replaced by another woman president. Selina’s incompetence is a large focus of the comedy, although the show also directs much satirical firepower at lingering misogynistic tropes. In the last season, Selina tells her daughter about the moment of her political awakening, when her father said to her, “You know, a lot of people don’t like Nixon, but by God, they respect him. And that’s you, peanut.” It sounded prophetic to many of us: her best hope was to be disliked and crooked, but at least she’d be president.It didn’t turn out that way. Republicans so successfully attacked Clinton’s legitimacy, and that of the “establishment” she supposedly represented despite being the first female major-party candidate in the 240-year history of the United States of America, that they invalidated her bid. A woman who’d withstood decades of misogynistic abuse could not conquer an unashamed misogynist; the “nasty woman” who devoted her life to public service could not overcome the rich bully who decided to pick up politics on a whim. Along with the validity of Clinton’s actual campaign went, many fear, the very idea of a female president for at least another generation. It will remain at best a fiction, a mendacious myth, while reality has gone beyond satire. It turns out that even an apocalypse is not enough to make a woman president.TopicsPoliticsUS elections 2016Hillary ClintonUS politicsfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content

One of Queensland’s leading exponents of what miners and conservative politicians brand environmental “lawfare” has been thrust into the role of trying to win what the Greens consider their most winnable seat at the next state election.Michael Berkman – a lawyer at the Environmental Defenders Office Queensland who has played a key role in a slew of court battles against Adani, Gina Rinehart’s Alpha Coal and New Acland Coal – will be the Greens candidate for the inner Brisbane seat of Mount Coot-tha.Berkman will go head to head with the Palaszczuk government environment minister, Steven Miles, also the first to hold the title of minister for the Great Barrier Reef, who was swept to office in 2015 on the back of strong Green preferences.Berkman said it was “an exciting opportunity” to be standing in the state seat the Greens considered most likely to swing their way in the near future. Coal is still king in their worldMichael Berkman on the ALP and their candidate Steven MilesHis credentials as an environmental scientist, as well as through his extensive work challenging some of Australia’s most contentious mining projects, will be held up as a direct challenge to Miles in an increasingly green-conscious electorate.The Queensland Greens convener and former federal senator Andrew Bartlett said Berkman, who had worked on eight high-profile cases against big miners since 2014, was “an absolute star of the environment movement”.“As a scientist and environmental lawyer he’s dedicated his working life to protect Queensland ecosystems and communities from the excesses of the fossil fuel industry,” Bartlett said.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Michael Berkman meets some residents of Mount Coot-tha. Photograph: Supplied“His scientific knowledge and experience with complex legislation make him an ideal Green voice in the next state parliament.”Berkman said that despite Miles’s advocacy and some wins for environmental reform, Labor’s public support for Adani would “not play well in Mount Coot-tha because he ran so strongly on his credentials in terms of the reef and he personally, ostensibly is opposed to the expansion into the Galilee”.“But he appears to just not have the weight within cabinet to achieve any of those outcomes that his electors in Mt Coot-tha seem to be very concerned about. “I don’t think Mt Coot-tha voters will be very pleased by the extreme support the ALP has shown for Adani and Carmichael in particular.”The recent trajectory of Green voters in parts of inner Brisbane has sounded alarm bells for Labor strategists who warn that the party, while facing a fight in the regions from a resurgent One Nation, also risks being outflanked to the left in the leafy suburbs of the state capital.Carmichael mine to be given 'essential' status in sign of Palaszczuk support Read moreThe victory of Queensland’s first Greens councillor, Jonathan Sri, to inner south Brisbane ward the Gabba in this year’s local government election raised questions about what kind of challenge Labor’s left faction deputy premier, Jackie Trad, might face in her overlapping South Brisbane seat.This week, the Greens announced social scientist and community worker Amy MacMahon as the candidate to take on Trad, who has overseen the approval of a controversial West Village development that represents the kind of local concerns MacMahon will tap into.“Following the Greens victory in the Gabba ward I think people now realise it’s possible for the Greens to win seats in Queensland,” MacMahon said.The party’s only state representative to date, Indooroopilly MP Ronan Lee, defected from Labor mid-term in 2008 but did not win re-election as a Green.The Greens believe MacMahon, who plans to campaign on “sustainable development, corporate donations, housing affordability, and growing wealth inequality”, could win South Brisbane by swinging 1500 votes her way.But nowhere does a Green ascendancy appear more possible than in Mount Coot-tha.In 2015, Miles with 32.6% of the primary vote trumped his Liberal National rival on 42.9% thanks to preferences from the Greens on 22.1%. Queensland elects its first Greens councillor, Jonathan Sri Read moreIn the local government election this year, 27.9% of voters in Mt Coot-tha booths put the Greens first, compared with 24% for Labor (with the LNP on 48.1%).In the federal election, the Greens took 27% of primary votes in the booths where Labor took 24.9%.It’s numbers like these that would exercise the mind of former state Labor secretary, now federal senator, Anthony Chisholm, who said in March that Sri’s election was “something I had always feared happening but always hoped would be avoided [as] the long term repercussions for [Labor] based on the Greens gaining a representative toe hold are dire”.Chisholm, who performed reviews of the New South Wales and Tasmanian election campaigns for Labor, wrote in the Courier-Mail that Sri’s election heralded the arrival of the Greens as serious challengers in urban Queensland.“The evidence out of NSW and Victoria is once the Greens win lower house seats in the inner city, they are incredibly hard to dislodge and they also are able to expand out to neighbouring seats over time,” Chisholm said.Berkman said he was unsurprised by Chisholm’s comments about the threat to Labor posed by Greens in inner-city Brisbane.“I think they reflect the reality that Labor doesn’t actually provide a real progressive voice for Queenslanders anymore,” he said.“Those voters on the left who are genuinely concerned about these key progressive issues like a sustainable future, women’s reproductive rights, LGBTI rights, sustainable development more broadly – those voters no longer have a voice in the ALP.”The state election is due by January 2018 but is widely expected to take place some time in 2017.Berkman said his campaign would hinge in large part on his own background at the front line of environmental legal battles.“I think the immediate experience I have with these major resource projects provides a stark contrast to the alternative in Miles and the ALP where coal is still king in their world,” he said.Berkman agreed his work may also provoke a response from conservatives who have waged a prolonged public relations battle against those who take big miners to court.“I’ve always viewed the ‘lawfare’ response as fairly shrill and ill-conceived. It’s a sensationalist response to what is a perfectly legitimate exercise of legal rights by concerned community groups and individuals,” he says.“I think the voters in Mt Coot-tha have a clear enough understanding of these fundamental tenets of democracy and rule of law to recognise that ‘lawfare’ is something of a political scapegoat in circumstances where governments don’t like the choice of particular groups to exercise their rights.“It frustrates me immensely hearing politicians and lobbyists describing ‘vexatious litigation’ when none of it’s vexatious. If any one piece of litigation were vexatious, it would be thrown out of court immediately. It wouldn’t be heard and decided the way all these cases have been.”The chair of EDO Queensland’s management committee, Michelle Maloney, said while it respected the right of anyone to run for office, it “does not support, promote or oppose any particular political party or candidate”. “EDO Queensland promotes changes to law and policy which protect the environment and advance sustainable development,” she said.TopicsQueensland politicsAustralian GreensBrisbaneLabor partyAdani GroupMiningfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Here’s Daniel Taylor’s match report from Wembley:England’s hat-trick of slick headers put feeble Scotland in their place Read moreAnd Ewan Murray’s verdict on Gordon Strachan and Scotland:Gordon Strachan’s Scotland time must be over after gamble against England fails | Ewan Murray Read more Three sharp finishes enabled England to take advantage of shoddy Scottish defending. Scotland, who pressed England well and passed better than the hosts in the first half, had chances to score and really rattle England but they fluffed them. Neither side showed enough quality to suggest they’ll be challenging for the World Cup but the result means England are closing in on the tournament. Scotland, meanwhile, are second from bottom in the group and may soon be searching for a new manager. Strachan’s approach to this game was good, mind  Disappointment for the Scotland fans at the final whistle. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian 90+1 min: Walker plays a ropey back pass, giving a sniff of a chance to Griffiths, who’s chopped down from behind by Rooney. That’s a booking for Rooney and proof that England are not good enough to pose. 89 min: ITV choose Lallana as their man of the match, with honourable mentions for Walker and Rose. Can’t argue with that. I’d give a nod to Sturridge, too.   Scotland’s Christophe Berra slides into Kyle Walker. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian 86 min: A touch, a palpable touch! After prolonged English knock-about play, Scotland get a toe to the ball, putting it out for a throw-in to England. 83 min: England are showing a disgraceful lack of bloodthirstiness here. Scotland are beaten and dispirited, England should be going all guns blazing to inflict more pain on their auld enemy. But they’re should faffing about. Which, come to think of it, must be more galling for the Scots. So fair enough.  The England fans enjoy the match at Wembley. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian Scotland substitution: Ritchie on, Snodgrass off. 80 min: Freekick to England. Thirty yards out and nearly dead central. Dier toys with the idea of paying tribute to Hotshot Hamish but eventually elects to try a delicate curler towards the top corner. It hits the wall and goes behind. Scotland substitution: Paterson on, Anya off. The Derby County reserve did reasonably well as an experimental right-back.  79 min: With Slovakia and Slovenia also winning at the moment, Scotland could fall to fifth in the group today, above only Malta. 78 min: Scotland get caught in a state of confusion outside their own box. Lallana nicks the ball and slips it through to Sterling inside the area. Surrounded by Scots he tries to thread the ball through to Vardy, who’s lurking six yards from goal. But the pass is overhit and Scotland are let off.  Scotland’s Ikechi Anya fends off Jamie Vardy. Photograph: John Sibley/Reuters 76 min: England are cruising now. The time for exploiting their mental fragility has long since passed and Scotland now have to watch them swagger. England substitution: Vardy on, Sturridge off.  71 min: A fine move by England culminates with Henderson playing a wicked curling pass across the face of goal. Sterling runs on to it and only has to tap it in from two yards ... but he lifts it over the bar! That’s Scottish-style finishing or, to be fair, not untypical of Sterling, an otherwise wonderful player. 70 min: England, as if managed by Pep Southgate, again play themselves into trouble by trying to pick a way past Scottish pressers. 67 min: England threaten a fourth, Lallana canters down the left and clips a dainty cross towards Rooney at the near post. But Rooney couldn’t adjust his body to apply a killer touch. Scotland substitution: McArthur on, Morrison off. “It’s not the misses, the comedy defending, the lack of quality or that strip,” sobs Tony Reekie. “It’s getting beaten by three crosses by a team so ordinary. Oh, and not playing Burke, the only spark of light we have.” That about sums it up.  64 min: Rose lunges at Snodgrass at the edge of the area. He goes through the player, gets the top of the ball and then catches Snodgrass again on the other leg. That’s reckless by any measure and should be a penalty. The ref sees things differently.   Dejection for Leigh Griffiths and Scott Brown. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters All too easy. Rooney curled in a perfect corner from the left. Cahill met it on the run at the near post - getting the jump on Hanley - and sends a powerful flicked header into the net. Scotland have lost the game, it’s just a question now of how much face they lose.  Gary Cahill glances the header past Craig Gordon. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian 60 min: Don’t know what Strachan is waiting for. Scotland need something new up front. Burke fits the bill. 59 min: Walker hoists a high curling cross over from the right. Rooney collects it way beyond the far post and hooks it back across the face of goal. Hanley does well to scoop it away to safety.  57 min: Forrest catches Cahill doing a bad Beckenbauer impression, so the centreback hauls him down. Another easy yellow card decision for the ref.  55 min: Scotland are still passing better than England. At least they were until one was misplaced and Griffiths lunged at it and caught Rose. That’s a yellow card to go with his pink shirt. (Actually, for what it’s worth, I think that pink and black number is quite sharp). “No Liverpool players, no party - henderson will be next,” trumpets Harry Palmer. Careful, you don’t want to start sounding like West Ham fans.  Scotland’s Leigh Griffiths is shown a yellow card by referee Cuneyt Cakir. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters 52 min: Another decent move by Scotland - neat passing and smart movement around the box. Morrison ends up dashing into the box to receive a pass and get off a shot. On target, at least, but too gentle to worry Hart. Finishing has been the key difference between the sides. Another expert header, this time from Lallana, who guides it downward into the net from nine yards after an excellent burst to the byline and cross by Rose.   England’s Adam Lallana guides the ball in to the corner of the net for England’s second. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters  Craig Gordon is unable to keep out Lallana’s deft header. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian 49 min: Anya robs the ball off Rooney deep in Scottish territory. Then he skedaddles forward to launch a counter-attack. A fine move develops, as Wallace provides an option on the left, receives the ball and hurtles down the flank. He crosses towards Griffiths, who cunnignly lets it run to Forrest, who takes one good touch and then ... drags his shots wide from 16 yards! A great move, another chance wasted!   Scotland’s James Morrison shoots but his shot is saved. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters 47 min: England’s attempts to play their way out of from the back have frequently been pitiful. Scottish pressing once makes them cough up possession easily, Cahill donking the ball out of play as he tried to tickle it down the line.  46 min: No personnel changes during the break.  “Not checked the table but guessing we’ll be near bottom as it stands,” sighs Simon McMahon. “Strexit?” My money’d be on 1-1 at this stage.  The half petered out quite untidily after a bright start and a relatively messy but exciting middle, which featured a fine goal by Sturridge, by far the best thing England have done all game. Scotland remain well in it because they have shown their capacity to unsettle England, whose passing has often been atrocious. But the Scots have yet to show any sign of sharpness up front, whereas England look threatening when they manage to cobble together moves and get as far as the opposing box. The men on the bench could yet have a big say in how this ends. Burke’s time has to be close.  Gareth Southgate issues instructions from the sidelines. Photograph: Michael Regan/The FA/Getty Images 43 min: Sloppy all round. “Hanley’s record at attacking set pieces so far is: fouls conceded: 2; free headers stuffed up: 1. Probably best sending someone else up next time.” Reckon that’s why England don;t appear to be bothering to mark him? 41 min: Save for some flashes of skill from Sterling and Sturridge, this has been low-quality fare. But it’s taut, feisty and engrossing like a family tiff. And the result is still far from certain.  39 min: The Scottish fans still believe. Another loud rendition of Flower of Sotland forms the soundtrack to another freekick delivery from the left by Snodgrass. But Hanley fouls before he can meet it so now England have a freekick. 36 min: Elsewhere in this group, Slovakia are mauling Lithuania 3-0, and Malta are holding Slovenia at 0-0.  34 min: Rose races into the box in a bid to get on the end of a clipped pass. He gets past Snodgrass near the byline... and then falls to the ground. Everyone looks to the ref to see what he makes of it. If there was contact it was minimal and unintentional. No penalty.   Danny Rose goes down under pressure from Robert Snodgrass. Photograph: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images

The outrageous changes to the shape of our beloved Toblerone chocolate.

But all of these things have become part of a slow, heavy, ominous collective sigh that has summed up the past few months. Indeed, 2016 has been defined by a creeping sense of dread that all the progress humanity has made over the past few decades – centuries, if you’re feeling particularly doomy – might be about to unravel.But then she was writing in the golden era before Trump was elected and we found out that Leonard Cohen had died... In a week that brought us President-elect Trump, closer to home, Brits had our own reasons to feel that droning mix of fear and shame: a UN inquiry concluded that the UK’s austerity policies amounted to “systematic violations” of disabled people’s rights. The work and pensions secretary, Damian Green, dismissed the scathing report as “patronising and offensive” to disabled people. Which is ironic, really, because I’d say the Conservatives telling paraplegics and cancer patients that being forced to pay the bedroom tax whilst having their disability benefit cut and social care removed “isn’t really as bad as you think” is the definition of patronising and offensive.  There’s been a lot of talk of a possible future president in Michelle Obama, but this reader doesn’t see it:   alexito 11 November 2016 3:36pmI'm astonished to see people quite seriously expressing hope that Michelle Obama will run next time.

He was also one of the first to congratulate him publicly. After a meeting in New York in September, where he met both Trump and Clinton, he described Trump as “a strong leader.” Trump in turn called Sisi “a fantastic guy”.   Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Photograph: Cathal McNaughton/ReutersTrump’s victory has divided Egyptian society. Some are relieved to see Clinton — who they believe supported the Muslim Brotherhood — lose. Others are devastated, and fear the repercussions of his win. As part of a community project we asked people in Egypt to share their thoughts with us. Here’s what they said.“Sisi was more than thrilled by his win. Trump, as a fascist leader, won’t be concerned much with the state of human rights. His support will directly result in more bloodshed and more violations of law and human rights in Egypt.“When the far-right controls the most powerful office in the world, this will give a huge push to all the rightwing in the world. I’m talking about the extremist terrorist movements. Electing an anti-Muslim anti-Arab as a president is going to feed more and more the image those movements are trying to spread about the US as the biggest devil in the world, and will further inflate the violence and terrorism. This will only help increase the instability and the warfare in the region, and maybe the whole world” – Amr, Egypt“We live in a police state where students, activists and journalists disappear or are jailed. The Obama administration had been putting pressure on our government to improve human rights and freedom of speech, but I doubt Donald Trump’s administration will do the same. This is evident from our current president’s eagerness to connect with Trump.“Both Hillary Clinton and Trump are heavily disliked in the Middle East by Muslims and Arabs. While Trump is openly hostile to Muslims and clueless about the region, Hillary’s policy as secretary of state has been very deliberate and damaging to the region despite her party’s more tolerant and inclusive tone” – Mai, Egypt Is it time to take a step back?

Steven W Thrasher’s response to the news this week was one of the most heartfelt, simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking: “Hold tight to the ones you love, please ,” he wrote, “ because all we’ve got is each other.” It seems to be a thought that occurred to quite a few of my friends at the same time. “Well, the worst has happened,” texted my friend Alison. “We are terrified here.” And then, “I just wanted to say that I love you dearly.” And if you think about it, that’s a hopeful response to an otherwise hopeless event.

Now a year’s worth of reading cookbooks on a daily basis – for my job – has made one thing clear. People who love to cook, love to share. And the one thing they share more than anything is a love of feeding people and the unshakeable belief that cooking a meal for someone is bold and restorative, an act of true love. Georgina Hayden wrote a book called Stirring Slowly this year, which is full of the kind of warming meals you just want to come home to on a cold night. She talks about food that heals. So you know what, let’s invite each other round to dinner. Let’s make lunchboxes for colleagues. Let’s bring cakes into offices and flapjacks into classrooms. Let’s take care of each other. Let’s eat together.  I interviewed photographers who’d taken pictures of Trump throughout his career, and it struck me just how malleable the president-elect is. One of the photographers, Chris Buck, described Trump as being very different in person from his bolshy public persona: gracious, funny, charming. But another, Nigel Parry, said he was exactly the same as in public, that what you see is what you get. The two photos were admittedly taken a decade apart, but the disparity in their stories seems to suggest that Trump is even more chameleonic that we imagine, to the point of never having a stable version of himself: a man who makes up his life as he goes along, powered by a kind of barrelling narcissism and alpha-male presumptuousness.

A question:   AnitaIslington 11 November 2016 2:39pmDid Trump phone Theresa May or the other way round?She certainly didn’t seem to be at the front of the queue ...  sarah maclean (@sarahmaclean)I went outside to discover a Trump sign on my street, in a window that did not have that sign on Tuesday.November 10, 2016Who were the closet Trump voters? That’s a question I’ve been hearing again and again in the past few days. I heard it at an election night party for students of Wharton, Trump’s alma mater. A student there told me that no one had been a vocal Trump supporter among the student body, but as the returns rolled in, she wondered how of them must have be closet Trump fans. I heard it talking to cultural critic Mikki Kendall, who looked at the strong support for Trump among white women – exit polls suggested 53% of white women voted for Trump – and concluded that it was very difficult to say “that no one who was theoretically on the left voted for Trump.” Trump’s win came as a shock to many Americans. They’re now wondering who supported him all along--and simply did not talk about it. For some Americans, that’s a source of anxiety. At a protest in Chicago Thursday night, a young woman told the Washington Post that she was deeply upset by the people who had voted for Trump. “I see people differently now. I don’t smile at people on the street anymore. Because you never know,” she said. Did British voters feel the same sense of shock that there might be closet Brexit supporters who had been around them all the time? Do you have any advice for Americans who are devastated by this outcome--the stages of mourning a Brexit? 
A year before he died in 1977, the blind jazz genius Rahsaan Roland Kirk inspired an impromptu parade in Newark, New Jersey. One minute he was playing the downtown club Sparky J’s. The next he was leading his band, pied-piper-like, across the street to the Key Club, a different nightspot, while still making music on one of the three saxes he was known to play in unison and in harmony.“It was legendary,” said Junius Williams, a Newark author and educator who also saw Dizzy Gillespie at Sparky J’s back in the day. Five of the best young female jazz musicians Read moreIt was also kind of prescient. In 2016, Newark is one nonstop, ongoing, jazz parade: Wynton Marsalis, the Robert Glasper Experiment, Dianne Reeves, Phil Perry, David Sanborn and Anjelique Kidjo have been in and out town for shows. Dorthaan Kirk, the widow of Rahsaan who goes by the nickname “Newark’s first lady of jazz”, has hosted longtime greats including Freddy Cole, Jon Faddis and Rufus Reid at a pair of local series she organizes (both of them running through 2017, one of them free). And by the end of the year, a new, intimate club called Clement’s Place connected to the city’s renowned Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers-Newark will have attracted the TS Monk Sextet and the soul-threaded and Eubie Blake Award-winning Houston Person Quartet.Behind all the action is a celebration of the city’s birthday – 2016 marks Newark’s 350th year – that, together with the TD James Moody jazz festival, an annual celebration of jazz running through the end of November, has revived its reputation as a serious jazz town. The Grammy-winning bassist and bandleader Christian McBride, who is performing at Moody Fest on 18 November alongside Sharon Jones, Bettye LaVette and the James Brown Alumni Band at the city’s most thriving jazz venue, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, saw it coming. “Newark’s place in jazz history includes Sarah Vaughan, Wayne Shorter, James Moody, Woody Shaw and Larry Young, among others. That coupled with its modern-day vibrancy makes Newark one of the greatest jazz cities in the world,” McBride said in early November from Europe, where he was touring. He is especially qualified to say so. McBride first played in Newark as a young performer 26 years ago and, since 2012, has been NJPAC’s jazz adviser; he also hosts the NPR show Jazz Night in America, a co-production with Lincoln Center and WBGO-FM, the only full-time jazz format station broadcast in New York and New Jersey. On 20 November he will be among the judges of what John Schreiber, founder of the Moody festival and NJPAC’s president and CEO, called one of the centerpieces of a monthlong event: the Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Competition. “Jazz singing is bred in the bone. And Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald were kind of No 1 and No 2 in terms of the great individual voices of jazz singing,” Schreiber said. “Sarah Vaughan was an authentic Newark girl – she went to high school here and lived a lot of her life here. And so I said, ‘OK, what can we do to honor Sarah?’” That was five years ago, when Schreiber signed on with NJPAC after decades of producing and curating festivals including Newport Jazz and JVC Jazz.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Sharon Jones will play the TD James Moody jazz festival in Newark later in November. Photograph: New Jersey Performing Arts CenterThe result is the upcoming competition in which five finalists, whittled from a pool of hundreds around the world who sent online auditions to Newark this spring, perform before McBride and four fellow jazz-luminary judges – Dianne Reeves among them – plus a packed NJPAC house. The winner is announced at the end of the night and walks away with a recording contract, a $5,000 prize and a slot to perform at the Montreal Jazz Fest next summer. Is jazz entering a new golden age? Read more“She also has a right to say she won the Sarah Vaughan International Jazz Competition. And then all of a sudden she has some stature with the public,” Schreiber said. Jazz stature comes in a couple of shapes around Newark. There is the kind earned through sheer chops, like winning the vocal competition or commanding a massive audience during one of the organ jams held sporadically at Symphony Hall, a historic jazz venue not far from NJPAC. There is the kind Dorthaan Kirk has acquired through knowing everyone from Jimmy Heath to Gregory Porter and attracting them to town for her jazz series. (One is Dorthaan’s Place, a jazz brunch at NJPAC; the other is Jazz Vespers at Bethany Baptist church. Both are monthly, Bethany is free.)There is also a kind of stature bestowed through scholarship. The night before the Sarah Vaughan competition, for example, McBride’s Trio will play The Divine One, a concert at NJPAC honoring Vaughan that includes a film about her life and a panel discussion hosted by the longtime jazz producer Todd Barkan, also artistic director at Jazz at Lincoln Center’s Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola. Like a lot of the smartest jazz events around town, it’s being sponsored by the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers-Newark. The jazz institute, founded in 1952, is the most extensive jazz archive and library in the US. It includes more than 150,000 recordings and 6,000 books, and treasures such as Miles Davis’s trumpet and Curly Russell’s bass. Before Ken Burns made his 10-part, Emmy-nominated mini-series Jazz in 2000, he spent a year exploring the institute’s trove of recordings. Forest Whitaker visited the archives in 2011 for research on a film about Louis Armstrong, And Michael K Smith spent some time browsing there after his role as Chalky White on HBO’s Boardwalk Empire got him interested 20s- and 30s-era jazz.

Photograph: Ed BergerEarlier this year, the Jazz Institute entered the club business with Clement’s Place, a 75-seat venue done up in jazz memorabilia on the ground floor of a historical neoclassical Newark skyscraper. Minus the whiffs of cigar smoke and seal-fresh whiskey (Clement’s pours beer and wine only), it’s a throwback to the tight-knit jazz communities documented in the archives. “I didn’t expect it, but I love running the bar,” said Wayne Winbourne, the institute’s executive director. Clement’s is named for Dr Clement A Price, a beloved Rutgers-Newark professor and devoted jazz fan who died suddenly in 2014. “We’re open to the community, so we’re seeing a cross-section of folks from Newark who are bringing real energy and dynamism.” They’re bringing it to monthly jam sessions organized in cooperation with NJPAC as part of the 350th birthday celebration, and they’re bringing it to more subdued events such as a series of curated listening sessions Winbourne says he is “sprinkling in” at Clement’s once or twice a month, between shows and jams. There’s already been listening sessions on very early Louis Armstrong and Harry “Sweets” Edison. “We’ve got incredible experts on staff who are just extremely knowledgeable,” said Winbourne. “Sometimes we get 10 people, sometimes we get 30. But we’ll have a drink, then we’ll play a cut. Then we’ll have another drink, and play another cut. It’s another way for us to bring the archives to the public, to draw upon the expertise of our staff and to engage the community. We’re tapping into an opportunity there.” There’s also an opportunity, because of the institute’s reputation “and because I know folks”, said Winbourne, to draw artists who might otherwise skip Newark when playing across the river in New York.“We have the Lance Bryant Quartet coming in later this year – he played with Lionel Hampton – and a concert coming up with the flutist Elise Wood. And I’m hoping to get Steve Wilson and Luis Bonilla in here,” said Winbourne. He may not have to try too hard: “There’s a jazz atmosphere now that’s so intimate, where we all feel so connected,” Winbourne said. “I think all of us here in Newark are looking at the rise of something special, something people are going to be talking about a long time.”TopicsJazzNew JerseyfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Donald Trump has won. Science and scientists played almost no part in the campaign. Now, scientists must consider how they fit into a Trump future. This won’t be easy. Many scientists are scared. In the tribal world of US politics, many now find themselves on the outside looking in. Most university scientists are Democrats, and the 2017 President, House and Senate will all be Republican. For this group, nothing portends disaster more than the elevation of a long-time opponent to national and international policies, Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, to oversee the transformation of the Environmental Protection Agency.Even those academics who lean Republican (many of whom are engineers, since you ask) would despise Trump’s rejection of what a George W Bush adviser once dismissed as the “reality-based community” (that is, anyone interested in prioritising evidence over faith).While speculating on details like who Trump will ask to replace John Holdren as his science advisor, scientists should not just be asking what Trump will do for them. They should face up to the difficult question of what they should be doing for Trump. Some scientists will have to join the White House itself. When George W. Bush was elected, his administration had a hard time finding a scientist willing to serve as his science advisor. When Jack Marburger, a highly respected administrator and physicist who was also a Democrat, took the job he was excoriated by his peers and excommunicated from some scientific circles. We see hints of similar responses to Trump’s election already. Earlier this week the American Physical Society issued a press release congratulating Trump on his victory and encouraging him to “make sustained and robust funding of scientific research a top priority.” The APS received so many complaints that it felt compelled to retract it and issue an apology. Some have already written off Trump’s yet-to-be-named science advisor. For instance, Robert Cook-Deegan of Arizona State University says, “For Trump, I’m not sure [his science advisor] would matter, because there won’t be any ‘policy’ apparatus… Science won’t get much attention, except when it gets in the way or bolsters support for a political priority.” Marburger was called a “prostitute” upon taking the position under Bush. There are thousands of political appointees, including many science positions, that will need to be nominated, expert advisory bodies constituted and reconstituted, and experts put into staff positions under the White House. Any scientist who agrees to hold their nose and work with the Trump administration should expect much of the same criticism received by Marburger. Some, such as government scientists, will not have much choice but to engage. That is their job. The rest of the scientific community must still ask itself some difficult questions. We suggest three:Is money all that matters?During the late stages of the presidential campaign, 69 Nobel Prize winners endorsed Hillary Clinton and pushed for more funding for research and policies that support the scientific workforce. They suggested that there were other reasons for their support, but focused on what the next president might do for the interests of the scientific community.The incoming president of the American Geophysical Union expressed a similar concern: “There’s a fear that the scientific infrastructure in the U.S. is going to be on its knees… Everything from funding to being able to attract the global leaders we need to do basic science research.”If Trump imagines that the scientific community could cause him trouble, one option would be to do what Nye Bevan did to reactionary doctors in setting up the NHS and “stuff their mouths with gold”. Trump could echo Obama’s rhetoric, promising to ‘restore science to its rightful place’ by increasing funding. It would be the Art of the Deal, and it would put critical scientists in a difficult position. No one knows what Trump will do – on science or much else. However, the history of US science funding shows that Republican presidents “appear more eager to spend [money on R&D] than their Democratic counterparts”. Priorities have varied, with Democrats spending more through the Environmental Protection Agency and Commerce while Republicans spend more on Defense, the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health. Overall spending on R&D is not well-correlated with party politics, mainly because science funding has long been a bipartisan priority. Other than the massive injections of cash through the Apollo programme and Obama’s smaller stimulus package more recently, non-defence science funding has remained pretty stable as a proportion of government discretionary spending since the end of World War Two. Without much discussion of the fiscal consequences, Trump has announced grand plans for increases in US infrastructure investment. For science, this could mean high-profile funding for NASA. Perhaps Newt Gingrich will revive his vision of a Moon base and a mission to Mars. The military-industrial-scientific complex, demoted since the end of the Cold War, could receive a boost. Organisations that advocate for more science funding have already sought to tie in R&D funding with Trump’s calls for greater investment. Scientists need to consider how to react to possible increases in funding as well as express fears of decreases. In doing so, they might position themselves as representatives of the public good rather than just another special interest group. Should pragmatism trump purity? How should scientists engage on policy issues such as vaccination and climate change, where Republicans are often accused of being anti-science, or worse, at war with science? Despite Trump’s rhetorical nods to the social conservative wing of his party during the campaign and his enthusiasm for convenient conspiracy theories, he is clearly a pragmatist with little worry about changing his policy preferences.Scientists should therefore ask themselves whether they would support policies that did what they regard as the right thing, but for the ‘wrong’ reasons. Policies focused on deploying electric vehicles and nuclear or wind power may be justified in purely economic rather than environmental terms. Alternatively, environmental regulations may provide convenient cover for the taxing of imports as the USA struggles to justify a new protectionism. When it comes to climate change, maybe the pragmatic business of policy design might finally take precedence over trying to convince a Republican Congress to see the world through a climate scientist’s eyes. Two days after the election a spokesperson for ExxonMobil tweeted the company’s strong support of the Paris agreement on climate change. Many environmental scientists have long seen ExxonMobil as antithetical to their cause. Would they make peace with big oil in order to defend the Paris agreement? Or will the battle against perceived enemies of science now take place on multiple fronts?It would be easy for scientists to bring back an opposition strategy focused on defending a so-called ‘war on science’. Much harder will be for the science community to support a government under the control of President Trump and a Republican Congress. Choices will have to be made. Scientists should be aware that the playbook that many followed to oppose President George W Bush may not work as well under a less ideologically-driven president. Who really benefits from science and innovation? Earlier this year, when a Trump presidency still seemed outlandish, science policy writer Colin Macilwain drew an uncomfortable picture in a Nature commentary. Science, along with other elites, has systematically ignored the concerns of people such as those who voted for Trump or for Brexit. According to Macilwain, experts, rather than challenging established interests, have often bolstered them, while pretending to remain distant from politics. Trump’s campaign tapped into a constituency that had been largely shut out from the benefits of technological progress and disproportionately suffered the consequences of expanding global trade. US and European elites pretend that unfettered technology will not only grow the economy but also close the gap between rich and poor. A recent issue of Wired magazine brought Obama into conversation with the gurus of Silicon Valley. Tim O’Reilly hailed the magic bullets of innovation, telling Obama that, “The best way for the tech industry to tackle inequality is for it to do what it’s supposed to do: innovate in ways that create actual gains in growth and productivity”.History tells us how bad this analysis is. Technology tends to widen the gap between rich and poor, simply because rich people are better able to take advantage of productivity gains than poor people. And yet the narrative of emancipatory technology continues. Meanwhile, Donald Trump gave an interview to Breitbart, a heavily partisan news site that has become depressingly relevant, in which he said, with reference to artificial intelligence, “I have always been concerned about the social breakdown of our culture caused by technology”. Now is the time to ask who really benefits from American innovation, and to rethink the responsibilities of scientists in engaging with inequality. Scientists who choose not to engage with a Trump Administration risk fueling the resentment and disenchantment that brought it to power. The scientific community could respond to the populist surge by devoting more attention to understanding the consequences of technological innovation on society, while developing alternatives paths to ensure that its benefits are shared more equitably and negative consequences more effectively anticipated and blunted.For scientists and other experts, the surprise election of Donald Trump to the US presidency comes with choices. Many of us were dismayed at the Brexit vote and now the election of Donald Trump. How we respond, inside our own communities and in relation to governments will determine whether we remain relevant or jeopardise the constructive role that we should play in policy and politics, regardless of our allegiances.TopicsSciencePolitical scienceDonald TrumpUS elections 2016US politicsblogpostsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Protesters across the US were on Friday gearing up for weekend demonstrations over the election of Donald Trump, as other activists began work on plans to disrupt the Republican’s inauguration in Washington early next year.Rowdy protests against Trump and his divisive campaign have spread to cities all over the country following his victory on Tuesday, leading to dozens of arrests and a complaint from Trump in one of his first public remarks as president-elect.More than 10,000 people have signed up to attend a noon march on Saturday from New York’s Union Square to Trump Tower, the future president’s home and corporate headquarters, while several other actions are planned for other cities.“Join us in the streets! Stop Trump and his bigoted agenda,” the organizers of the New York event said in a Facebook post.Trump complained in a tweet late on Thursday that “professional protesters, incited by the media” were tarnishing his electoral success, which he said was “very unfair”. Amid intense criticism, Trump said hours later in a second post that he appreciated the “passion for our great country” shown by demonstrators.Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!November 11, 2016Donald J.

We will all come together and be proud!November 11, 2016Activists expressed determination to build momentum for major activity on 20 January, when Trump will officially enter the White House.A “million women” march on the capital is being planned for the day of Trump’s inauguration, amid intense anger that the next US president allegedly sexually assaulted multiple women and boasted of doing so in a leaked recording.Leftwing and anarchist groups were also making plans for protests in Washington on inauguration day, according to flyers circulating online, raising the prospect of chaotic scenes as Trump takes the oath of office.Other activists were biding their time before mounting a response to Trump’s election. Patrisse Cullors, one of the founders of Black Lives Matter, said their movement was “grieving and mourning” following the result.“We are bringing folks together to imagine what kinds of organizing we will need to do under a Trump presidency,” said Cullors. “I do think we can organize as we have been, and build something bigger and stronger than the hate Trump and his team have exhibited towards marginalized communities.”Thousands of people took to the streets from Thursday night into Friday in Denver, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Portland, Oakland and several other US cities, as well as Vancouver, Canada. The protests were for the most part peaceful and orderly, though there were scattered acts of civil disobedience and damage to property.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Why America elected TrumpThe rowdiest scenes were in Portland, Oregon, where about 4,000 people marched into the city centre late on Thursday. At least 29 people were arrested after a minority of protesters threw objects at officers, smashed shop windows and damaged a car dealership, the Portland police department said, declaring the demonstration a riot. Officers used pepper spray and rubber projectiles to disperse the crowd, the department added. In Minneapolis, dozens of people marched on to Interstate 94, blocking traffic in both directions for at least an hour as police stood by. A smaller band of demonstrators briefly halted traffic on a busy Los Angeles highway before police cleared them off.Baltimore police reported that about 600 people marched through the Inner Harbor area, with some blocking roadways by sitting in the street. Two people were arrested, police said. One of the largest demonstrations was in Denver, where a crowd estimated to number about 3,000 gathered on the grounds of the Colorado state capitol and marched through the city centre.

This is not the future we want,” she said.In Oakland, where 30 people were arrested on Wednesday night, a crowd gathered on Thursday but the protests were more subdued than the previous evening, when a series of small fires were set, some windows were smashed and a few people threw rocks at police.

Lewis & Clark College student Gregory McKelvey, who organised a protest in Portland on Thursday, told local NBC affiliate KGW: “We think that because Trump is president, it becomes even more urgent for our city to become what people want it to be. It’s an anti-Trump protest but also a call for change in our city because we need to push for progress here.”Elsewhere on Thursday, hundreds protested in Salt Lake City, Utah; San Francisco; Houston, Texas; and in Washington DC, where about 100 protesters marched from the White House to Donald Trump’s newly opened hotel several blocks away.

 “I’m very highly educated. I know words. I have the best words.”This is one of Trump’s many infamous lines that make him as quotable as Oscar Wilde - for polar opposite reasons. If only Wilde were still alive to encapsulate in one catty sentence a situation that has left the most loquacious among us dumbfounded. Just as Dolly Parton famously remarked how expensive it was to look that cheap, perhaps there’s an uncomfortable truth in this: it actually does take someone highly educated to pretend to be that stupid.Donald Trump used many rhetorical linguistic devices to tap into the raw emotions of potential voters - and it worked. In this election, every lexical rule got tossed, twisted and trumped. Here are some of the language mechanisms he used:Braggadocio Trump relied heavily on superlatives to ramp up an emotional response to his grandiose claims. Things weren’t big, they were “yuuuuuge”. He wasn’t just going to make things great again, they’d be “amazing”, “tremendous”, “the best”. He wasn’t just going to win. He was going to “win so much, you’re going to be sick and tired of winning”. It’s the aspirational language of the American dream that has, superlative by superlative, slowly transformed into a nightmare. BinariesThe divisive “us and them” rhetoric was used to full hateful effect by Trump. Either you’re part of the crusading Judeo-Christian west, or part of terrorist, destructive Islam. Either you’re a “criminal alien” or a hard-working, hard-done-by American. You’re “legal” or “illegal”. That “us and them” rhetoric of the campaign trail seemed to be diluted by the time he called for unity in his victory speech, though.HyperboleIn addition to personal boasts, Trump was prone to exaggeration and dramatisation. “The whole world is blowing up,” Trump would claim when discussing one country, Syria. When introducing Reince Priebus in his victory speech, he was described him as a “superstar” three times in two sentences - a bold claim for a man few have heard of outside the Washington bubble.EuphemismsTrump could play something down, as well as up. His most infamous euphemism, of course, was “locker room talk” - a supposed justification for admitting to “grabbing women by the pussy” without their consent.Half-finished sentences   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Trump is the master of the incomplete phraseListen to Trump in this clip. “They’re trying to justify i ... can you believe i … I have the best wo ...” This stuttering, interrupted form of speech is a hallmark of his seemingly off-the-cuff delivery. It mimics natural conversation patterns. Feeling less scripted, it has been designed to appear authentic, trustworthy and passionate, rather than scrutinised and autocued by a hundred advisers.Grammatical maturityPresidential candidate language has declined in complexity, according to a common algorithm called the Flesch-Kincaid readability test. It crunches word choice and sentence structure then gives grade-level rankings. George Washington’s language reached graduate-degree levels. Abraham Lincoln’s was 11th-grade. And Trump’s? Right down to fourth grade. Was he really saying “bigly” like a fourth grader or “big league”? The answer seems to be both.RepetitionTrump punctuates his speeches with repetition. It hammers the point home when the crowd is rambunctious and words risk getting lost. But it’s also a delaying tactic, giving him time to select his next choice of words. On his news nemesis: “That’s wrong. They were wrong. It’s The New York Times, they’re always wrong. They were wrong.” The repetition isn’t always at the end of the sentence; sometimes it’s brought to the beginning for emphasis, a technique called anaphora. “I call it extreme vetting. I call it extreme, extreme vetting.” Or even book-ending repetition in a sentence like this from his victory speech: “Tremendous potential. I’ve gotten to know our country so well — tremendous potential.”VerbsTheir most commonly used verbs revealed much about the tone of their campaigns; Clinton’s included “hope”, “support” and “try”. Trump’s were full of mansplaining and more binaries: “tell”, “lose”, “win”, and “stop”.Sexist and racist languageTrump pejoratives “bad hombres” and “nasty woman” have become so infamous that they’re already being parodied and reclaimed on merchandise.NomenclatureWhat people were called mattered more than ever in this election. What they weren’t called was even more significant: Michelle Obama’s refusal to even utter Trump’s name, while roasting him robustly, spoke volumes by declining him the dignity of an identity in her speech. Hillary’s tactic was to keep it on first name terms. Trump’s name became handy for punning purposes (“love trumps hate”) and also an aptronym, for being synonymous with a fart. Hillary’s tripartite Presidential initialism, HRC, moved her maiden name to her middle name. It’s the Rodham that said: I am my own woman, not just his wife.Unfortunately, it just wasn’t enough.Gary Nunn is a regular contributor to Mind your language @garynunn1TopicsDonald TrumpMind your languageUS elections 2016US politicscommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
An upstate New York woman, hoping to take her mind off of the US election results with a hike through the woods of Westchester County, bumped into another woman with a presumably similar notion: Hillary Clinton.Margot Gerster of White Plains wrote on Facebook that after “feeling so heartbroken since yesterday’s election”, she hoped to relax by taking her young daughter and her dog hiking on Thursday.“I decided to take them to one of favorite places in Chappaqua,” Gerster wrote, the Westchester hamlet that the Clintons call home. “We were the only ones there and it was so beautiful and relaxing.”As Gerster was ending her hike, however, she ran into a couple on the trail: the former secretary of state and her husband, former president Bill Clinton. “I heard a bit of rustling coming towards me and as I stepped into the clearing there she was, Hillary Clinton and Bill with their dogs doing exactly the same thing as I was,” Gerster wrote. “I got to hug her and talk to her and tell her that one of my most proudest moments as a mother was taking [my daughter] with me to vote for her.”Clinton was grateful for Gerster’s words, offering pleasantries, a hug and even a photo taken by the former president.“She hugged me and thanked me and we exchanged some sweet pleasantries and then I let them continue their walk,” Gerster wrote. “Now, I’m not one for signs but I think I’ll definitely take this one. So proud.”   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Hillary Clinton concession speech: ‘I know it’s painful’The photo represents Clinton’s first appearance since her concession speech on Wednesday, during which she declared: “To all the little girls who are watching this: never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.”Gerster ended her post, which has been shared nearly 3,000 times, with a series of hashtags expressing support for the former presidential candidate: “#iamstillwithher #lovetrumpshate #keepfighting #lightfollowsdarkness.”The photo has received thousands of comments, most expressing good wishes for the former candidate.“I wish I could give her a hug and thank her personally,” wrote one supporter. “And apologize for the rest of our country.”TopicsHillary ClintonUS elections 2016US politicsNew YorknewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Some of the most joyously communal jazz played in Britain over the past half-century has involved South African emigres who took refuge in Europe from the apartheid system in the 1960s and 70s. The vocalist Pinise Saul, who has died of cancer aged 71, was a powerful part of that exodus. Many consider her to be one of the greatest South African jazz singers of her generation, whose distinctive identity combined the country’s indigenous music, its vibrant black music scene of the 50s and 60s, and a love of American jazz vocalists – especially Nancy Wilson, many of whose standards Saul covered.Her formidable technique embraced methods from the Xhosa language’s percussive clicks to immensely creative jazz improvisation. She put her profound grasp of South African traditional choral harmony to eloquent use with her own South African Gospel Singers, an accomplished group drawing on Xhosa, Zulu and Sotho vocal traditions, sought after for more than 20 years after their formation in 1989. Saul considered her roles as a freedom fighter and a musician to be inseparable in the apartheid years, and often performed at fundraising African National Congress concerts.Saul was born in the Eastern Cape, to Nomini Saul, a domestic worker, and Mthuthuzeli Binase, a musician. She recalled, in a 2014 interview with London Jazz News, that she would barely have begun singing a song in her kitchen at home before the whole family joined in. In her teens, she met an influential local pianist, Tete Mbambisa, who recruited her to his vocal group, the Four Yanks, and by 1962 the group were enjoying chart hits.Mbambisa also played in a powerful instrumental group, the Jazz Wizards. Saul performed with them in a 1963 musical called Xapa Goes to Town, and she was then invited to Johannesburg to join the cast of the Zulu-language musical Back In Your Own Backyard. She remained in Johannesburg to frequent Dorkay House, a vibrant centre for African performing arts, and a cultural oasis under apartheid. Emerging South African stars including the vocalist Miriam Makeba and trumpeter Hugh Masekela often met there.In 1975, Saul joined the cast of Ipi Tombi, a dynamic black South African musical that became a hit in Europe and the US. She remained in London after the show’s West End run, and began performing with Jabula, a group whose albums were regularly banned in South Africa for their anti-apartheid lyrics. In 1979, Saul and the band participated in the Unity festival in Boston, where she sang alongside Bob Marley and Patti Labelle.Saul worked regularly with Dudu Pukwana’s groups Assegai, Spear and Zila in the 80s, and then with the guitarist Lucky Madumetja Ranku in the groups Township Express and the African Jazz Allstars. Saul was to remark that Pukwana encouraged her into instrument-like vocal experiments she might never otherwise have considered. Zila pieces also drew her into writing lyrics steeped in township life - such as those for the buoyant dance tune August One, which touched on her own family life.In 1989, the BBC invited Saul to form a singing group to feature in a TV documentary about Nelson Mandela, then about to be released from prison. A six-piece vocal group called the Progress evolved under her direction into a fully fledged choir, the South African Gospel Singers, who performed regularly at the South Bank Centre, London, for the next two decades. Saul and Lucky Ranku returned to South Africa to play a homecoming concert in East London in 1990, and she also worked with the saxophonist Trevor Watts’s percussion-centred Moire Music group. In 2001 she appeared with Ranku at the Moers festival in Germany in the US saxophone star David Murray’s African-inspired world jazz project, M’Bizo.In the 1990s, Saul and Ranku jointly ran the ensemble Township Express (a rare album credited to Saul’s leadership, Fishbone, was released in 1998), and in 2009 Saul, with others, formed the exhilarating Township Comets.Saul’s last UK gig was at The Ivy House, Peckham, in 2015, as part of the SA-UK season of London concerts. She was performing in a classy nine-piece band on new arrangements of songs from her Fishbone album. The audience were on their feet and dancing – as were Saul and her three vocal partners – for a vivacious version of Saul’s original The Girls.Saul is survived by two sons, Mongezi and BoyBoy, 11 grandchildren and a sister, Nodasi.• Pinise Saul, jazz singer, born 31 December 1944; died 26 October 2016TopicsJazzSouth AfricaAfricaHugh MasekelaobituariesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
How did we get President-Elect Donald Trump? For years both political parties were busy making promises but had no intention of keeping them. It took a mob-mentality man to wake us up.

Labour, be warned!Gillian MaherCuckfield, West Sussex• You report that Bill Clinton disparagingly referred to Jeremy Corbyn as being selected as Labour leader because he was “the maddest person in the room” (Report, 9 November).

Theresa May has congratulated Donald Trump on his US presidential election victory, as the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and his Lib Dem counterpart, Tim Farron, expressed deep unease at the result.Nicola Sturgeon has urged Donald Trump to prove that he can act for all US citizens regardless of their heritage after his surprise victory in the US presidential elections.David Davis has pledged to share the Westminster government’s “latest thinking” on Brexit with the leaderships of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, before the first meeting of a forum intended to allow the devolved administrations to help shape Britain’s strategy.Two families who claimed that the bedroom tax, which restricts housing subsidies, was unfair have won their appeals against the UK government at the supreme court.Amnesty International has criticised a UK trade minister for travelling to Qatar to seek contracts for British companies ahead of the 2022 World Cup without apparently highlighting the human rights abuses faced by migrant workers building venues for the event.That’s all from me for today.Thanks for the comments. What will or should Donald Trump’s presidency mean for the UK? Here are three good articles that address this.Jeremy Cliffe at the Economist says a Trump presidency will make Brexit harder. A single theme unifies these risks. Brexit is a giant shock to Britain’s place in the world. It will sever old links and require new ones to be forged. As some of its keenest proponents concede, this transition will bring painful costs. Most of all it demands lots of good will and flexibility on all sides. In so far as Mr Trump’s win means a meaner, more fractious, more volatile global order, it raises those costs and shrinks that space for compromise and consensus essential for a smooth Brexit.Limiting the damage of a Trump presidency on a Brexiting Britain demands ambition and perspective from Mrs May. Her approach should be two-sided. First, build a new, closer alliance with Angela Merkel, not just on Brexit but on wider issues: the world economy, security, Russia and China. In Berlin and other European capitals officials complain that June’s referendum result has taken Britain’s mind off all other matters. The prime minister must not allow that to happen and instead work with Mrs Merkel as a bloc capable of countering Mr Trump’s worst traits.Second, Mrs May should use Britain’s influence in America (which is significant, if not as much as Britons like to imagine) to attempt to moderate the new president, staying his hand when he does wrong and indulging his vanity when he does right. Mrs May already had her hands full with Brexit. Now, for Britain’s sake and that of the world, she must also deal with Mr Brexit himself.Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger in Europe, at the New Statesman looks at what the left can learn from the Trump and Brexit victories. A new politics is necessary, one with the seeds of dignity. We must find our way to a prosperity which gives people a greater sense of belonging; where communities have more autonomy to judge their own affairs, and where international cooperation is used to tackle the worst excesses of globalisation, including tax avoidance, human trafficking and illegal immigration.So, too, do we need a new language of politics – one that refuses to pander to prejudice but recognises that what the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls the “moral octaves” which those on the left cannot hear. For example, imagine that there are concentric circles of loyalty – family, community, country - which are not just a comfort blanket in times of crises, but are hardwired into us as human beings.From this perspective, overt displays of patriotism which may make liberals uncomfortable can in fact be harnessed, and used to reinforce positive values. Larry Summers, an academic and former adviser to Barack Obama, has called it “responsible nationalism” which “starts from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximise the welfare of citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good”.Bill Emmott at CapX asks if the special relationship can survive. We cannot know in advance how protectionist the US is going to become. But we can know that Britain, as a trading nation wanting to buy and sell freely with the whole world, is likely to be a loser if protectionism really does become the flavour of the era.At least the traditionally close relationship between our intelligence services and those of America can still be depended upon. But it is not going to be a comfortable or predictable ride.Theresa May and Boris Johnson had better mean it when they say that post-Brexit Britain will have a great new partnership with our European friends and neighbours. We’re going to need it. Tom Raines, a researcher at Chatham House, the foreign policy thinktank, has posted an interesting thread on Twitter about the implications of Donald Trump’s win for UK foreign policy.He implicitly defends Theresa May’s decision not to express any reservations about Trump today.

A Ukip spokesman said Farage would not be speaking to the press in Spain and was due to fly to Miami later in the day. But Farage has issued this statement. Today, the establishment is in deep shock. Even more so than after Brexit. What we are witnessing is the end of a period of big business and big politics controlling our lives. Voters across the Western world want nation state democracy, proper border controls and to be in charge of their own lives. I commend Donald Trump for the courage with which he has fought this campaign and I look forward to a closer relationship between the USA and the UK.We now have a president who likes our country and understands our post-Brexit values. Prepare for further political shocks in the years to come.  Nigel Farage speaking to the media outside the US presidential election night party at the US Embassy last night. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Conservative MP Andrew Percy, minister for the Northern powerhouse, described Trump’s victory as “a glorious moment for democracy.”Speaking at an event organised by Marketing Lancashire at Burnley football club on Wednesday, Percy was revelling in the US election result, explaining: We’ve just had this massive election and it’s great to see so many people have turned out to vote in what is the greatest democracy in the planet, just to see the enthusiasm with which people have gone to the polls. Alex Salmond, the former Scottish first minister who has had dealings with Donald Trump because his administration approved plans for Trump’s golf course near Aberdeen, told Sky News that he was “deeply disappointed” by Trump’s election. He said he hoped being president changed Trump. Trump could be “nice as ninepence” when he was getting his own way, Salmond said. But the electoral campaign showed what he could be like when he was facing opposition.Sky News (@SkyNews)"I'm deepy disappointed" says @theSNP MP @AlexSalmond about the #USelection2016 result #Trump https://t.co/By1rTdb7fENovember 9, 2016 Government departments have form for using big news events, like the US presidential election, as cover for the release of potentially embarrassing information. And today, true to form, departments are releasing information about the ministers’ and special advisers’ meetings, gifts and hospitality.I have not gone through the releases, but I will let you know if anything good crops up. Theresa May, the prime minister, has recorded a clip for the broadcasters about Donald Trump’s election. She essentially just read out, with minor changes, the statement she issued earlier. (See 9.43am.) It was not an interview, but she did take one question on Trump.The reporter asked May if she thought Trump was a fit person to be president, given what he said in the campaign about Muslims and about his plans. And would May be able to work with him? She replied: Yes, I look forward to working with President-elect Trump. The American people have elected him as the next president of the United States. Britain and the United States share values of freedom and democracy and enterprise. And I look forward to building on the special relationship we have between our two countries to ensure the security and prosperity of our two nations in the future. By contrast, when Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, commented on Trump’s election earlier today, she managed to combine an ostensibly friendly message of support with an implicit rebuke to Trump for the stance he took during the campaign on matters like equality, diversity and the rule of law (ie, not torturing people).Stewart Wood (@StewartWood)Sober, dignified & principled statement on the US election result from the new leader of the free world, Angela Merkel. pic.twitter.com/dCjqGsJ1HUNovember 9, 2016The contrast is quite striking: Merkel sent out a signal that she would be willing to challenge Trump in defence of some of the key values of European democracy; May didn’t.That doesn’t mean May may doesn’t feel just as strongly about equality etc as Merkel. She most probably does. But she has evidently decided that is not in her or the UK’s interests to go public on these concerns at this stage. That is not particularly surprising, given the obsession successive British governments have had with maintaining close ties with Washington, but May could find that on this she is out of step with public opinion.  Theresa May. Photograph: Sky News The North East of Scotland is famous for its parochial newspaper headlines. Most journalists have heard the story about how the Aberdeen Journal covered the sinking of the Titanic under the headline “North-east man lost at sea”, even though recent research established that it never used those words and that this is just a journalist myth.Anyway, myth or otherwise, the tradition continues. Here is the lead story on the Buchan Observer website. (I’m grateful to pandapaws BTL for the tip.)  Headline. Photograph: Buchan Observer This is from Paul Nuttall, favourite in the Ukip leadership contest.Paul Nuttall (@paulnuttallukip)Congratulations to Donald Trump - President elect. His acceptance speech was a measured call for unity. Bodes well for the future.November 9, 2016 In a post on his blog Douglas Carswell, Ukip’s only MP, claims Donald Trump’s policy platform is much more centrist than people think. Carswell, who is much more liberal and pro-immigration than Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, says he thinks Trump could end up persuading Congress to adopt a New Deal-style, big government agenda.Here’s an extract. In his acceptance speech, the President-elect talked about new infrastructure spending, creating new jobs. That idea is reminiscent of the 1930s – in America, that is. It harks back to FDR’s New Deal.Indeed, throughout the campaign, Trump has drawn policies from both left and right. He has taken protectionism from the Democrats, and a tougher stance on immigration from the Republicans. He has attacked political correctness, but, at the same time, ignored much of the socially conservative culture war. He has pledged to cut taxes, but not to cut welfare.That might explain how Trump has managed to do what no other Republican presidential candidate has done since the 1980s: run the table across the so-called Rust Belt states.The danger is that, having promised change, Trump’s presidency just brings more of the same. Borrowing to fund infrastructure and entitlements will come at a huge long-term cost. Statist stimulus doesn’t usually produce the kind of sustainable economic boom Trump has promised. At least, it didn’t for FDR. Or, for that matter, Obama.But the irony is that, after years of gridlock between the President and Congress, it could be the man Democrats despise more than any other who enables bipartisanship. With Trump in the White House, Republicans in Congress may end up backing a big-government agenda similar to the one they have trenchantly opposed for much of the last eight years.

Joe Root has long accepted the expectation that comes with being England’s top batsman and, after his opening day hundred against India, hoped a message has been sent to his team-mates that they too can thrive in this Test series.Speaking after England reached 311 for four at stumps, Root revealed a personal satisfaction at bringing up his first three-figure score on the subcontinent but also the belief he and Moeen Ali, who was unbeaten on 99, will have given the squad in their stand of 179.Joe Root and Moeen Ali drive England on day one of first Test against India Read more“It’s a nice start to this series and it’s something to build on now,” said Root, whose 124 was his 11th Test century. “The way me and Mo played – without blowing my own trumpet – was something that, going forward, will give us confidence and the rest of the guys as well.“Pressure is always there as senior batters. You are expected to score runs and you have to get on with it and learn to deal with it. To bat for that long at the start of this trip really pleasing.“I just tried to be quite positive with my footwork, get right forward and right back, use my feet at times and – when it was available – use the sweep shot, try to make it hard for them to settle on one line and length.“With a partner at the other end also playing quite freely, with the board ticking over all the time and a right and left-hander, it was very difficult for India to build any pressure.”Root was also sanguine about his dismissal in the evening session after the on-field officials and the third umpire, Rod Tucker, were satisfied Umesh Yadav had control of a caught and bowled despite fumbling the ball when trying to throw it up in celebration.He said: “I was so disgusted with the shot that – giving it the Arsène Wenger approach – I didn’t really see what was happening. Having seen the slo-mo replay since, it does look out. Full speed it looks a bit strange but I was very lucky to get an umpire’s call with an lbw earlier and you have to take the rough with the smooth and just get on with it.”Fortune helps England gain first Test foothold but Kohli’s India can fire back | Ali Martin Read moreOn the match situation, Root claimed a total in excess of 500 is well within England’s reach on a pitch he thinks will rapidly deteriorate; that the India seamers, Umesh Yadav and the cramp-afflicted Mohammed Shami, were getting the ball reverse swing was also a boon.Root said: “Our seamers will take a lot of pleasure in seeing it reverse-swing after 35 overs, and those three guys will be looking forward to having a big score on the board to defend and give them opportunities to be aggressive.“If we can get beyond 500 that will be a fantastic effort. It will be more about how long we can bat on this wicket. By the end of day two, three and into day four, the game will speed up drastically in my opinion.“I might be completely wrong but having spent some time out there and seen the cracks on the wicket – and already the variable bounce it’s shown – it might go into fast-forward come day three onwards. So it will be really important to make big scores tomorrow and take advantage of this really good start.”TopicsJoe RootEngland cricket teamEngland in India 2016-17India cricket teamCricketnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Here’s an overview of where we are this morning:Donald Trump has won the presidency in a stunning upset that surprised pollsters and media alike.Hillary Clinton called Trump to concede the election shortly after Wisconsin was called for the Republican candidate, sealing his victory.The former secretary of state did not make a concession speech, instead she allowed advisor John Podesta to tell the crowd at her party in New York’s Javits Center to go home. She’s expected to make a concession speech this morning.In his victory speech, Trump called for unity, praising Clinton for a hard-fought campaign and saying “Now it is time for America to heal the wounds of division.”Oakland, New York, Los Angeles and Washington DC have seen anti-Trump protests overnight, burning Trump effigies and smashing a window at the Oakland Tribune.The Republicans won big all round - maintaining and strengthening its control of the Senate 51-47 after wins in Florida, Pennsylvania and Indiana. Congress also remains Republican controlled 236-191.Asian stocks and the US dollar dropped after news of a likely Trump win - and bounced back slightly overnight, but all eyes on the market this morning. This live blog is now closed. Please join us over at our new campaign live blog, where we’ll be covering the fallout from the election all day.Donald Trump wins US election: the world reacts – live Read more Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, reacted to Trump’s win by saying that it would not change the trajectory of his country’s foreign policy and that the US’s credibility among the international community had already diminished, reports Saeed Kamali Dehghan.  “The US election results will have no impact on the policies of the Islamic Republic,” the Iranian cleric said during a Wednesday meeting with his cabinet, according to the semi-official Isna news agency. “Because of wrong policies, the position of America in the international community and world’s public opinion has diminished and [the US’s] growing rift with Europe and the world will exacerbate that position.” The country’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, meanwhile, said that the US had to continue respecting last year’s landmark nuclear agreement, whose fate rests much in the hands of the new American president. “America has to implement the international obligation it accepted under the nuclear deal,” he was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency while on an official visit to Romania. Earlier on Wednesday, a spokesman for Iran’s atomic energy agency said that Tehran would continue abiding by the nuclear accord despite Trump’s win. Tasnim cited Behrouz Kamalvandi as saying that “Iran is prepared for all kind of change” and that the country “would continue implementing the Barjam,” Iranian acronym of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or the final nuclear accord.Tasnim, which is affiliated to the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guards, saw Donald Trump’s win as a vindication for the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said last week that the American businessman appeared to be the one saying the truth about the state of affairs in the US. Referring to Trump, Khamenei said last week: “What is interesting is that the person who spoke more candidly attracted more attention from the people of America. Because that man spoke more candidly and more openly, the people of America paid more attention to him. The other party [Clinton’s camp] said that he is adopting a populist method. Why populist? It is because the people were watching him and they saw that what he was saying was correct. They saw it in the realities of their life. Human values have been annihilated and trampled upon in that country. There is racial discrimination in that country.”Fouad Izadi, a political analyst sympathetic to the conservative camp in Iran, said Trump’s presidency would be better for Iran than that of Clinton’s. “The only advantage of having Trump over Clinton in regards to Iran is that he would have much more difficulties in bringing together the international community in order to make obstacles for Iran,” he told Tasnim. Analysts such as Izadi think that pressure on Iran in the past was because Obama had managed to persuade the US’s European allies to rally behind Washington in imposing sanctions on Iran. They think Trump lacks the credibility to do so in case the nuclear deal falls apart. Donald Trump has updated his Twitter bio to reflect his new position:  Trump’s Twitter bio Photograph: Twitter Jeremy Corbyn MP, leader of the Labour Party in the UK, gave the following statement:  Many in Britain and elsewhere will be understandably shocked by Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election, the rhetoric around it and what the election result means for the rest of the world, as well as America.Trump’s election is an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply isn’t working for most people. It is one that has delivered escalating inequality and stagnating or falling living standards for the majority, both in the US and Britain.This is a rejection of a failed economic consensus and a governing elite that has been seen not to have listened. And the public anger that has propelled Donald Trump to office has been reflected in political upheavals across the world. But some of Trump’s answers to the big questions facing America, and the divisive rhetoric around them, are clearly wrong. I have no doubt, however, that the decency and common sense of the American people will prevail, and we send our solidarity to a nation of migrants, innovators and democrats.After this latest global wake up call, the need for a real alternative to a failed economic and political system could not be clearer. That alternative must be based on working together, social justice and economic renewal, rather than sowing fear and division. And the solutions we offer have to improve the lives of everyone, not pit one group of people against another.Americans have made their choice. The urgent necessity is now for us all to work across continents to tackle our common global challenges: to secure peace, take action on climate change and deliver economic prosperity and justice. This is the moment CNN’s Van Jones called Trump’s victory a “whitelash” against America’s first black president: Trump victory a ‘whitelash’ against a black president, says CNN’s Van Jones – video After an initial panic, the financial markets are coming to terms with Donald Trump’s shock victory, reports the Guardian’s Graeme Wearden. Trump’s call for America to “come together as one united people” has provided some comfort to shell-shocked investors. They are hoping that the president elect, after running such a divisive campaign, may be planning to soften his rhetoric.Britain’s main stock index, the FTSE 100, has recovered from an early-morning slump and is now flat.Losses are expected on Wall Street when trading begins in four hours time. The futures market says the Dow will fall by around 300 points, or nearly 2%. That’s a significant drop, but not the 800-point plunge we expected when the shock results rolled in last night.The dollar also recovered some ground after Trump pledged to create “the strongest economy in the world” and is now down 0.5% against a basket of currencies. The Mexican peso has also struggled back off the mat, after hitting a record low overnight.Ultimately, investors had expected Hillary Clinton to win - so they’re now scrambling to work out what Trump’s victory is going to mean for the US economy, global trade and geopolitical stability.Kathleen Brooks of City Index, a financial spread-betting firm, says:“It is worth remembering that Trump started a “movement”, now he has to turn that into a political machine capable of ruling. We won’t know if he can be successful until he actually takes office in January.For now, this is a strange day, politically and financially. We have suffered a massive political shock, but the markets are wondering if President Trump is less of a threat to America’s economy in office, compared to what he was during the campaign.” Some more pictures of the protests against Trump’s presidential victory which are developing this evening in California and Oregon:David DeBolt (@daviddebolt).@Uber new HQ in background.

More and more women could be seen crying on one another’s shoulders, while one group of women (and a couple of male friends) gave the middle finger to CNN’s Jake Tapper on the large screen.Tempestt Morgan – still hoping against hope for a Clinton victory at 12:30am – wasn’t actually optimistic about the America into which she’d be entering as a college graduate next May. “Even if [Clinton] somehow makes it back from this, it’s still sad to see so many people aligned with a candidate like [Trump]” she said, referencing his comments about women and people of color.Her friend, Jekia Brockman, looked around at the women crying – one of whom flopped over dramatically as yet another state was said to be leaning Trump – and said: “It’s not ‘unbelievable’. It’s completely believable.” How it all unfolded: How the 2016 US election night unfolded Women in suits, mothers and daughters, hucksters selling “Nasty Women” pins and tens of thousands of members of the public came to Manhattan’s largest glass ceiling on Tuesday night, to await the result of a presidential election that many hoped would sweep away the highest gender barrier in US politics.As the night went on and results did not go the Democrats’ way, the mood in and around the building grew darker, reports the Guardian’s Lauren Gambino from Clinton’s election-night party in New York. Inside, Clinton was supposed to speak on a stage constructed in the shape of the United States, her podium positioned somewhere over Texas, a deep red state that would stay that way despite a nationwide increase in the Hispanic vote that had fuelled hopes of turning it purple, if not Democratic blue. American flags lined the stage. The pledge of allegiance was said, the national anthem played.Thunderous cheers rang off that glass ceiling as newscasters announced that Clinton had won Illinois, the state where she was born. States came and went, largely as expected: Delaware, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island for Clinton, South Carolina, Alabama and more for Trump. But things were predictably close in Florida, and as Trump surged back into contention tension rose at the Javits.In the early hours of the morning, not long before the race was called and Clinton conceded, campaign chairman John Podesta took the stage to ask supporters if they could hang a little while longer.“I can say we can wait a little longer can’t we?” Podesta said. “They’re still counting votes and every vote should count. Several states are too close to call, so we’re not going to have anything more to say tonight.”Supporters made a teary exit. Mothers carried weary daughters out of the glass structure that in the end hosted shattered hopes, not broken barriers.“What just happened,” Gloria Lowell asked, shaking her head. She repeated the question. A man turned around and raised his beer.“We lost,” he said. “We lost and it hurts.” The pair of strangers embraced.   John Podesta Calls An End To Hillary Clinton Presidential Campaign Photograph: UPI / Barcroft ImagesYou can read the whole piece here. British Prime Minister Theresa May has released a statement congratulating Trump on his victory in the presidential election. She said: I would like to congratulate Donald Trump on being elected the next President of the United States, following a hard-fought campaign.Britain and the United States have an enduring and special relationship based on the values of freedom, democracy and enterprise.We are, and will remain, strong and close partners on trade, security and defence.I look forward to working with President-elect Donald Trump, building on these ties to ensure the security and prosperity of our nations in the years ahead. We’ve been gathering views on the mood in the US. Here, a group of American readers tell us what they think.Susan Hall from Illinois sent in her response, saying: “A long hard fought campaign. I am very proud of our new president and vice president. The message shared has set the right tone for his presidency. It’s time to now begin the hard work and healing of our nation. I understand there are many feeling uneasy right now. I think if they keep an open mind and open arms, the US can come together like never before. The future is what we decide to make it at this point. “Woody from Washington was similarly excited, declaring it a victory for average Americans.  I voted for Obama twice, and really he should go down as one of the worst presidents in history. Obamacare is a disaster, our ability to project our strength in the world has diminished. We have become more divided as a nation under his guidance. Hillary would only have expanded on his failures. We saw scandal after scandal when Bill was in the Oval Office. She should have been prosecuted for her illegal server and lied under oath. She would have expanded immigration causing unrest like we are seeing in Europe at this moment.The Supreme Court will have several openings and Trump will appoint nominees who will preserve our constitution and bill of rights. More than anything I am so relieved Hillary didn’t win as I don’t trust her.Others were much less enthusiastic. Anton Prosser from Texas said he felt bad when George W. Bush was elected, but he’s never felt afraid until now.  I’m trans, and I’m worried about what will happen to me in this America now. If the courts will see challenges to every bit of equality for LGBT+ Americans. I’m scared that if I attempt to legally transition, my marriage could be invalidated or my health care taken away if we lose the few protections we have. I’m scared to use a bathroom in any public place, because I never know if strangers see me as a man or a woman. I’m scared of what could happen to all of us.You can share your pictures, videos and perspectives on the election result by clicking on the blue ‘Contribute’ button at the top and bottom of the live blog or by using the form here.
For the tabloids, one story has trumped the US presidential choice: Prince Harry’s romance with an American actor, Meghan Markle.And newspapers were anything but pleased about the prince’s advisers daring to issue a public statement accusing them of misbehaviour. What? Us? Don’t blame us, guv. How very dare you! We were just fulfilling the people’s right to know what the fifth in line to the throne is up to. It is a matter of public interest.Aware, however, that the public’s interest is always tempered by hypocrisy – leave the guy alone but do please tell us more – editors were careful to echo that humbug in their responses.Prince Harry attacks press over 'wave of abuse' of girlfriend Meghan Markle Read moreSo here are the opening sentences to Wednesday’s leading articles: “Anyone who has been in love will understand Prince Harry’s urge to protect his girlfriend…” (Daily Mail)“Prince Harry is a decent bloke whose heart is in the right place. His new girlfriend Meghan Markle is a breath of fresh air who we’d love to see become a regular fixture of life at Kensington Palace…” (The Sun)“Decent people everywhere will wish Prince Harry well in love, and his desire to protect American girlfriend Meghan Markle is both admirable and understandable…” (Daily Mirror)You can sense the “buts” that follow. And here they are:Mail: “But where, oh where, were the wise courtiers who should have advised the headstrong prince against issuing such an emotional, blanket condemnation of the media?”Sun: But “Harry’s attack on the media for ‘crossing the line’ was ill-judged”.Mirror: But “scrutiny comes with the job when you’re a royal”.Anyway, we’re innocent of all charges. We have rules and stick to them. It was that nasty US media wot dunnit along with irresponsible social media users.The Mail said it did not “defend anyone who may have breached the strict code of practice governing the British press”.Nor does the Sun: “The UK press isn’t to blame for his most serious allegations. The Sun abides by strict rules against intrusion and harassment – and we agree Meghan shouldn’t be hounded.”In fact, according to the Mirror, it is time for Facebook and Twitter to deal with the “poisonous sexist and racist abuse” by “trolls spewing bile”.The Daily Express, in welcoming “the news of the prince’s relationship with a beautiful and talented young woman”, said: “Trolling on social media … is nothing to do with responsible media outlets such as this newspaper.”That said, Harry “needs to get real”, argued the Sun. “Media attention is unavoidable. When a prince falls for a glamorous American TV star, interest is bound to explode worldwide.” The Mail agreed:  The public has a legitimate interest in the life story of a woman romantically connected to the son of our future king – a woman who has herself assiduously courted publicity to promote her commercial interest. Indeed, there is a worrying tendency, particularly among the young royals, to expect all the advantages that go with their birth, while at the same time wanting to enjoy the privacy afforded to those of the Queen’s subjects who have to work nine-to-five for a living.Sun columnist Jane Moore thought the prince should “develop a thicker skin in a modern world that prays at the altar of all things celebrity”.And the Mail’s columnist, Sarah Vine, thought it preposterous for publicity hungry Markle to claim she is a hapless victim: “You live by Instagram, you die by Instagram.”As for Harry, she surmised that despite his life of “unbelievable privilege” he was seeking “exactly the same privacy [as] the humblest dweller of the humblest bungalow”.The Times took a somewhat similar view: “It is inconceivable that a relationship between a popular British prince, who is fifth in line to the throne, and a beautiful American actress is of no interest to the public and the press.” It thought Kensington Palace had taken a “remarkable step” by criticising press coverage. Why had the royal household not foreseen the likely level of interest?Having conceded that “invasive paparazzi hounding” had been a contributory factor to the death of Harry’s mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, the Times returned to its criticism of royal aides.“It would have been wise of the palace to have warned her that she would be the subject of intense public and media interest.”The Guardian reminded readers of the detail from the statement: journalists had tried to enter Markle’s home, her ex-boyfriend had been offered bribes and her mother had been harassed by photographers.The tabloids, it said, “are at their old game again … deliberately confusing what is in the public interest with what is interesting to the public”.Having survived the Leveson process relatively unscathed, editorial confidence at the Mail and the Sun “is soaring”. Their editors feel “liberated” and the misfortune for the couple is “that news of their relationship has broken just as the tabloids are relishing their renewed sense of impunity”.With Harry deemed to be “fair game for the kind of press behaviour that was supposed never to happen again”, the Guardian calls on the Independent Press Standards Organisation to show “that it is ready to prove its worth”.TopicsMediaGreensladeNational newspapersDaily MailThe SunDaily MirrorDaily ExpressblogpostsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Who do we blame?The Democrats, who picked a flawed candidate in Hillary Clinton?The Clintons, who have acted like the White House is their birthright?The Republican party, which lost control of its base?The media, which created a false equivalence between a former secretary of state and a reality TV star?Wall Street, which comprehensively screwed ordinary Americans out of their homes and their jobs?The US has elected its most dangerous leader. We all have plenty to fear | Jonathan Freedland Read morePolitical leaders, who have failed to manage the negative impacts of globalisation and the “new economy”?James Comey, the FBI director who intervened in a most dramatic fashion in the election campaign?The Russians, for hacking and releasing the Democratic party’s emails?Donald Trump, who lied, insulted and bullied his way into office?The millions of Americans who let fear and hate trump optimism?Frankly, all of the above.The Democratic party should have woken up as to how flawed a candidate Clinton was once non-Democratic party member and ageing socialist Bernie Sanders emerged as an existential threat to her candidacy.The Clintons – so renowned for supposed political nous – seemed to completely miss that they represented the ultimate insiders and political establishment in an era of outsiders and anti-establishment. If the Clintons really cared about their political party and their country, they should have understood that Hillary was the wrong candidate for the times and stood aside.Hillary Clinton has been a polarising and unpopular figure in American politics for decades. I was never excited by her candidacy. I never believed Americans would vote for her – until Donald Trump became her opponent.A bloviating idiot, a misogynistic fool, a racist, narcissistic reality TV star without a singular achievement to his name? Surely Americans would back a former secretary of state over him – even if she was Hillary Clinton.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  How the 2016 US election night unfoldedHow the hell did the Republican party – the party of Reagan’s “Morning in America”, of George HW Bush’s “1000 points of light”, of George W Bush’s compassionate conservationism, and the party of religious evangelicals – how did this party get behind such an utterly awful human being? The Republican party leadership is largely to blame – they created and fed their party base with promises of lower taxes, balanced budgets and smaller government, and then for years delivered the opposite. They relied on the outrage media (Fox News, Rush Limbaugh) during the Clinton and Obama years to fuel anger – until that anger grew beyond their reach.And let’s not forget the media. They are now clearly part of the elite – well and truly. Not one major newspaper endorsed Trump. Their readers – if people are still reading newspapers – didn’t care about their endorsements.And American television networks – from the earliest days of the Republican primaries – have amplified and uncritically analysed Trump’s every tweet, insult and fact-free assertion. They treated Trump’s behaviour and Clinton’s record as equivalent. The media followed the personality and not the policy, and in doing so, they gave birth to America’s first megalomaniac, celebrity president.As Trump’s electoral college numbers grew on election day, the share markets went into free fall. Sadly the economic impact of that downturn doesn’t fall solely on Wall Street, but it would be good if it did. The banks have never worn the consequences of their greed and destruction: the banks left the mortgage holders and middle class to suffer as they took the bailouts and the benefits of being too big too fail. Meanwhile the political leadership on both sides pushed free trade and the “new economy” for years without understanding that the new economy sounds scary, and for lots of people, it is scary as their jobs disappear. This is hardly a new phenomenon – in 1992, Ross Perot labelled Nafta the “giant sucking sound to the south” that would draw manufacturing jobs to Mexico. Billy Joel’s Allentown and Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA sang the psalms of this disempowerment. (Who thought Billy Joel would one day be seen as a politically prophetic voice?) Yes, the polls were wrong. Here's why | Mona Chalabi Read moreIn this campaign, Donald Trump said China and Mexico were stealing American manufacturing jobs and he was going to steal them back. That Trump’s pledges were without detail and beyond the power of the American president was pointless – he was just relentless in repeating what the political elite had ignored: Americans were losing the chance to earn a living.And for all the talk of a “rigged” election – well, it came close. FBI director James Comey deserves special mention, as do the Russians for trying to influence the election. However, the margin of Trump’s victory and his results in places like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania shows that the entire blame for this result cannot be sheeted home to these interventions.It is often said that the voters don’t get it wrong.Did they? Can we blame them for giving into fear, hate and division?Should we mock them for electing the biggest joke to occupy the Oval Office?No.The American voters got their diagnosis of the problems right. But their solution – Donald Trump – it’s hard to see anything right about that.

1 Film school doesn’t have all the answersThe jury is still out on whether film school is the best way to break into the industry. Producer Michael Berliner never went to film school and had “basically zero knowledge” of the industry when he started out. Making a low budget film and finding a mentor can help you pick up the formal processes and technical skills that you might learn in film school. “Be prepared to face some hard work and a steep learning curve,” Berliner says. Tips on breaking into film – live chat Read moreScreenwriter Rob Sprackling also knew nothing about the technical aspects of film when he started his career. He says film school is “extremely helpful” for pursuing technical skills, like editing. But for more general skills, such as screenwriting, “it is probably less so”. Rather than spending money on film school, move to Los Angeles, says former agent and film career mentor Paul Duddridge. He recommends students pursue academic courses at university if possible, while moonlighting in the creative arts to build a network. Although film school is not for everyone, it does have certain advantages, such as introducing you to contacts and offering forums to showcase your work, says Brian Ward, head of screenwriting at the National Film and Television School (NFTS). He recommends initiatives such as the British Film Institute Academy, a training scheme for 16- 19-year-olds. Carlos Ciudad, VFX production supervisor/senior production manager and NFTS graduate, agrees that film school helped his career off the ground. “I can assure you it’s worth the investment,” he says. 2 Consider different types of jobs in the industry Research, research, research – find out about the different job roles out there.Kay VerdonWhile roles such as writer, director and producer are the big draws, prospective film workers should understand the wide variety of roles in the industry, says Kay Verdon, careers manager at Creative Skillset. “Research, research, research – find out about the different job roles out there,” she says.Exploring less obvious roles in film – such as in the art department, costume, sound, locations – is a good route into the industry, agrees Nicola Lees, agent and career mentor. This is how she built her career in film. “I love writing, but found my niche in writing proposals for TV programmes rather than screenwriting. That brought me a regular income, the opportunity to dip into lots of interesting worlds, and also sit at the table with commissioning editors in pitch sessions, which was an amazing experience.” She adds that there is a shortage of production accountants and location managers. Learning to drive should also be a priority for aspiring filmmakers, as roles often involve travelling across the country. 3 Build a portfolio of workEight tips on starting a career in film and TV Read more“The easiest way to get into the industry is to make something. Anything,” says Duddridge. “Just start. Shoot anything at all, even on your phone. Even the edit software is included in your laptop.” Then enter your film into every film festival you can find, he adds. “I’m a huge fan of high-concept, low-budget as an attention getter.” Berliner has a nifty tip for aspiring film-makers looking to produce high-quality work on a tight budget: shoot something at an off-peak time of year like January, when the equipment houses have spare cameras sitting around. But it is worth remembering that content will always trump production values, says Berliner. 4 Make connections and collaborateAttending networking events, like those hosted by organisations such as Shooting People and Creative England, is a good way to make industry connections. But this can also be done online. Duddridge suggests trawling through the film and TV listings site IMDb to find contact details of producers and directors. “Offer your services as an assistant or a cheap pair of hands. You will get a bite,” he says.Breaking into the TV industry, take one Read moreStay in touch with people your own age who have the same ambitions as you, says Niyi Akeju, PR and learning campaigns manager at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta). “They could be your future collaborators. We often find that up-and-coming craftspeople have collaborated with those at the same experience level as themselves to get their first breaks,” she says. Sites such as Hiive, LinkedIn and Twitter are also useful online networking tools for the film industry. When connecting with people, it is important to showcase what value you can add to a project. “Don’t ask for a job, ask for advice,” recommends Ciudad. Finding a mentor who is experienced, but not necessarily a big name in the industry, is helpful, says Berliner. “That way, they’re not so distanced from the kind of work that you’re doing that they’re unable to advise you properly. But because they have been around the block before, they’ll have learned things through trial and error, and can hopefully help stop you from treading into the same rabbit holes.”Making friends with third assistant directors is also a good tactic, he adds, because they are the ones who hire runners. Once you have credits for short films under your belt, the next step is to get junior positions on big productions.  Offer your services as an assistant or cheap pair of hands. You will get a bite.Paul Duddridge5 Should I get an agent?“Having an agent can’t hurt but speaking as a former agent, you really don’t need one,” says Duddridge. When you immerse yourself in creative projects, agents will appear “as if from nowhere”, he says.The decision to work with an agent boils down to personal choice and your skillset. People who are good self-publicists and have a vision of where they are heading do not necessarily need an agent, says Berliner. But “fantastically creative people who do not have the skills or interest to self-promote themselves effectively” should probably get one. But before going down the agent route focus on getting a few projects under your belt.Looking for a job?

Claiming this will better enable those on benefits to find work adds insult to injury, and implies that the main barrier to employment is personal laziness rather than the lack of secure, adequately remunerated employment. Research finds that benefit cuts and sanctions actually make it harder to find work by adding stress and hassle to those already desperately trying to make ends meet. It will save a piffling £100m a year, yet will prove counterproductive as higher costs are put on to local authorities dealing with consequent homelessness, will add to NHS costs in greater sickness rates, and will damage educational prospects for the children affected. Can the government not join the dots when carrying out these moves? Or is personal misery and economic cost unimportant in its ideological drive?Michael MillerSheffield• Even people who are in work on low pay can claim benefits. According to the government benefits calculator, if I were a single person with two children living in my borough of Haringey and earning the £23,000 a year that is the benefit cap, I could claim over £4,000 in child tax credit and almost £12,000 a year in housing benefit. Admittedly I would be paying about £4,000 a year on tax and national insurance, and £1,300 a year on council tax, but I would still find it hard to make ends meet. Still, I would be considerably better off than a similar family, in similar circumstances, under this inhumane benefit cap. Of course I could always look for work but unfortunately there are not many jobs going in Haringey that pay £23,000 a year. As for the possibility of a three-bedroom flat at £12,000 a year, according to Rightmove they don’t exist.Louise LewisLondon• Regarding Larry Elliot’s article on the report by Christina Beatty and Steve Fothergill on welfare, work and austerity (Report, 7 November), we have just completed our own research on Devolution and Disadvantage in the Sheffield City Region, which can be viewed as a case study of a severely deindustrialised area of the north comprising South Yorkshire and north-east Derbyshire, former coal and steel communities.Our study findings are similar to Fothergill and Beatty, though we focus in more detail on two areas and these need to be fed into this very important debate on the nature and consequences of deindustrialisation in Britain. First, the nature of labour market disadvantage is complex and relates to a variety of groups such as women, young people and BAME people, as well as those on long-term sickness and disability benefits.The second area we explore is devolution policies and here we argue that the devolution deals and agreements are closely linked to austerity policies and the various cuts (some of these being welfare-rated). While the devolution deal for the Sheffield city region financially involves £900m over 30 years (subject of course to an elected mayor and other milestones), we have found that cuts to welfare and local authority budgets between 2010 and 2014 amounted to £1.1bn. As outlined in the article and report, the welfare cuts in no way actually contribute to raising employment rates. In reality, austerity is contributing to increased personal and family impoverishment and debt. It is also seriously undermining the city-regional growth model trumpeted as the “northern powerhouse”. This is because of the distortions to the labour market through increasing segmentation, which welfare conditionality actually creates.This means that the actual impact of policies is that a more limited cohort of labour can access skills and apprenticeships, which is deemed as essential to devolution growth strategies. So, we would certainly welcome widening this important debate.Dr David Etherington Middlesex University Professor Martin Jones University of Sheffield• The cuts to social security entitlements that Polly Toynbee describes (May’s ‘just managing’ are the victims of this new benefit cap, 8 November) bring shame on us all for having let our once cherished system of welfare fall into such a sad state while many of us are receiving benefits we don’t want or need – and here I’m thinking specifically of heating allowances for fit baby boomers and free TV licences.However, even those of us who are advocates of a strong and universal system, in which all citizens have a stake if only by having a bus pass, find difficulty explaining the iniquities of the welfare cap to people living in low wage areas with lower housing costs, where £26,000 per year constitutes riches beyond belief.It is very sad that the task of reforming and revitalising support for the poorest should be taking place under a Tory government, at a time of austerity, rather than when the public finances were more buoyant in the Blair-Brown years.Les BrightExeter • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.comTopicsWelfareBenefitsPovertySocial exclusionSheffieldYorkshirelettersShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Being compared with Jason Leonard is not necessarily every young girl’s dream. For Rochelle Clark, though, there is no bigger honour than to draw up alongside the legendary prop as the most capped England rugby player, male or female, of all time. “It’s great to have my name associated with the ‘Fun Bus’,” acknowledges the 35-year-old Clark before her record-equalling 114th cap against France on Wednesday.A few minutes with “Rocky” is an education. This is a woman who turned up 24kg lighter for her third cap than for her second – just think about that for a second – and has played Test rugby for 14 years with no sign of calling it a day. Few female athletes in their mid-30s would even contemplate turning professional, as Clark is finally doing this season.In a perfect world she would continue playing loosehead prop for England until she is close to 40, win another World Cup and then go on to coach in the men’s game at a high level. Behind her glasses at the Hog’s Back hotel near Farnham on Monday, the competitive glint in her eye is unmissable: “They’ll have to take me away kicking and screaming probably. I’m still as hungry and passionate as I was 13 years ago. It’s still burning strong. I eat, sleep and breathe rugby.”England’s Ben Youngs seeks overdue victory against bruising South Africa Read moreThe brilliance of Clark, in short, is twofold. She is a role model for every teenage girl who has ever stood on a touchline and thought about giving the sport a go. In Clark’s case a team in Beaconsfield were short of players and she found herself, aged 15, participating in a totally alien game. “I didn’t even know women’s rugby existed. I absolutely loved it and never looked back.”Perhaps more significantly she is an inspiration to all in terms of self-discipline and commitment, having run on to the field for her first couple of caps in 2003 weighing 109kg, as opposed to her current 85kg. “I’d just sort of bumbled around before. I’d be eating a Caesar salad and thinking: ‘It’s salad, it’s healthy,’ but forgetting about the fried croutons, the sauce and the bacon.”Sausages and mash were her favourite. “I used to love having four sausages and a massive mound of mash. I just liked volume then.”Ah, the good old days. It makes the remodelled Clark the perfect individual to reflect on the cultural revolution sweeping through women’s rugby. For the first time 29 professional contracts have been awarded to England’s 15-a-side women’s players, following the example of sevens. It is a game-changer that should have a significant trickle-down effect on the women’s club game, both in terms of standards and interest.Anyone who saw the Australia women’s sevens team’s exhilarating slaughter of New Zealand in the Olympic final in Rio will already be aware of the spectacular ability of the world’s top female flyers. But therein lies the conundrum: sevens is a perfect promotional vehicle for women’s rugby, possibly to the long-term detriment of the 15-a-side game.The Rugby Football Union opted to try to fudge the issue temporarily by sending its most experienced 15-a-side backs away to the sevens circuit. Sadly, when it came to it in Rio, the GB squad located few rainbows never mind pots of gold medals. Too many looked what they were: players not entirely suited to the shorter format. In their absence the England 15-a-side team regressed without their senior figures, prompting widespread muttering all round.Hence this autumn’s much-trumpeted new era, with the national side rebranded as the Red Roses and Emily Scarratt, Katy McLean and Danielle Waterman back in the fold before the World Cup in Dublin and Belfast next August. Clark, for whom sevens was never a realistic option, could hardly be more thrilled. “I’m really happy I was part of the amateur era but so thankful I’m part of the professional bit now. Having to have a professional attitude has probably elongated my career. You can’t hide or just flop on to rucks. If you look at old team photos there were a few round edges back in 2003. Compared with 2016 you struggle to recognise which one is me.”In 10 to 15 years the chances are people will look back and be similarly taken aback. Clark, for one, reckons the women’s game is heading for a whole new level. “The game has already grown massively since I first started. You get so many players coming along now who have seen women’s rugby and are really inspired. For me the World Cup is bigger than the Olympics but that might be different for younger players coming through. The game is going to split and you will have sevens specialists, as the men do. I assume club rugby will eventually go professional as well. We’re probably 15 years behind the guys but I think we’re going to rise quite steeply.”Extending her own playing career as a fully fledged professional will temporarily put a brake on Clark’s coaching ambitions with the mens’ team at Chesham Stags and Bucks New University in High Wycombe; she has also been driving from Buckinghamshire to Worcester two or three times a week to train and play club rugby. She has a degree in sports science, an MBE for services to rugby and is hoping to pass her level four coaching qualification; if and when she overhauls Leonard and the Scottish women’s world record-holder Donna Kennedy, who won 115 caps, it will be due reward for her remarkable perseverance. As Leonard rightly puts it: “She’s an inspiration to everyone in rugby, not just women and girls coming through.”A penny for her thoughts, then, if she comes on as a replacement against France. “I’ll be reminded of running out for my 100th cap at Twickenham. That was so special. They put the lights on me, I ran out first and everyone in the crowd had these ‘Rocky’ masks which was pretty cool. But I’ll also be thinking of team-mates who have helped me get to where I have … unsung heroes like Amy Garnett, Sophie Hemming, Ness Gray and our former coach Graham Smith. I just want to do the jersey proud.”And when Leonard buys her a drink afterwards, what’s her order? “It won’t be that exciting. Probably just a pint of lager. I’m a pretty simple girl.”Born in the USAThe knock-on effects of Ireland’s outstanding win over New Zealand in Chicago will be fascinating. If Ireland were to complete a double over the All Blacks in Dublin on Saturday week, for example, selection for next year’s British and Irish Lions tour will assume a very different hue. CJ Stander, Devin Toner, Robbie Henshaw, Tadhg Furlong, Jack McGrath, Joey Carbery … on this evidence there could be plenty more Irish Lions to accompany certainties like Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton. Wales, in contrast, will need to bounce back swiftly against Argentina to disprove the theory they are a team who have suddenly hit a brick wall. Scotland and England, similarly, now have no excuse for kicking off their autumn campaigns sluggishly. Ireland have done the whole of world rugby a good turn.And another thing …The ejection of Andy Robinson from his director of rugby role at Bristol follows hard on the heels of Alex King’s departure as Northampton’s backs coach. There is increasingly little patience – or mercy – shown when Premiership sides fail to deliver, as Mike Ford also discovered at Bath last season. There is another recurring trend – if in doubt, go and recruit from the southern hemisphere. When was the last time a Premiership club appointed a young, innovative English coach to head up its operations rather than look abroad? With Dean Ryan no longer at Worcester, the only English-qualified head honchos left in the Premiership are John Kingston, Steve Diamond, Dean Richards, Rob Baxter, Richard Cockerill and Jim Mallinder. None of them are under the age of 45. The top three sides in the league are guided by an Ulsterman, a Welshman and a Kiwi. If Bristol simply look to South Africa for their next coach that is absolutely their prerogative but it will be a further blow to the increasingly battered esteem of English-reared coaching.TopicsEngland women's rugby union teamSportblogWomen's rugby unionRugby unioninterviewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Hillary Clinton’s gaze was fixed upon her cellphone as she emerged from her motorcade at the Westchester County airport. “Do you see the big plane?” she asked, turning the camera towards the 737 she was about to board for the final day of her campaign.She was speaking with her granddaughter, Charlotte, through FaceTime. “I love you,” the Democratic candidate said as she signed off.It was a peaceful start to an otherwise frenetic day. Clinton was set to blitz four cities in three battleground states to deliver her closing argument to voters, with a final rally at midnight in Raleigh, North Carolina.The following day, Tuesday 8 November, will determine whether Clinton breaks “that highest, hardest glass ceiling”, becoming the first female president in America’s 240-year history.Who is leading the polls the day before voting? Not a clear 'Clinton' or 'Trump' Read moreClinton arrived at the airport 40 miles north of New York City just as 55 members of the press had gathered at the wing of the plane for a group photo – a bipartisan tradition among candidates at the close of a long, grueling campaign. Some had trailed the former secretary of state nearly every day for two years.“The key is to do as you’re told,” Clinton quipped, as the pack of journalists struggled to follow the instructions of a campaign photographer.The Democratic nominee appeared relaxed on a day of many “lasts”: her last visits to a trio of states – Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina – as a presidential candidate; her last voyage in the campaign plane that since 5 September has crisscrossed the country; and her last opportunity to deliver a closing argument to the American people.Sensing their chance to quiz the candidate, also perhaps one last time, the press corps swiftly surrounded her the moment the photos were snapped. Did Clinton feel the American public was finally ready to accept her, one reporter asked.“I think I have some work to do to bring the country together,” Clinton responded, referring to the aftermath of a bitterly fought campaign, but leaving unaddressed the role her gender has played in the American public’s perception of her over the last 25 years.“I really do want to be the president for everybody,” she added, “people who vote for me, people who vote against me.“These splits, these divides that have been not only exposed but exacerbated by the campaign on the other side, are ones that we really do have to [resolve to] bring this country together.”Clinton’s comments echoed the message she has taken to the stump in the final stretch as voters go to the polls. Surveying the crowds of thousands who have packed into gymnasiums, outdoor parks and concert halls, often queuing up hours in advance, Clinton has sought to ease the concerns of a disenchanted electorate.“We will have some work to do to bring about healing and reconciliation after this election,” she told voters in Manchester, New Hampshire, on Sunday evening.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  ‘Vote for someone who cares’: Beyoncé and Jay Z back Clinton as woman for jobThe forward-looking sentiment is in some ways a testament to a confidence on Clinton’s part that, despite the narrowing of the polls, victory is in sight. But cautious optimism is a better reflection of the mood projected by both the candidate and her campaign.Turnout still holds the key to Clinton’s path to victory. Early voting returns favor the former secretary of state, with Democrats outpacing Republicans in the swing states whose electoral votes Clinton must secure to reach the 270 that will propel her to the presidency.And so she has lately dispensed with her usual stump speech, choosing instead to lean heavily on the logistics of how the thousands of voters standing before her can translate their enthusiasm into action. There is a number they can text or a website they can visit, Clinton says, that will provide them with the information they need to register to vote or find the nearest polling location.“We’re just going to work until the last vote is counted,” Clinton told reporters prior to departure on Monday.Her campaign has been bolstered by its ground game – the product of her team’s early and consistent investment in a vast infrastructure that in Florida alone spans 81 field offices. This weekend, volunteers in the battleground states made nearly 14.5m voter-to-voter contacts, the campaign said, comprising 6.2m door-knocks and 8.1m phone calls.A memo distributed by Clinton’s campaign on Monday emphasized a strong turnout among Latinos and African Americans, both core constituencies of the Democratic party. In Florida, more than one million Hispanics voted early, roughly double the number who did so in 2012, the report said. And in North Carolina, where Democrats were apprehensive about enthusiasm among black voters, a spike in recent days meant nearly the same number of African Americans had cast their ballots early as did so four years ago.What remains unknown, however, is the impact of FBI director James Comey’s decision to reopen the issue of her private email server a week and a half ago – and then just as suddenly attempt to resolve the matter on Sunday with a statement once again clearing her of criminal wrongdoing.Spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said the campaign was “glad that the matter is resolved”, but Clinton herself has not mentioned the latest developments. Her campaign manager lamented over the weekend that the renewed controversy had distracted from Clinton’s message, but downplayed its impact on the polls.A palpable anxiety was nonetheless evident on the faces of many who had braved the crisp fall weather to get a glimpse of Clinton as she concluded her journey. Clutching campaign signs bearing one of Clinton’s slogans, “Love trumps hate”, they jeered at the mention of her opponent’s name. The Democratic candidate has rewarded them with a bevy of celebrity performers, from Beyoncé and Jay Z to Katy Perry and James Taylor; Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi will perform at her rally in Philadelphia on Monday night.In Manchester on Sunday, Clinton took the stage with a figure who has become well-known for a very different reason. Khizr Khan became an overnight celebrity when he delivered a stirring speech at the Democratic national convention in July, holding up a copy of his pocket constitution and memorably telling Donald Trump: “You have sacrificed nothing and no one.” Trump went on to attack him and his wife in racially inflected terms. I'm supposed to vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a woman. Well, I won't | LaSha Read moreIntroducing Clinton on Sunday, Khan shared an anecdote befitting the night’s theme of healing. Khan was recently approached by a woman, he said, whose 10-year-old son was bullied in school and told he would be “thrown out of here”. She showed him Khan’s convention speech, which the boy proceeded to watch every day after facing yet more taunts from his classmates. With permission from the school’s principal, the teacher decided to play Khan’s speech for the entire class. “A few days later, the mother asked him, ‘Have you been bullied?’ And he said, ‘No. Not after that speech,’” Khan recounted.Taking the podium, Clinton thanked Khan for telling the story. “That really struck a chord with me,” she said. “These are words that I would hope that all Americans, and particularly young Americans, would hear and heed.”TopicsHillary ClintonUS politicsUS elections 2016newsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
The first Police and Crime Plan for London had a crowd-pleasing quality, as might have been expected from the mayoralty of Boris Johnson. The document, which the capital’s mayors must produce through their office for policing and crime (MOPAC), set a list of six targets for the period 2013-2016, all of which which featured the figure 20%. It promised a reduction in what it defined as “key neighbourhood crimes” - snappily dubbed the MOPAC 7 - by 20%, reduced re-offending by young people leaving custody by 20%, lessened “delays in the criminal justice system” by 20% and a 20% increase in compliance with community sentences. The same percentage goal was set for “an increase in confidence” in the Met. And all this was to be done while reducing costs by 20% as the capital’s police service took its austerity hit. What was achieved? Depends on how you look at it. The most recent Police and Crime Plan annual report, covering the year to July 2015, says that the Met had already hit its youth reoffending target, was “on track” with the MOPAC 7 and cutting costs, getting mixed results on court delays, and improving but not fast enough on community sentence compliance and confidence levels. Quite apart from what you make of those results, such target-setting raises questions of itself, such as about the means by which progress is measured and the choice of targets in the first place. Johnson also claimed an 18% fall in all crime since taking office in 2008 and trumpeted getting the number of warranted Met officers up to 32,000, but the significance of these figures too have been challenged. For example, London Assembly Conservatives have highlighted the non-investigation of many “acquisitve crimes” while the Greens have argued that officers recruited for that nebulous concept “the frontline” have ended up doing so-called “back office” work because the numbers of civilian staff trained to do it had been cut. When Johnson’s plan was being drafted, a trio of high powered criminologists were highly sceptical about the confidence target - both the percentage and, most importantly, the way in which public confidence was to be defined and quantified. The assumption seemed to be that having more “bobbies on the beat” would push the confidence numbers up and that would be that, when what really mattered was the confidence that comes from good quality interactions with the service and its officers - a confidence that they will be there to help you when you need them and make effective, efficient use use of any help that you provide them with. One of the criminologists said, with some force, that the very setting and pursuit of targets, especially if they appear unrealistic or arbitrary, can have perverse effects: cynicism among officers; the management of crime figures so that the targets can appear to have been met. We might hope that Sadiq Khan, a former civil rights lawyer with wide experience of spotting where policing and police culture can go wrong, will be alive to all these issues and that his policing deputy Sophie Linden will be too. They aim to publish a new Police and Crime Plan towards the end of the financial year (before April, in other words), and to have a draft of it ready for public consultation before Christmas. Londoners’ views are now being solicited by way of an online survey, which asks for our views about, among other things, neighbourhood policing, cyber crime against businesses, keeping young people safe and tackling violence against women and girls, hate crime and extremism. Some clues, there, perhaps, to the new mayoralty’s priorities for the Met and whoever becomes its next commissioner. You can take the survey here.

In September, Hillary Clinton came under fire for suggesting that half of Donald Trump’s supporters belonged in “a basket of deplorables” consisting of “the racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic – you name it.” Labeling people in such a disparaging manner is not a constructive approach. However, research has shown it’s true that Donald Trump brings out the worst characteristics in Americans. Only about half of Trump supporters think global warming is real, and twice as many Republicans are unsure about the evidence as they were a year ago. Hostility towards women and racial resentment correlate with Trump support almost as strongly as party affiliation. Xenophobia, misogyny, and denial of science and facts are the defining characteristics of Donald Trump’s candidacy.How did we get here? Journalists have struggled to treat Donald Trump as something other than a standard presidential candidate. Because he constantly spawns new scandals and is lacking in the policy department, to normalize Trump and abnormalize Clinton, network evening news programs have devoted three times more coverage to Hillary Clinton’s emails than all policies combined, as accurately satirized by Saturday Night Live:   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Saturday Night Live opening sketch, 05 November 2016.The nightly news programs have devoted zero time to discussing the candidates’ climate plans. Media false balance has struck again.It’s important to realize that Donald Trump does have a few policy positions. For example, he wants to burn coal indefinitely because he denies the climate change consequences. Trump also wants to eliminate government spending on clean energy and climate research, cut taxes predominantly for the most wealthy, build a costly and pointless border wall, engage in expensive mass deportations, and deregulate the financial industry. Hillary Clinton’s extensive policy plans are effectively the opposite of Trump’s.Many are puzzled that a candidate with such generally unpopular policy plans and who has been endorsed by the KKK could be supported by over 40% of Americans and have a chance at winning the presidency of the United States. Unfortunately we seem to have entered a post-truth era in which facts simply don’t matter. The two American political parties have become so different that swing voters have virtually gone extinct and most conservatives would vote for Mister Ed, were he the Republican Party nominee. Political ideology trumps facts, truth, and reality. And Trump’s support comes heavily from a single demographic: white men, mostly older and without a college degree.Trump wants to regress to the white male-dominated 1950sThe Trump campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” suggests that he wants to return the country to some bygone era. Based on the candidate’s words and his supporters’ feelings about science, women, and minorities, that era resembles the 1950s.In the 1950s, only about one-third of women participated in the American work force, and African-Americans were still fighting for equality in the Civil Rights Movement. The tobacco industry created the playbook followed by the fossil fuel industry today: spread misinformation and sow doubt to keep the public consuming its deadly products. Nearly half of Americans smoked cigarettes in the 1950s (as compared to under 17% today). The tobacco industry already knew that smoking caused cancer, but used the denial playbook to keep Americans puffing.These characteristics fit the era that Trump and his supporters appear to yearn for – an era in which white men dominated American society. Older, white male Americans who comprise the core of Donald Trump’s base are also the predominant climate science-denying group in the country. Social scientists theorize this is due to the group’s historical societal advantages. They have benefited from the societal status quo, and hence are least concerned with risks, especially when addressing those risks would mean changing the status quo from which they benefited.Like it or not, the status quo is changingWhite, male Americans are in the process of losing those historical societal advantages. As minority populations grow, they’re losing their grip on the American majority. The first racial minority president was elected and re-elected. Women are approaching even footing with men in the labor force. Even social norms are changing, for example with gay marriage becoming legal.And of course the Earth’s climate itself is changing rapidly due to human-caused global warming, which is causing all sorts of negative consequences. Climate scientists are pleading with American voters not to make a choice our children will regret: You have a fateful choice to make. The policies of candidates and parties on climate change could hardly be more different. Hillary Clinton would continue to work with the international community to tackle the global warming crisis and help the transition to modern clean and renewable energies. Donald Trump denies that the problem even exists and has promised to go back to coal and to undo the Paris AgreementDonald Trump would be the only world leader to deny human-caused global warming and the tremendous risks it poses. His threats to undo the progress made to tackle climate change have elicited widespread condemnation from the international community, most recently from the Chinese government. When asked how his country would work with a Trump administration on climate change, China’s climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua said: If they resist this trend, I don’t think they’ll win the support of their people, and their country’s economic and social progress will also be affected. I believe a wise political leader should take policy stances that conform with global trendsAmericans: don’t vote to reverse half a century of progressDonald Trump’s goal is to make America Mad Men again by reversing the progress we’ve made over the past half century and returning the country to a 1950s era-style society dominated by white men.While progress toward racial and gender equality could hypothetically be reversed in a Trump presidency, climate change can’t be. Only by continuing the progress we’ve made toward cutting carbon pollution can we slow global warming. Problems are not solved by denying their existence.America has many great characteristics; many argue the country is already great. But like every country, there are also dark periods in its past; for example, in the treatment of minorities and women as second-class citizens. Donald Trump aims to return America to those deplorable periods, and to put the world on a path toward a catastrophic future by undoing the progress we’ve made in tackling climate change.The world is counting on Americans not to make a catastrophically wrong choice in tomorrow’s election.TopicsClimate change scepticismClimate Consensus - the 97%Climate changeDonald TrumpHillary ClintonblogpostsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
The Chinese government’s decision to bar two elected lawmakers from taking up their seats marks the beginning of the end of Hong Kong.Samuel Johnson once said, “Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel”. And today China has said that in Hong Kong, patriotism is so vital that it trumps freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of thought, which are all now completely irrelevant.By preventing the two pro-independence politicians from taking office, the Chinese government has opened the door to disqualify anyone from Hong Kong’s government if they are determined to not be loyal to Beijing.This sets a very, very dangerous precedent because China has now started to form a habit of ruling Hong Kong by decree. Rule of law has become nonexistent in Hong Kong and there is no telling how that’s going to affect the confidence of foreign investors. We have to plug the dyke, but there’s nothing Hong Kong people can do and that explains all the fear, anger, resentment and frustration you now see in the city.'Festering pustules': the two pro-democracy activists who are targets of China's wrath Read moreOf course, according to the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the power of interpretation is vested in Beijing, but that sort of power should not be used lightly. Every policeman has the power to stop you in the street and haul you off to the station if you’re acting suspiciously, but no one expects every policemen to do that lightly. Beijing is abusing its power.Beijing loyalists in Hong Kong’s legislature will say, ‘We need to protect the integrity of the motherland, you’re not allowed to say things like ‘Hong Kong is not China.’’ They worry these sentiments will spread to places like Tibet and Xinjiang, western Chinese provinces with large populations of ethnic minorities and a history of chafing under Beijing’s yoke. The Chinese government never promised “one country, two systems” to Tibet or Xinjiang, but that promise was made to Hong Kong. However, that and the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which sought to safeguard freedoms in the former colony, is now completely shattered and has become irrelevant. China’s mandarins now behave exactly like the Big Brother in George Orwell’s 1984. Whatever and whenever they find something politically incorrect, they will just change it and make it bend to their will. The oath-taking saga is merely an excuse to make sure Hong Kong will be reined in. Chinese officials needed an issue and pounced at the first opportunity, because in Beijing’s eyes Hong Kong has become uncontrollable and disobedient, especially after the umbrella movement.This is a very frightening trend that shows Beijing will interpret Hong Kong laws any time it wants. Anytime they feel parts of the Basic Law are not up to their current standards of political correctness, they will change it and tell Hong Kong courts to obey.This move is not only a blow to our legislature, but also local courts as well. What are our judges for if Beijing steps in whenever it wants?Today Beijing talks about anti-independence, tomorrow it talks about anti-self-determination and the day after it can talk about anti-democracy altogether.While I have met some young people who have foreign passports who want to stay and fight for Hong Kong, they have a safety net and can leave whenever they want. I’m very worried about the young who can’t afford to leave and have no choice but to fight on against extremely difficult odds. But we still need to fight, because if we don’t, we will definitely never get what we want.Claudia Mo is a member of Hong Kong’s legislative council and founding member of the Civic Party.TopicsHong KongChinaAsia PacificcommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Last week, I received a text from a friend stating that I had “been found out”. It was linked to an article in this paper by writer and comedian Andy Hamilton about fantasists and a fake Andy Hamilton. Later that day, I received an email about the same article from the Guardian, informing me that I had received a payment for said article. I had indeed been paid for an article written by someone with the same name as me. It would appear that confusion had rained down at there being two Andy Hamiltons.It’s an easy mistake to make. In the BBC archives sits an episode of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, unaired due to a similar mistake: the then host, Roy Plomley found himself interviewing the European director for tourism for Ontario, Canada, Alistair MacLean. This Alistair MacLean was not the author of Where Eagles Dare, the intended castaway, but a figure unknown to British audiences.As one half of identical twins, I’m used to being confused for the wrong person. It’s something that has got me out of childhood fights and even had me saved from getting sacked (sacked as me, reinstated as my brother).Over the last 10 years, I have found myself in the strange position of being able to monetise having the same name as an unrelated Andy Hamilton. People turn up to my talks hoping to hear Andy Hamilton, writer, Radio 4 regular and occasional panel-show guest. Instead, they get Andy Hamilton, midlist author talking about foraging, gin, wild cocktails or beer.I was first aware of this phenomenon due to an admission from someone who came to see the wrong Andy Hamilton. It was after my first talk to a packed auditorium, standing-room only. I felt elated until this comment left me feeling that I owed my success due to the sharing of a name. It happened again when I was promoting my third book, Brewing Britain. A man informed me that he was there to see Radio 4’s Andy Hamilton. But as my book was about beer, and he liked beer, he stayed. After the talk he bought my book and me a pint.It was then that I realised I should approach this name-sharing with some humility. I started calling myself and my blog The Other Andy Hamilton. At the start of every talk that I have given since, I offer people the chance to leave if they are there to see another Andy Hamilton, be he the comedian, the darts player, or George Michael’s keyboardist or the builder from Somerset.It doesn’t just happen to me though: Radio 4 Andy Hamilton once got halfway through an interview before they both realised he wasn’t the jazz saxophonist, Andy Hamilton.• This article was corrected on 7 November 2016. The late jazz musician, Andy Hamilton was a saxophonist, rather than a trumpeter, as we had it.

Could the ruling lead to no Brexit?In itself no, because this is a ruling about how Brexit is achieved – the process – not the desirability or otherwise of it. The decision to leave has been taken and would require another referendum to reverse. What the judges decided was how the process of leaving had to be carried out. They determined that parliament should be the body that decides on matters to do with UK law, in this case the triggering of article 50, which sets the UK on a two-year path to exit and will mean EU laws no longer apply here. The government had argued this could be done by royal prerogative, effectively side-stepping parliament. The judges disagreed.There is no doubt, however, that the judgment gives the Remain side, which has a majority in the Commons and Lords, new opportunities to try to ensure Brexit is not too hard, that we remain tied into as many of the EU’s projects – the single market, police cooperation, and research – as possible, while leaving full membership of the club. Longer term, some Remainers believe there is a chance that the public will turn against Brexit if and when people see that the rosy future they were promised outside the EU is not quite so easy to achieve after all. If the judgment means the dangers of leaving come more into the public mind, it is possible it could mark a turning point.What does the ruling mean the government now has to do?Theresa May made clear last week that she will appeal against the decision in the supreme court. The case will be heard next month, and a ruling made quite swiftly. If, as most people assume, that appeal fails, ministers will have to prepare legislation so that parliament can play the role the judges said it must, in setting in motion article 50.The nightmare for the prime minister, however, is that she will no longer be able to hide behind her stock, stalling phrases, “Brexit means Brexit” and “we won’t give a running commentary” – that have covered the fact that ministers are unclear how to proceed as they never expected the public to vote to leave.If May does not reveal quickly what kind of Brexit she wants (single market membership or not?), MPs will use the parliamentary process which the courts have insisted on to force decisions and clarity on her. They can seek to amend the bill which will have to be presented to them, to shape Brexit as they want to see it. A majority of MPs across all parties could then force her hand. If the Commons does not amend the bill, the House of Lords certainly will seek to do so.Ministers have to try to find a position on Brexit that will win the backing of MPs and peers. How they do it, no one knows.Will it be a free vote?This will be the subject of great debate in both the Tory and Labour parties. Cabinet ministers were allowed to campaign as they wished before the referendum vote so it is difficult to see how Conservative MPs can be forced to vote against their wishes at this stage, particularly if amendments are submitted on issues such as single market membership. The Tory manifesto committed the party to safeguard the UK’s position in the single market, whether we left or stayed in the EU. So to force MPs to vote to leave it would not be popular with many. The danger of imposing a whip on MPs is that many will rebel. Informal cross-party alliances will be more important than the strictures of the whips.Does the ruling mean an early election?It makes it more likely because the ruling has undermined the government (it lost in the courts) and highlighted May’s lack of a personal mandate and weakness in parliament. Her tiny Commons majority, shrunk further by the resignation of the Tory MP Stephen Phillips, leaves her in a perilous position in any contentious vote.As she has insisted she does not intend to go to the country before 2020, doing so would be seen as a sign of her being buffeted around by events. An election – while likely to deliver a larger Tory majority – would be no easy fix, however. It would highlight profound splits in the Conservative party in parliament and between its MPs and supporters in the country.Brexit would be put on hold for three months of national debate and squabbling and the economy could be harmed by more uncertainty. Labour would have to back an early election which most of its MPs would dread. It would be an election that nobody wanted. Rather than healing the divide over Brexit it could well deepen it.Could the row do lasting constitutional damage and further erode faith in the institutions that run the country? The irony behind the arguments over the judges’ ruling is that Leave campaigners insist that – above all else – they want to “take back control” from European institutions and vest it again in British ones. But now that the UK’s own courts have made a ruling that complicates the passage towards a hard Brexit and argues for the very thing that Leave campaigners wanted most (parliament to be given back control) they complain that the judges’ assessment is a betrayal of the people. The danger now is that it will not just be faith in politicians that is harmed, but faith in the UK legal system as well.The country’s unwritten constitution operates a delicate set of checks and balances, determined through precedent, involving the Crown, parliament, the executive and the judiciary. The call by the Bar Council for justice secretary Liz Truss to condemn attacks on the judges was the opening salvo in what could become a toxic and hugely destabilising inter-institutional war between key components of the system. The Brexit debate has asked fundamental questions about where power lies in the UK. It was simpler when parliamentary democracy operated on well trodden paths. But on 23 June the people spoke and the system is uncertain as to how to deliver their will.Sensing that it could stir the Brexit-backing part of the population into a mass revolt against the judges, the Daily Mail labelled them “enemies of the people” on Friday and pointed out that one, Sir Terence Etherton, was “openly gay”.What began as a question about the EU’s power has become a potentially very dangerous one about the power of the people and how far it can trump that of parliament and the courts.TopicsBrexitThe ObserverGina Millerq&asShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
For Hugo Lloris, the low point of Tottenham Hotspur’s season was defined by something unacceptable. The team’s style suffered a jarring breakdown in the 1-0 Champions League defeat against Bayer Leverkusen at Wembley on Wednesday night but it was the reason why that so infuriated the captain. According to him, the players had lost their focus. The mentality was flawed.“You cannot pretend to be a challenger, you cannot pretend to be a big club in Europe, if you are not ready to compete,” Lloris says, his measured tones somehow amplifying the force of the sentiment. “My feeling was that the team was not ready to compete against Leverkusen because, under pressure, we lost a bit of our strength, we didn’t create a lot and we made a lot of mistakes. We have a proper style to play football and I didn’t recognise the team.”The stirring 2-0 Premier League home win over Manchester City on 2 October, which was built on smartly applied pressure and cohesion, felt like a long way away and it is no great stretch to portray Tottenham as being in turmoil as they head into the north London derby at Arsenal on Sunday.On one level, it sounds ridiculous, as Mauricio Pochettino’s team boast the only unbeaten record in the division. They have the meanest defence, too, by a margin. But, on the other hand, the post-City sequence now stands at six matches without a win in all competitions and, post-Leverkusen, their hopes of qualification to the knockout phase of the Champions League hang by a thread.They have scored only three goals in those six games (two of them penalties) and it is this misfiring that shadows them into the derby; chipping away at the collective belief. Pochettino said last Tuesday that the issue was not related to technique or ability; rather, it was psychological. The manager has been grilled on the subject – so have the players – and when this type of narrative takes hold, the circle can become vicious.Arsenal v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview Read moreSon Heung-min was asked whether the confidence in front of goal had been low. “Maybe, maybe it is,” the forward says. “We have had great chances in every game and it’s also a bit unlucky. But we have to accept that it is three goals in six games. We’ll try to change the face against Arsenal.”Lloris adds: “It’s a collective problem and we are all involved in that. It’s not only the offensive players, it’s the whole team, and we need to find a solution. If not, it’s going to be tough.”Almost all of Spurs’ matches this season have been knife-edge affairs and Pochettino has called for greater ruthlessness almost as a matter of course. The contrast to Arsenal, who are in form and free-scoring, is vivid and it is a source of worry for Tottenham.Much has been made of Harry Kane’s absence since the middle of September with an ankle ligament injury, even if nobody was talking about it after the City game, when Son had played like a world-beater at centre-forward. Kane brings more than dead-eyed precision in the penalty area; his movement drags opposing defences out of shape, opening up spaces for his team-mates and his link-up play is excellent.As Tottenham have stuttered, the options that Kane provides have come to be missed more and more. He will return against Arsenal – in the starting XI – and that will provide an emotional uplift; particularly, as he has scored in the previous three league derbies. His two-goal heroics in the 2-1 victory over Arsenal in February 2015 have entered Tottenham folklore. Then again, one man can only do so much.“Maybe Harry is going to give us a little boost, which is the thing that we need at the moment,” Lloris says. “We have some important players in our team, like in every club, and when they miss some games, sometimes it can affect the performance. But we cannot hide ourselves behind those excuses.”Tottenham’s Harry Kane ready for comeback against Arsenal Read moreTottenham got themselves into a tizz against Leverkusen, with one error leading to another and it was shocking to see how they failed to make in-roads in an attacking sense. They created little of clear-cut note in open play. Pochettino has trumpeted his 4-1-4-1 formation as his plan B – perhaps, because he is mindful that his critics say he does not have one – but when he switched to it against Leverkusen, from 4-2-3-1, it did not make the difference.In the City game, Tottenham had a clear plan against a team that like to get on the front foot and play. The hope is that Spurs can profit similarly against Arsenal, who are also proactive rather than reactive – especially at home. Where Tottenham have struggled is against opponents who organise themselves tightly behind the ball and want to sting on the counterattack; when the onus has been on Pochettino’s players to find the decisive combinations.Pochettino talks about how the problem might not lie entirely in the attacking third. “Maybe, it’s because we are not building in a very good way from the back and the ball arrives in the last third in different condition,” he says, with possible reference to how the distribution skills of the injured centre-half, Toby Alderweireld, have been missed. “It’s a very complex job for us to analyse why. But it’s true that we are finding a problem and now it’s more difficult to try to fix that.”The Champions League has brought additional demands and it was interesting to hear Son say: “Physically, it’s difficult – every three days, we have a game.” But a big part of the analysis has been to address how so many of the team’s key attack-minded players have hit a slump.Mousa Dembélé has been unable to find the rhythms of last season because of suspension and injuries; Christian Eriksen went missing against Leverkusen and his influence has waned; Son is suddenly struggling and Dele Alli has admitted that he has to “start being more clinical”. Then, there is the case of Vincent Janssen. The striker’s lack of a burst of pace has been an issue and his movement compares unfavourably to that of Kane. The way the £17m summer signing from Alkmaar regularly chooses the safe option reflects a lack of confidence.Pochettino has enjoyed decent enough results against Arsenal – one win and three draws in the league, though he lost to them in last season’s Capital One Cup – and he might reflect that the run his team is on, complete with the heavy scrutiny, is merely a part of the Premier League cycle.Soul-searching, however, has been the theme of the past few days. “I hope we are going to bounce back and, at least, make a great performance,” Lloris says. “After, you win; you lose. But you cannot leave the pitch with that feeling that we had after Leverkusen.”TopicsTottenham HotspurSportblogArsenalfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
The US is the closest it’s ever been to breaking the 240-year male stronghold on the presidency. Though American women have made some political gains during that period, there has only been one woman so far with a real chance of smashing that glass ceiling: Hillary Clinton.And yet some women, especially young women, have greeted Clinton’s historic candidacy with muted enthusiasm.“I want there to be a woman president, of course,” said Maria Alcivar, a graduate student at Iowa State University and reluctant Clinton supporter. “I just don’t see why it had to be her.”Across the country over the last 18 months, several women have expressed similar sentiments: a wish that the potential first female leader was someone less flawed and less polarizing. Because women have higher and harder barriers to clear, the women that win need to exceed expectationsAdrienne Kimmell, Barbara Lee Family FoundationExperts say there is no predictable route to the presidency for a female candidate, not least because the trail is still being blazed. But there is a case to be made that the first woman to get this close to the presidency would probably look a lot like Clinton: a nationally recognizable figure with an extensive résumé and close proximity to power.“There’s a saying, the first into battle needs to wear the most armor,” said Adrienne Kimmell, executive director of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which studies women running for executive office.She continued: “Because women have higher and harder barriers to clear the path to executive office, the women that win need to exceed expectations – so by comparison they tend to be more qualified than their opponents.”A 2011 study identified what the researchers called the “Jackie (and Jill) Robinson effect”, a reference to the first African American player in Major League Baseball. Robinson broke baseball’s color barrier in 1947 and by no coincidence, according to the theory, he remains one of the best players of all time.The study found that female lawmakers outperform their male colleagues, introducing more legislation and delivering more financial projects to their home districts. This, the researchers suggest, is the result of underlying gender discrimination, which narrows the prospective pool of female candidates down to only the most qualified, talented and politically ambitious. Women who ran before Hillary Clinton: 'I cannot vote, but I can be voted for' Read more“One of the reasons it’s taking so long to elect a woman president is because very few women have actually run for president,” said Jennifer Lawless, the director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University. The first may have been Victoria Woodhull in 1872, nearly 50 years before women won the vote, and 136 years before Clinton’s first competitive campaign in 2008.The gender gap leaves a very narrow pipeline to the top, Lawless said. The most common route to the US presidency is through the Senate or a governor’s mansion, which greatly narrows the pool of prospective female candidates, since there are currently only 20 women serving in the 100-strong US Senate, 84 congresswomen (19%) and six female governors.Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado who briefly ran for the Democratic nomination in 1987, has spent a lot of time over the last 18 months thinking about what has changed for women since she first entered Congress in 1973.“Sexism is a lot harder to pinpoint than it was but it’s clearly still there,” she said.When Schroeder first arrived in Congress she faced questions from her male colleagues about how she managed to raise two small children while being a lawmaker. On one occasion she snapped back: “I have a brain and a uterus and I use both.” She was also advised never to wear green. It apparently was not a power color.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Hillary Clinton at a rally in Detroit, Michigan. Photograph: Brian Snyder/ReutersResearch shows that women who run for elective office win at comparable rates to men. Party trumps gender at the ballot box. That is to say, male and female voters overwhelmingly support their party’s candidate, regardless of gender.In an analysis of 2010 House races, female candidates received as many votes as male candidates of the same seat status (incumbent, open seat, challenger), according to a study by Kathleen Dolan published in her 2014 book, When Does Gender Matter? Women Candidates and Gender Stereotypes in American Elections. And yet women seeking to run for office still encounter barriers their male counterparts do not. Studies show they are less likely to express interest in a political career and more likely to doubt their ability to run. Women are less likely to put themselves forward and need to be recruited to run for office, research suggests.The Guardian view on the US election: Hillary Clinton is the world’s best hope | Editorial Read moreIvy Taylor, the mayor of San Antonio, said she did not start her career expecting to run for public office. After encouragement from her husband and community leaders she decided to try for a seat on the city council in 2009.“I felt qualified but not ready, if that makes sense,” Taylor said of her decision to run. “It took some time for me to get used to the idea because I didn’t think of myself as a politician but then I came to understand that elected office was an extension of my commitment to working with people in order to create a better future.”Taylor is one of only 19 big city mayors, according to a 2016 report by the CUNY Institute for State and Local Governance of the 100 largest US cities. Of the top 15, only San Antonio has a female mayor.Experts and political groups involved in recruiting women to elective office say that having a female president – whoever she is – will open doors for women at every level of government, regardless of party. In some cases, even the prospect of a Clinton presidency has already helped.“It is not a coincidence that we have a [high] number of Democratic women running in competitive Senate races in the same year we have Hillary Clinton at the top of the ticket,” according to Muthoni Wambu Kraal, the senior director for state and local campaigns at Emily’s List, which has been helping elect pro-choice women since 1985. “She was a powerful recruitment tool.”Correction, 7 November 2016: A quote from Muthoni Wambu Kraal of Emily’s List suggested a “record” number of Democratic women were running in competitive races this year.

It may be seven weeks until Christmas but with John Lewis due to launch its latest tear-jerker next week, the unofficial start of the annual festive battle for the hearts and minds – and, ultimately, wallets – of the British public is about to commence in earnest.Christmas ads – the best (and the worst) Read moreCompanies – led by the big name retailers and supermarkets – will spend a record £5.6bn this year in a frenzied attempt to outdo each other. But does the lavish brand-building and product-pushing translate into higher festive sales?John Lewis is expected to launch a £7m ad campaign on 10 November, with sources tipping Randy Crawford’s song One Day I’ll Fly Away as the soundtrack.The retailer makes 20% of annual sales and 40% of its profits over the Christmas quarter and capturing the nation’s hearts is absolutely critical.“Failing to engage the nation would have a significant commercial, social and cultural impact on the John Lewis brand,” says its ad agencies in a detailed analysis of its Christmas ads. “We make just over £8 [profit] for every pound we spend so the Christmas ad campaigns are hugely profitable,” says Craig Inglis, customer director and marketing chief at John Lewis. “The returns are long term as well; we see the continuing impact. The £7m we spend is dwarfed by our competitors. We punch well above our weight.”John Lewis says its Christmas ad campaigns over the past four years, which have included two star-crossed snowmen, a bear and a hare, Monty the penguin, and an elderly man on the moon, have fuelled an average 16% lift in festive sales. The number of festive shoppers in John Lewis stores has climbed more than 50% from 926,000 to 1.4m between 2013 and 2015.John Lewis’s ads may grab the most headlines but it is not the only major player to have used advertising to turn Christmas into a commercial cracker.From its big budget and controversial ad highlighting the spirit of the Christmas Day truce in the first world war trenches, to last year’s revival of Judith Kerr’s loveable calamitous cat Mog which spawned a best-selling childrens book, Sainsbury’s is the only retailer to have come close to John Lewis in recent years.This year’s Sainsbury’s ad, which will launch on 14 November, will showcase another “interesting creative collaboration”, following tie-ups with the British Legion and Kerr’s Mog.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Sainsbury’s Christmas Calamity advert, featuring Mog. Photograph: Sainsbury's/PAThe Mog campaign, which trumped John Lewis’s Monty the Penguin as the most-viewed ad on YouTube UK in 2015, helped the supermarket beat analyst expectations for sales over the Christmas period, although they still fell by 0.4%.Craig Mawdsley, joint chief strategy officer at Sainsbury’s ad agency AMV BBDO, says research has shown that the supermarket managed a profit of £24 for every £1 spent on its Christmas ad campaign in 2014. The figure was even stronger last year. “Classic [advertising] of just products, and big prices and headlines actually generates much lower return on investment than a beautiful 3.5 minute film with a cat in it,” Mawdsley says. “That’s largely because it has a broader brand effect. Product advertising alone is short term and doesn’t help the long-term perception of the brand.”Sainsbury’s spent almost £22m on advertising over Christmas last year, part of its battle to see off discount supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl.Aldi and Lidl spent £23m each on marketing last Christmas, with only Tesco and Asda higher among the supermarket brands in 2015. Lidl used its festive advertising to push the public to reappraise it as a quality brand. Currys/PC World hit the jackpot with a major shift away from its usual product promotion strategy and hiring American actor Jeff Goldblum. Pushing its brand not its products for the first time boosted festive sales by 5%, above analyst expectations.Other success stories include House Of Fraser, which has once again gone for the “anti-John Lewis” strategy – punchy soundtrack and in-your-face dancing. Last year’s attitude-laden “Your Christmas, Your Rules”, which used Justin Bieber’s choreographer, has been followed up with the newly launched “Christmas is Coming to Get You” featuring Ready or Not, famously covered by the Fugees, sung by Laura Mvula.House of Fraser hope its counter-strategy will work again this year –sales over Christmas 2015 rose 5.2% and the store notched up its biggest ever online shopping day.“It’s tough out there, the Brexit vote revealed a nation not in a good place,” says Jonathan Trimble, chief executive of House of Fraser’s ad agency 18 Feet & Rising. “We have taken advantage of people being a little angrier out there. John Lewis has done a Richard Curtis [director of Love Actually and Four Weddings and A Funeral] to Christmas ads. That’s not relevant to everyone.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Dominic West stars in the Christmas Burberry advert. Photograph: PRBut for every Christmas cracker there are a few turkeys. Last year’s big budget effort by M&S, once a Christmas high-flyer who spends well over £23m a year, was little more than a glitzy product ad using the beyond-saturated Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. Its Christmas sales fell 5.8%.So too Morrisons, which last year dumped its traditional celebrity tie-up with Ant ’n’ Dec, in favour of a back-to-basics approach featuring its own staff.A flurry of campaigns with totally divergent strategies have already hit the screens, from early runner Burberry’s mini-film featuring Sienna Miller and Domhnall Gleeson, and Harvey Nichol’s tongue-in-cheek “Britalia” campaign celebrating all things Italian, to Argos’s £30,000-a-pop ice skating Yetis.“People at Christmas want to be engaged in stories,” says Craig Inglis, who despite John Lewis’s recent success takes nothing for granted this year. “Not everyone can do a John Lewis ad. We have to keep the thread [of ads] and also keep it fresh. No one here is resting on their laurels. We don’t believe the hype.”                TopicsRetail industryChristmas adsJohn LewisJ SainsburyAdvertisingSupermarketsfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
When I read that Boris Johnson wrote two different newspaper columns to help him decide whether he should back the remain campaign or Brexit, I was astonished. A journalist doing double the amount of required work for no extra pay? But looking at Johnson’s Teflon – no, let’s not sugar coat this, his cockroach-like survival skills – I’ve decided I could learn something.As you might have heard, in three days’ time there will be this election thingummybob, somewhere. So this week I shall write two columns, one for each of the two possible outcomes (please, no one mention hanging chads) so that you, dear readers, can deploy the relevant one come Wednesday morning. Consider this my homage to the Johnsonian approach, without the risk of me then becoming foreign secretary. Because while America may be a divided country, nobody wants that.***Wow, welcome to the dawn of President Trump, folks. Who could have foreseen that 6 November bombshell in Hillary Clinton’s emails, that Anthony Weiner was in the pay of Vladimir Putin all along? This did at least explain his otherwise completely inexplicable behaviour, but the fact that Clinton’s closest aide was married to a Russian spy was too much for some, and so they handed the election to the guy who used to sell mail-order steaks.The result was announced just a few hours ago, and already Trump has ordered that the White House be gold plated and renamed Trump Mansion. In its current state, he said, the presidential residence is “a disaster, a total disaster, a place for losers”, but he will soon make it “tremendous, the best, the most expensive building anyone’s ever seen, even better than the Trump Plaza and Casino in New Jersey” (which closed two years ago and left thousands unemployed).Meanwhile, the stock market has plunged but Trump says this is just because the markets are “stupid” and, anyway, Americans will soon be using rubles, which is “the best, the richest currency” according to Trump’s “smartest guys. I have the smartest guys”. Because no US politician wants to work with him, he has put his children into office – his son Donnie as secretary of defence, Eric as secretary of state, 10-year-old Barron as chief of staff, and Ivanka as attorney general because, her father explained, “she’ll look tremendous in a general’s uniform”.If Paddington Bear pitched up today, would anyone give him a warm welcome? Read moreNo one has seen the Clintons since the vote was confirmed, though there is a rumour they were seen fleeing the country in Barbra Streisand’s private jet. In Hollywood, the studios say that all but one of their actors have vanished, so all movies will now star Hulk Hogan. Coca Cola says it has lost the recipe for all its drinks except New Coke.The American experiment is over. Prince William has offered amnesty to any US citizens who wish to return to their colonial overlords, but Nigel Farage has dismissed this, because he is now America’s colonial overlord. Chaos reigns.***It’s President Clinton! Again! It certainly was a close-run race, especially with that whole email issue. Who could have foreseen that they would reveal he was swapping dick pics with one DonaldTrump@donaldtrump.com? “I saw your dick pic, and you have the dick of a loser. Mine is tremendous, incredible, doctors tell me I have the greatest dick of all time,” Trump wrote in the first email, with photographic evidence.Reports say the two men sent one another more than 572,000 photos of their penises (the FBI has asked for a collective lobotomy after reviewing the evidence). Since the result was announced, Trump has been seen sitting in his penthouse suite in Trump Tower, repeatedly muttering, “Rosebud, rosebud.” (Rosebud, Melania has revealed, was her name for his penis. He thought it was because it smelled good.)Meanwhile President Clinton the second has appealed for calm (and help with setting up her White House email). As promised to the gods in return for ensuring her victory, she passes legislation that no member of the Kardashian family will be on TV again, ever. But trouble lies ahead: Ivanka, her heart filled with fury, vows to avenge her father. She doubles the size of her lifestyle website, which features coded messages that subliminally sow unrest and revolution. Due to their unwavering inability to resist luxury jeans and “handbag organisers”, Americans are soon fully indoctrinated.

For as long as David Olusoga has been writing and broadcasting on black British history (almost two decades), he has received infuriated letters from the public. Nowadays, there are tweets too, which employ the same fulminating tone.“The number of people who say, ‘I’m sick of hearing about slavery’, or ‘black people are always talking about slavery’. My response to them is ‘Name a British plantation. Name a slave trader. Name a British slave ship.’ Normally they can’t, because we don’t know that much about slavery. It’s not a central part of our national story.”Olusoga’s new book, Black and British: A Forgotten History, is not about slavery as such, but it is a radical reappraisal of the parameters of history, exposing lacunae in the nation’s version of its past. Domestic history cannot be separated from the vast former empire building, he argues, which was inextricably bound to the economics of global slavery. Joining up history at home and abroad makes it harder to gloss over Britain’s part in the slave trade.It also becomes harder to ignore the legion of black Britons who have lived on the Sceptred Isle since Roman times, rarely acknowledged in mainstream textbooks, but whose presence proves that there was never a “year zero” or a lost idyll of ethnic purity to which modern day nativists can hark back. “Black history is a series of missing chapters from British history,” he says. “I’m trying to put those bits back in.”Olusoga, 46, who started out at the BBC in 1998 as a researcher on Radio 4, is surely a “celebrity historian” in the making. He arrives in the hotel lobby for this interview fresh from Delhi, on his way to Mexico, in a sharp suit and with luggage in tow. He has an easy eloquence that is made for TV, speaking in perfectly formed, modulated sentences. His second book, The World’s War, won a Political Book award for “World War One Book of the Year” in 2015, no mean feat for a book published in the previous, centenary year (his first, The Kaiser’s Holocaust, looked at Germany’s colonial rule in Namibia). Meanwhile, his BBC2 series, Britain’s Forgotten Slave Owners, earned a Bafta this year. Having just finished book three, he has put the next one (about the global history of slavery) on hold in order to co-present Civilisations alongside Simon Schama and Mary Beard. It is a 10-part remake of Kenneth Clark’s landmark documentary series on the history of western art and thought, due on our screens next autumn.There has not been much sleep in the past four months, the time it took to write Black and British, in between filming the tie-in TV series. It was first conceived two years ago, when former BBC2 controller Janice Hadlow approached Olusoga. He could not have known then how the national climate would change. “Is the TV series and book being delivered in the same country that it was commissioned for?” he wonders. “I’m not entirely sure.”It is, he agrees, a fortuitously timed post-Brexit vote book. In it, Olusoga lists the flash points in modern black British history, from the unrest in 1919 when thousands in the country’s ports targeted local non-white communities, to the Cable Street riots attacking black sailors in London’s docklands, to the Notting Hill riots of 1958, and beyond. On each occasion, white communities turned on their black minority counterparts. Are we heading towards another flare-up of this kind? “I think we have the strength and the resourcefulness to confront parts of our history that are difficult and painful, but there’s also a dark side to British history and there was a flash of it this summer. We don’t know how deep or how serious it is yet.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   David Olusoga meeting school children in Cumbria during filming forBlack and British: A Forgotten History. Photograph: BBC/Des WillieThe change in tone, and chill in the air towards people of colour, has certainly been felt by him. “I’ve received tweets that I suspect people wouldn’t have sent in 2015. Is that a changed country or is that people who are unpleasant feeling emboldened to speak? We don’t know at the moment. As a historian, I always think you know what a moment was 20 years later.”Olusoga was born in Lagos to a white British mother and a Nigerian father who met in Newcastle as students. His parents separated when he was two years old and his mother returned with him and his three siblings to her home town in the north-east, to work as a linguist. A mixed-race family was a rarity in Newcastle in the early 80s, and Olusoga felt under attack every day, at school, on the streets: “People used to shout ‘National Front’ at us. And ‘wogs out’. It was routine, ubiquitous. There were men who would spit and shout. When we came out of school, we’d go to the bus stop and if there wasn’t a white person waiting, we’d walk to the next one because we knew the buses wouldn’t stop for black people. Sometimes we’d end up walking all the way home.”But one summer, when he was 14, the violence went off the scale. A brick was thrown into the family’s home wrapped in a note telling them to go back to Africa. A police officer had to be stationed outside their door for protection, until the family was eventually rehoused. “It was the summer from hell,” he says. “Afterwards, I think we did that thing you do when you’ve been through something together as a family – we stopped talking about it, because it was over, we’d got through it.”For this book, he opened up that conversation again and found some catharsis. It is heartening for him that his youngest siblings, born much later, can barely believe what it was like to be black and British then. “At my lowest moment, I wanted to leave the country. But it is no longer 1984. There has been too much integration. I was on a beach a few years ago, in the south of England, and I saw this guy who had bulldog tattoos, England flag tattoos – the sort of person I’d be really frightened of as a child – and he was with this mixed-race child who was clearly his granddaughter. It was such an amazing sight.”That summer didn’t scar him, Olusoga reflects, because his was a strong, close family and his mother pushed them hard to succeed at school, and at life. They moved to another council estate (which appears briefly in the film Get Carter – “I saw it many years later when I was a student, I was amazed to see Michael Caine wander past my bedroom window”) and their lives returned to normality.He later realised how the study of world history could help him make sense of that personal experience. He had always loved “great stories”, but over the years history “began to explain why things had happened to me and my family. It had answers. It made sense of the world and not just of my experiences but also why the north-east was the way it was, why those industries were there, why people felt the need to drive you out of your home, why some people could never accept the idea that I could be of this country, and be British.”He went to Liverpool University and then to Leicester for a master’s degree before rejecting the idea of a PhD – “becoming an academic, doing a PhD, felt to me like never leaving school”. He joined the BBC instead, met his partner in the canteen (she is a producer at the Natural History Unit), and wound up in the job of his dreams. “I only ever wanted to do history, and make documentaries.”Now, Olusoga wants to do more than rehabilitate lost or forgotten individuals. “I was trying to look at black British history beyond just biography,” he says, arguing that historians in the past have focused on the lives of black “heroes”, who remain on the margins. These exhumed figures need to be incorporated into mainstream history.One excavation that resonates with him is an image of a black sailor, on the south-facing bronze relief panel at the bottom of Nelson’s column in Trafalgar Square. The panel shows Nelson mortally wounded and the sailor standing close by, musket in hand.“He’s been there since the 1840s,” says Olusoga. “Think of all the things that have happened in Trafalgar Square since then – the mass union meetings, Keir Hardie’s speech, the CND marches, the poll tax riots. He was there to witness all that history and he’s there because he’s a representation of a norm – black sailors in the British navy. I think about what he’s witnessed, looking out at the changing world, watching Britain change.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A sketch of Francis Barber, a servant to Samuel Johnson, dating from around 1750 Photograph: Alamy Stock PhotoHe is indelible proof for Olusoga – carved into a monument to heroic nationalism – that black Britons belong inside British history, not on its side-lines. There are other memorable figures, such as the third century’s sub-Saharan African woman who grew up in East Sussex, and John Blanke, a trumpeter at Henry VIII’s coronation. He hopes one day that TV dramas or documentaries on the court might incorporate, even incidentally, the black Tudors we know were there. As part of his TV series he places plaques in various locations to commemorate moments or figures in black British history, including a plaque at Bunce Island in Sierra Leone, which was used as a slave fortress, and in Samuel Johnson’s home in honour of his Jamaican manservant, Francis Barber.The way that history is taught in schools and universities is telling half a story, Olusoga believes. What happened inside Britain cannot be separated from its global identity. “We were the biggest empire the world had ever seen. The idea that you can have a domestic history apart from it doesn’t make sense. Take the industrial revolution: the stories about spinning jennys and water frames are all part of our heritage. But where does the cotton being spun in those machines come from? At school, we went to mills and factories and nobody at any point in my education pointed out that the cotton processed in those mills was made by enslaved black Americans. When we talk about the history of the industrial revolution, the missing people in that revolution are the 1.8 million enslaved people who made that cotton. It was our biggest export and almost all of it came from the American deep south.” To fail to tell the story of these black Americans is, he thinks, “to tell a lie”.So should we talk about the historical guilt and shame of the coloniser and colonised, passed down through the generations? “No. I want to excise the words ‘guilt’ and ‘shame’ from the conversation. There is no one alive today who is a slave trader or a slave owner. I don’t think it’s about people feeling guilt or shame. It’s about acknowledgment, and it’s about truth and reconciliation. But I don’t even think we’ve done the truth bit yet.”• Black and British: A Forgotten History is published by Macmillan.

You can’t talk about any kind of media – any kind of technology – without talking about Marshall McLuhan, the Canadian intellectual who rivalled Warhol or Lennon or the acid guru Timothy Leary for notoriety in the 1960s. His career began in the early 1950s, but it took off in 1962 with his publication of The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man, closely followed by the extraordinary Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, in which he introduced his most famous maxim, “the medium is the message”.Is Donald Trump right that more British Muslims fight for Isis than the UK army? Read moreMcLuhan’s writing was dense with allusion and metaphor: he quoted freely from Shakespeare, Joyce and Yeats (“the visible world is no longer a reality and the unseen world is no longer a dream”), and was in no way afraid of ambiguity. Yet within this tapestry of ideas was something so elegant and elastic that it walks a path from then to now with ease – a unified theory of media that describes our relationship to its technologies in a single phrase; the E=mc2 of the information age. The medium is the message.McLuhan starts with a simple thought, then spirals outward in surprising ways. His imaginative leap involved seeing the media we create as “extensions of ourselves”, whose primary importance is to change not what we know, but our relationship to the world and the processes by which we act upon it; how we think, behave, dream and connect with other people. The medium is its own message, enabling and constraining in and of itself. “We shape our tools and thereafter they shape us,” he said.Through the hallucinatory fug of 2016 I’ve been thinking a lot about McLuhan – and never more than in the past fortnight, when the confluence of two apparently unrelated events suddenly struck me as significant. First a candidate for the American presidency threatened to repudiate an election result if he lost, opening a path to civil disobedience or violence on the part of his followers. I’m working in Los Angeles at the moment, and hearing this reminded me of the way two separate Americans recently offered sympathy for my having to live under sharia law in the UK, commiserating with the way Birmingham is now off-limits to all but Islamic State members and Jason Statham. When I told them that, unless this had occurred in the fortnight since I’d left, it wasn’t true, they looked me coolly in the eye and insisted it was – that I, who live in the UK, was mistaken.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Jon Hamm as Don Draper in Mad Men helped popularise new entertainment outlets such as HBO and Netflix. Photograph: Allstar/Lionsgate TelevisionHow on earth to make sense of this? Gentle probing revealed these people’s information to have come from Fox News and websites such as Breitbart, the same sources from which Trump’s world-view is cobbled together – news outlets neither I nor anyone I would trust to make my skinny soy decaf mochaccino with Peruvian cinnamon, or even to own a gun, ever sees.Then I heard news that Netflix, the US-based streaming network known for House of Cards and Orange is the New Black had rocked the stock market by announcing a huge and unexpected jump in subscribers during the third quarter of this year – 3.2m of these new subscribers were outside the US, many in Britain. At the end of 2015 5m UK households paid for Netflix, a figure projected to double by 2020. The company’s constituency is disproportionately young and upscale, according to the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board.Praise be to Don (Draper), I thought. When in the US, shows by Netflix and competitors such as HBO, Amazon, AMC and Hulu are now all I watch; in the UK almost all, as even the BBC’s willingness to take risks falls to a fragmenting audience, political pressure and the concomitant obsession with bums on seats. And this is good, n’est-ce pas? People whose education/outlook/experience disposes them to look for surprise and originality in their media have a place to go. People who want the comfort of predictability have their places, too. On a personal level, how could anyone lament a situation held to have brought a “golden age” of TV drama and panoply of diverse news sources, in which everyone gets exactly what they want?Pan back and the picture looks more complex. McLuhan began as an enthusiast for the “new electronic interdependence” he saw TV and (subsequently) the internet creating. The “global village”, he promised, would mimic the intimacy and sense of community surrendered to the alienations of the mechanical age, until “‘time’ has ceased, ‘space’ has vanished” and we live in a “simultaneous happening”. With broadcast TV, there was a case for this: early satellite pictures of the notorious Tet offensive are claimed to have turned public opinion against the Vietnam war in 1968, and the first moon landing a year later could not have made the impact it did but for TV.Citizens had to share the same few networks, tolerating others’ programmes and uniting regularly over favourites, be it Morecambe and Wise or Top of the Pops, which though usually crap, almost everyone watched together. Occasionally viewers would be surprised by programmes they didn’t think they would like, establishing fresh connections in the brain and with other people.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Buzz Aldrin walks on the moon on 20 July 1969, a media event that brought people together. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe quality and breadth of what we watch in 2016 is infinitely better, but the big picture experience might not be. We’re becoming strangers to one another, and with hindsight this isn’t surprising. When uptake of the pre-web internet began in the late 1980s, the global pooling of information – and wisdom – was much trumpeted. But if you talk to early adopters, most will say the net’s real wonder was in allowing them to commune with like-minded people everywhere, unfettered by geography.If you were an avant-garde jazz fan in Billericay, now you could find other fans to talk to, until before long you had your own virtual “community”. And unlike a physical space, you never had to leave this one, never had to interact with anyone you didn’t want to. Twenty-five years later, net algorithms will feed you material based entirely on your past, with no notion of a potential future; of growth or challenge. We’re all being reinforced, all the time, and it feels good – until we find ourselves on the sharp side of a Brexit vote.There seems little doubt that over two and a half decades, this atomisation has changed us – the medium has been the message – helping to create an environment in which superficially confounding phenomena such as Brexit and Donald Trump and the measurable rise of narcissism are perfectly logical, if not inevitable. Indeed, the provocative documentarian Adam Curtis goes one step further, suggesting in his new film HyperNormalisation that the new technology, far from having caused the fragmentation we see and feel, merely amplified a model of “radical individualism” that had been evolving since the late 1960s and is now dominant. In this model – an understandable reaction to the misuse of power by leaders in the 50s and 60s – truth to self becomes the ultimate and only truth, with self-expression its conveyor and personal preference the lone arbiter.It’s been said that with new technologies we tend to foresee the positives but be blindsided by the negatives. Can individual choice be a negative? When I set out to write my book Moondust, which involved tracking down the (then) nine surviving men who had walked on the moon, one of my questions was why some had fared well upon returning – spinning off at delightfully surprising tangents – and others not.In retrospect, it seems to me that those inclined to see their feats not as individual achievements, but as merely the most visible part of a shared collective effort, were more likely to integrate their experiences into productive lives thereafter. So in my opinion, the most empowering, liberating feeling a human can have is that in the scheme of things they’re unimportant, in service to something greater than themselves, with all the constraint to personal choice so entailed.TopicsNetflixOpinioncommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
“You don’t teach, you instruct.”Has anyone said that to you after one your lectures? No? It’s happened to me. In fact, if I had a pound for every time I’ve heard that statement, I would be well on the way to bridging the pay gap between academic and technical teaching staff.I am a technical instructor. It’s all about pushing buttons and pulling levers, isn’t it? I couldn’t even pronounce pedagogy, let alone deliver it. Many higher education institutes running practice-oriented degrees employ technical instructors to teach the areas not covered by the theory in the lecture rooms. My particular group of instructors is made up of people who have award-winning skills and real-world experience. We are not recent graduates. We are industry professionals who want to pass on our skills so that students are equipped for the workplace when they graduate.Practice makes perfect: how to become a vocational lecturer Read moreBut technical instructors get paid significantly less than academics. Research, scholarly activity, promotion opportunities and ridiculously long annual leave are not part of our contracts. We are placed in the same union as nurses, cleaners, call centre workers and security staff. We are in a lower social class than our “elite” academic colleagues.Did I mention that we have a different management structure from the entire academic team? This means that we don’t get shown the qualitative data from the National Student Survey, which points to the technical team as the strength of the course, year after year. Once, when I asked the academic manager to see the report, I was told it would “need a lot of editing” before I could see it. The thing is, we do see it, as we have ways to circumnavigate the system. We understand that “editing” really means trying to withhold negative comments about some of their staff. Plus it’s a bit awkward if it points to our technical team as a strength in the teaching and learning, as we are paid significantly less than academics.“Technical instructor” does sound a bit like “technician” and some people clearly don’t know the difference between the two. I am referred to as a technician on a daily basis. I can only assume this word association is why we are the first port of call whenever there is a technical problem with something menial, like PowerPoint slides. They don’t call on us with teaching problems, of course, although this would actually be more appropriate. After all, a lot of us are fellows of the Higher Education Academy and have far more teaching experience than a lot of academics.I am usually the first person through the door in the morning and the last to leave in the evening – that is what happens when your non-teaching hours are automatically technical support hours. Students know where we are based and we spend a lot of time talking them through course-based queries. At the end of my teaching sessions, I have a queue of students waiting at the door to ask questions. Students! Your lecturers are on strike because they are struggling to survive Read moreAll of these sessions are written by me, with no input from any course academic. They are steeped in context, theory, psychology and practice. But still, apparently, this is not teaching. I wonder about the elephant in the room. You wouldn’t find surgery being taught to medical students by someone who had never worked as a surgeon. But you do get academics who have never worked a day outside of HE teaching practice-oriented subjects. I’ve got a huge amount of respect for many of my academic colleagues who work tirelessly. But I also see the ones that let the side down.There are plenty of new training courses offering three-month diplomas in the same subjects as our degrees. They have partnerships with industry as well. They are busy and oversubscribed, even though they charge more than us. Their technical instructors, significantly, are called lecturers.There is a massive challenge ahead of us regarding the traditional models of courses and accreditation. The sector needs to appropriately recognise and reward the those who make a difference in the classroom. “Technical” is not a dirty word in industry and it should not be in higher education. Having two disjointed teaching teams is unhelpful and creates another political minefield that students have to navigate. There should be one equal teaching team made up of different skills: professors, academic theorists, researchers, technical lecturers, industry practitioners and talented classroom teachers. Students would have one port of call, leading to better communication and a better overall experience. If we sort this one out, we will be able to trump any other new training institution. How could they compete with that breadth of expertise?The recently deceased futurist writer, Alvin Toffler, said: “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.” It is about time universities do a bit of unlearning and let everyone relearn together, as a team.Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.

Donald Trump is threatening to sue movie theatres, reporters or anyone who repeats the allegations made in my new film You’ve Been Trumped Too? No surprise there. He threatened the BBC with the same before the broadcast of my first film, back in 2012. But what makes Trump’s latest threat all the more terrifying is that he could soon hold the keys to the White House. Can you imagine a world where the president of the United States was throwing around lawsuits just because he objected to what was printed or broadcast about him?You've Been Trumped Too review – this is what a Trump win would look like Read moreWelcome to the world we could wake up to on 9 November if Trump becomes the most powerful man on the planet. And if the polls are to be believed, it’s a step closer to becoming a reality.That’s why we as film-makers need to stand firm. We won’t be cowered by Trump’s legal threats and cyberbullying. That’s why we made You’ve Been Trumped Too available free to all voters in America on Thursday night ahead of its UK release. This is the film he doesn’t want you to see. And here’s why we think you should see it …Ten years ago, when several residents whose homes are located on the picturesque sand dunes of Balmedie in Scotland refused to sell their land to Trump for his new luxury golf course resort, the billionaire began a campaign of bullying and intimidation that continues to this day. Most well-known among these residents is farmer Michael Forbes, whose modest croft sits right in the middle of where Trump wanted to build “the greatest golf course in the world”. Michael’s mother Molly (now aged 92) lives in a caravan across the farmyard from her son. The home has a handmade carved sign on it, reading “Paradise”. That was, until Trump arrived. In 2010 I interviewed Michael Forbes on his fishing boat, and he mentioned in passing that they had no running waterTrump’s first attempt at being a great neighbour was to go on national television and slam the state of Michael Forbes’s farm. The farm was “a slum”, and Michael “lived like a pig”, fumed Trump. How could he possibly build his hotel for millionaires if the windows were to look out over “this horrible, horrible slum”?The hotel was part of Trump’s master plan for the Menie estate’s shifting sand dunes that would create “6,000 jobs”, see the building of 1,500 houses and the construction of a skyscraper hotel. Trump promised to get “Aberdeen booming”. His claims were lapped up by local politicians, eager to find an economic wand to wave for when North Sea oil runs dry. No problem if the residents refused to sell. Next up was his threat of eminent domain – or under UK law, compulsory purchase.So concerned was I at the lack of scrutiny of Trump’s plan and the devastating effect it would have on people and the rare sand dunes where he wanted to build his gated golf resort that I began making my film, You’ve Been Trumped.In the summer of 2010 I interviewed Michael Forbes on his salmon-fishing boat, and he mentioned in passing that they had no running water. Trump’s workers had apparently cut through a pipe leading from the spring that serves the Forbes’s well. The result was that Michael, his wife Sheila and Michael’s mother, Molly, were without running water. This had been going on for a week. And what had Trump done about it? Nothing, according to the Forbes.I went immediately to speak to the man in charge of Trump’s building work at the time to get the other side of the story. He confirmed that there was nobody trying to sort the problem out. He explained they had to “assess it first” so that it “would be a jewel of a system and sustain itself. It’ll be the best water system he’s ever had”.A short time later I was arrested along with my producer Richard Phinney, and we were thrown into an Aberdeen police cell. There we sat for hours while the police – apparently acting as a private security force for Trump – dreamed up some ludicrous charge. The charges were eventually dropped, and the police issued an apology. But still the Forbes’s water supply ran dry.'Whoever wins the US election needs to address the rage out there': the view from Middletown Read moreIn the years that followed I went back to the Forbes’s house. I made another film in 2014 called A Dangerous Game, for which Trump granted me an on-camera interview about the residents’ plight. When I filmed that interview in early 2013, I had no idea that Molly was still without a proper working water supply. She is a private person, a former land girl (member of the Women’s Land Army) during the second world war, and used to hardship.Throughout this extraordinary presidential campaign, countless articles have been written about the outrageous things that Donald Trump has said. But lesser known is what he has done. That’s why it’s so important for us to get You’ve Been Trumped Too out to US voters. It is a rare document of the impact on the lives of ordinary people of Trump’s actions.Mexico-style border walls? Check. Mistreatment of women? Check. Failure to deliver on promises? Check. And as for the Forbes’s water? When Trump announced he was running for the presidency in the summer of 2015, I was dumbfounded to discover Molly was still collecting water from a nearby stream because her water supply wasn’t working “all because of Trump”. Now that was a story I couldn’t ignore.• You’ve Been Trumped Too is released in UK cinemas on 4 November trumpedfilm.comTopicsDonald TrumpOpinionScotlandUS elections 2016US politicscommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Jonathan Freedland: the remain majority in the Commons makes it possibleSurely those who should be cheering today’s high court judgment the loudest are the people who have been the most passionate defenders of parliamentary sovereignty. So rejoice, Daniel Hannan: the judges have heeded your earnest plea to make parliament supreme. Put out the bunting, Michael Gove: your insistence that Westminster be the ultimate arbiter of our national affairs has been given the judicial seal of approval. Let all those who spent the spring trumpeting the glory of England, hailing it as the mother of parliaments, now celebrate their victory.Except, of course, they won’t. Those who campaigned for leave in the name of wresting power from Brussels to Westminster went strangely quiet when it came to the question decided by the court today: who has the power to trigger article 50? Suddenly they found that parliament was not quite so sacred or central – that some things were best left to ministers to decide. Well, the judges have called out that hypocrisy. They have decided that the Brexiteers should have to comply with their own logic – and bow to parliament.Does that mean, as Nigel Farage has said he fears, that a “betrayal” is imminent – that parliament might opt for a “half Brexit”, as the former Ukip leader put it, or even that it might halt Brexit altogether? You can see why that’s a possibility: the remain camp still has a majority in the Commons, when you add up not just Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats but also the estimated 185 Tory MPs who wanted to stay in the EU. If they all united and voted as they did on 23 June, they could block Brexit tomorrow.They won’t do that. Too many would regard it as a constitutional offence to go against the public’s verdict delivered in the referendum. Others have a more practical fear of contradicting the wishes of their own local electorate, anxious they would pay the price with their own seats.Who are the judges who ruled that MPs should vote on Brexit? Read moreBut that fear will only fully kick in if Theresa May presents them with a straight, up-or-down choice: a one-line motion to trigger article 50 or not. If the choice is any less stark than that, if May proposes detailed legislation – then that would give anti-Brexit MPs plenty of wriggle room. They could say that while the public voted to leave, they did not vote for this kind of leave. That would give the remain majority in parliament the chance to slow things down and demand a much softer Brexit.Two other factors could prove decisive. The coherence of Labour in parliament now matters. If the party can get its act together and unite around, say, the demand that Britain remains a member of the single market then it will have real muscle. The early signs were not encouraging: recall that the first public figure to demand the immediate triggering of article 50 was Jeremy Corbyn, hours after the vote. But Keir Starmer and others have set a good lead: Labour needs to press the case against hard Brexit strongly and coherently.The other thing to remember is that parliament is not just the Commons. The Lords will have a say too. Unelected peers thwarting the will of the people may look like a democratic outrage. But Gove, Hannan and the rest can hardly complain. The Lords are an ancient part of our parliament. And parliament – as they never stopped reminding us – is sovereign.Dreda Say Mitchell: If MPs attempt to overturn Brexit, public trust will fall even furtherFor those of us who voted leave in order to ensure that it’s our MPs who make political decisions in this country, this morning’s ruling in the high court is a nice irony. I personally don’t have a problem with anyone using any democratic or legal means to achieve any political end they want. And there’s no doubt that MPs have the right to cancel Brexit if they choose to do so.But I would advise them to use their power respectfully and wisely. The reputation of the political classes in this country is already very low, and any attempt to overturn the referendum result is likely to send it down even further with baleful consequences.Whether it’ll make any difference in the long run is a moot point. There are powerful vested interests in the UK already at work to get the ballot overturned or render it meaningless. There are equally powerful interests in the EU itself who are willing to help them out. Personally, I wouldn’t bet against them succeeding. As the French, Dutch, Irish and Greeks have discovered, referendums in the EU are flexible friends. But that will leave a pertinent question – do votes actually count for anything in Europe these days, or are they merely glorified opinion polls?Tim Farron: the public must get a say on the final Brexit dealGiven the Conservative party’s long-standing commitment to the principles of parliamentary representative democracy, it is disappointing that today’s decision had to be made in the court. Ironically, a failure to consult elected representatives of the public on the terms of the negotiation package would undermine the very principles that David Davis, Boris Johnson and Liam Fox have championed. Hopefully, this will provide some much-needed clarity on what has been a completely chaotic showing from the government so far.It will be vital that parliament now works productively together to get the best possible negotiating deal to take to Europe. Given the strict two-year timetable of exiting the EU once article 50 is triggered, it is critical that the government now lays out its negotiations to parliament, before such a vote is held. So far, May’s team have been all over the place when it comes to prioritising what is best for Britain, and it’s time they pull their socks up and start taking this seriously.Ultimately, the British people voted for a departure but not for a destination, which is why what really matters is allowing them to vote again on the final deal, giving them the chance to say no to an irresponsible hard Brexit that risks our economy and our jobs.Schona Jolly: The government’s appeal is unlikely to succeed      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Prime minister Theresa May. Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty ImagesThe government has announced that it will appeal against a judgment by a UK court that restores sovereignty to the UK parliament to legislate for the UK’s legal landscape. Even for the sake of appearances, that just looks bad. The Vote Leave camp campaigned for sovereignty to be restored to the UK parliament. It is symptomatic of their many inconsistencies that they now argue that this crucial decision ought not to be taken by parliament.Brexit has caused havoc already. Now parliament must save us | Polly Toynbee Read moreDuring three days of legal argument, the writing was on the wall for the government when it was forced to make the significant concession that article 50 is both unconditional and irrevocable. That might be true politically, but it is at least open to challenge legally. The irony of the government’s appeal is that it now opens up the Pandora’s box of whether the article 50 question on irreversibility can be answered only by the European court of justice. If so, what sort of delay will that entail?In my view, the government has poor prospects of succeeding in the supreme court. The high court’s key reasoning is that the government “cannot without the intervention of parliament confer rights on individuals or deprive individuals of rights”. There is no answer to this. The removal of the ability to seek authoritative rulings of the European court, for example, is but one material change in our law, and it may have a profound impact on fundamental and social rights. So, too, other major rights merely “glossed over” by the government’s arguments. I don’t see a comeback to the various fatal gaps in the government’s reasoning, which the court found to be flawed.The most fundamental rule of UK constitutional law is that parliament is sovereign, and that legislation enacted by both Houses of Parliament is supreme. If “Brexit means Brexit”, the court has confirmed that only parliament can trigger it. Both Houses of Parliament now need to stand up for the national interest and demand accountability from the executive, and for their constituents. The courts have done their bit for the rule of law. Parliament, on behalf of all of us, now needs to do the same.David Lammy: This is what taking back control really meansToday’s ruling is a huge victory for our parliamentary democracy. This is what real sovereignty looks like, and this is what taking back control really means.This decision is about parliamentary sovereignty and our constitution. It is not about leave or remain – it is actually about whether we have a sovereign parliament in this country, and as such the decision is the right one.We got a Bill of Rights in 1689 which gave parliament powers and took power away from the executive and the monarch. Those who wanted to leave the EU campaigned on the basis of parliamentary sovereignty, so it would have been completely inconceivable for the executive to overreach its prerogative powers and trigger article 50 without any form of parliamentary scrutiny or approval.Parliament specifically legislated to hold an advisory, non-binding referendum, so it is now important that the government puts its plans before parliament so that MPs can scrutinise these plans before the decision on triggering article 50 and beginning the Brexit process.Anand Menon: This ruling won’t halt Brexit, but further legitimise itKeep calm, everyone. Today’s high court ruling does not mean parliament will prevent Brexit. They won’t and, what is more, they shouldn’t. Why won’t they? Well, first, because they may not get a chance to. The judgment is not the end of the story, there is an appeal to come. But let’s assume the supreme court upholds the verdict. Parliament then would have a right to vote on the triggering of article 50. Will they use this opportunity to block the process? Almost certainly not.Of the 650 MPs, 479 are reckoned to have backed remain (including over half of Conservative MPs). So there was, prior to the referendum, a parliamentary majority in favour of remaining. But things have changed since 23 June. For one thing, elected representatives were shown to be out of touch with their voters: 421 of 574 English and Welsh parliamentary constituencies voted to leave. Polling suggests, moreover, that significantly more than 50% of 2015 Conservative voters and more than 30% of Labour voters backed leave. Voting against a referendum result generated by many of their own voters is not something many MPs would willingly countenance doing.High court Brexit ruling: what does it all mean? Read moreThe most parliament seems likely to do is to impose procedural conditions on the prime minister. These may include the need to report back regularly on the negotiations – providing the kind of running commentary she has resisted to date. Yet even then, it is hard to see how MPs can materially affect the final outcome. Article 50 lays down a two-year deadline. Once a deal is struck, they will face a choice between whatever Theresa May has achieved and no deal at all. There will be no scope to modulate what is on the table.And this is as it should be. It’s not as if politics was held in high regard before the referendum. I shudder to think what would happen if, following a unique democratic moment that mobilised the population in a way even elections fail to, a parliament that had approved the legislation providing for the vote decided to overturn it because it had come up with the “wrong” answer.And so to the final irony. The chances are this ruling will not halt Brexit, but further legitimise it. A judgment hailed by remainers will, ultimately, serve merely to place a parliamentary stamp of approval on an outcome they oppose.TopicsBrexitThe panelEuropean UnionForeign policyArticle 50commentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
WONDERFUL COPENHAGENIf you were expecting today’s Fiver to add to the football world’s slight over-reaction to a solitary Manchester City victory over a Barcelona side missing three first-choice players, including its midfield heartbeat, we’re afraid we’re going to have to let you down. With Leicester on the verge of qualifying for Big Cup’s knockout stages in the home country of Hans Christian Andersen, we’d rather focus on their particular fairytale, what with Claudio Ranieri’s men having beaten each of their Group G rivals already and now looking set fair to qualify for the knockout stages with two games to spare. Leicester are the most popular champions in living memory, have yet to concede a goal in Big Cup and are managed by a man who spent Monday night sitting by his front door handing out sweets to trick-or-treaters. He has also just been nominated for the Fifa men’s coach-of-the-year award, on a 10-man shortlist boasting nine other blokes who the Fiver suspects won’t be rushing to draft acceptance speeches “just in case”.Leicester’s Claudio Ranieri keeps focus as Copenhagen fairytale beckons Read moreThe last time this Leicester squad visited Copenhagen they were on a Christmas jolly and dressed as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles among other cartoon characters. Tonight they will take the field in equally fantastical garb, wearing the costumes of Premier League champions and attempting to beat a Copenhagen team that has not lost any of its past 28 matches at home. “I understand everybody wants to win [against Copenhagen] but for us it’s important that we have everything in our hands,” said Ranieri. “We can write a new chapter of the Leicester story but maybe it’s not [on Wednesday]. It’s important to concentrate because Copenhagen are well organised. I respect them a lot. But we are very close to achieving something special.”Meanwhile at Wembley, goal-shy Spurs will entertain Bayer Leverkusen in a group nobody seems particularly keen on escaping. A win for Mauricio Pochettino’s men would put some serious daylight between them and their German rivals, but could prove tricky for a side that, despite playing fairly well, has failed to win any of its past five games. One of those making up the numbers on that Fifa shortlist for the Ranieri Award, Pochettino has ordered his players to make the prospect of playing at Wembley an ordeal, rather than an inspiration, for their opponents. “It’s our responsibility to create the atmosphere, that says ‘OK, it’s an exciting thing to come here and play at Wembley but it will be tougher for you too to play against Tottenham, because you play against 90,000 supporters that are very excited and bring all of their energy to us’,” he said. If those 90,000 can muster as much enthusiasm as their England counterparts when the national team plays at home, the Fiver can only conclude that Spurs are doomed.LIVE ON BIG WEBSITEJoin Barry Glendenning live at 7.45pm on Big Website for Tottenham 2-1 Leverkusen while Jacob Steinberg will be on hand for FC Copenhagen 0-0 Leicester City.QUOTE OF THE DAY“I would like to leave this damn country as soon as possible.” – just one of the alleged zingers from Smouha manager Jorvan Vieira in a leaked transcript, published in the Egyptian media and resulting in an invitation to exit the door marked Do One.

Walter Hain “stumbled” into the anti-apartheid struggle, according to his son, the politician Peter Hain, who in 2014 wrote a memoir of his father and mother, Ad & Wal: Values, Duty, Sacrifice in Apartheid South Africa. Peter wrote of his parents: “At the time, in 1953, it just seemed the right thing to do, in keeping with their values of caring, decency, fairness and, perhaps equally important, their sense of duty.”That was when Walter, who has died aged 91, and his wife, Adelaine, joined the newly formed Liberal party – the only non-race-based political grouping in South Africa. Then living in Ladysmith, the couple helped to organise the inaugural meeting of the party’s local branch and ended up holding it at their home. The author Alan Paton, the party’s national president, attended that first meeting.The following year the family moved to Pretoria. Walter worked as an architect, while Adelaine became an unpaid political organiser. She made illegal trips into black townships to visit party members, and supported activists who had been arrested, helping them to find legal representation, and sending food to their families when they were imprisoned. When I met the couple in 2007, to write an article marking Adelaine’s 80th birthday, they gave me a nightmare description of the South Africa of the 1950s: prisoners taken to the jail in Pretoria could be sold to farmers as cheap labour, and a black servant not carrying his pass papers could be arrested merely for stepping outside his employer’s front garden.As the repression worsened in the early 1960s, the Hains became even more active politically. Adelaine attended the trial of Nelson Mandela and his co-defendants in Pretoria, and was at times their sole supporter in the whites-only gallery. That in turn made the Hains the target of a paranoid regime.In 1963 Adelaine was “banned” – a draconian measure forbidding all political activity and making her, in effect, a non-person. Walter faced the same treatment a year later. They were the first couple to be banned, and an unprecedented codicil had to be added to their banning order allowing them to communicate with each other.Walter’s banning order followed the support he had given to the couple’s close friend John Harris, who in 1964 had planted a bomb at the railway station in Johannesburg, killing an elderly woman. In his book, Peter Hain alleges the authorities deliberately ignored Harris’s phoned warning in order to use the resulting carnage for political ends.The Hains were opposed to violent action because they believed it was counter-productive, but they remained supportive of Harris, a fellow Liberal party member who had joined the African Resistance Movement and had come to believe that only violence could shake the apartheid system, although he always denied he had intended to kill. Harris was hanged for murder in April 1965, the only white person to be executed in apartheid South Africa for political activities. The Hains helped his wife, Ann, and their baby son during the months of his imprisonment and took them into their home after his death. Harris had wanted Walter to give the oration at his funeral, but because Walter was banned he was unable to do so. Peter, who was 15 at the time, read it instead.Walter’s banning order meant he could no longer work as an architect in South Africa, so in 1966 he and his family left for the UK. They settled in London, where they became prominent opponents of the South African government. They supported the anti-apartheid movement, helping Peter with his Stop the 70 Tour campaign, which succeeded in blocking the all-white South African cricket team from coming to Britain in 1970. They also backed their son when he faced a trial for conspiracy in 1972 and trumped-up bank robbery charges in 1976.The South African secret police continued to target activists in exile. The Hains’ phone was tapped and in 1972 they received a letter bomb, addressed to Peter but sent to their home. It was opened by their daughter Sally, but did not explode.Walter was born in Durban. His father, also called Walter, and his mother, Mary, hailed from Glasgow, and in 1920 had emigrated to South Africa, where Walter Sr worked as an engineer. In 1935 they moved to Pretoria, and Walter attended Pretoria Boys high school, where he developed a lifelong love of sport.He also learned to sketch at school – a skill he put to good use in the second world war, when he joined the Signal Corps at the age of 18 and took part in the allied assault on Italy. He kept a diary during the campaign, illustrated with pencil sketches. In 2015 he published them in a book called Apennine War Diary.Walter was wounded in the advance, but recovered and was assigned to the Natal Mounted Rifles. He was still in Italy when Germany surrendered on 8 May. In his book about his parents, Peter says the war was a “profoundly formative experience” for his father, “both changing him and enlarging his perspective on life to one so much broader than that of a home-grown, young, white South African”.After the war, Walter took up the place to study architecture at Witwatersrand University that he had gained before joining up in 1942. Though studying in Johannesburg, he still liked to pay regular visits to his parents in Pretoria, and on one of those visits, while out riding with a group of friends, he met Adelaine Stocks. The couple married in 1948, initially living in Nairobi, Kenay, where Walter had found a job in an architectural practice. Peter, their eldest son, was born there in 1950.It was in Nairobi that the Hains exhibited the first flickerings of their political rebelliousness. “India had just got independence,” Walter recalled, “and a whole lot of [British] ex-Indian army people had come to Kenya, where black people were still kept in their place. One of the partners in the firm that I was working for said to me, ‘Oh, we must learn from you South Africans. You know how to treat the blacks.’ I had a hell of an argument with him.”Walter described himself and Adelaine as political “late developers”. “It was very lucky because we both felt the same,” he said. “It would have been awkward if we’d developed differently.”Exiled to the UK after their decade-long struggle in South Africa, they settled in Putney, south-west London, where Walter played cricket until he was 80. The couple were also passionate supporters of Chelsea football club – their sole accommodation with oligarchical power. In 2009 they moved to Neath, south Wales, to be close to Peter, who was the town’s MP until he stepped down in 2015.Walter and Adelaine returned to South Africa on three occasions, the first visit immediately after the end of apartheid in 1994 to do “a whip-round of the whole country to see as many of our old friends as possible whom we didn’t think we’d see again”. On that trip, Walter had something of an epiphany – in a toilet. “We stopped at a garage on the road from Cape Town to Port Alfred to put petrol in. I went to the loo, and was standing at the urinal. Somebody came to the next urinal and I looked at him. He was black. I knew then that things really had changed.”Walter is survived by Adelaine, their children, Peter, Tom, Jo-anne and Sally, 11 grandchildren, 18 great-grandchildren and a great-great-grandchild.• Walter Hain, architect and political activist, born 29 December 1924; died 14 October 2016TopicsPoliticsArchitectureLondonWalesobituariesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Yumi Wong adores the latest addition to her southern California home: a lush, emerald lawn.“It just looks much nicer with all the green. It feels clean and peaceful,” she said on Tuesday, padding across the 2,800-sq-ft grass expanse. “I thought about artificial turf but I just wanted the real stuff back.”It arrived last week, a boon for her two children, two dogs and tortoise, and fitted right into Rancho Cucamonga, a neighbourhood east of Los Angeles. “Here nobody on the street has got rid of grass,” said Wong, 36, a physician’s assistant.They did not do so because California’s great grass purge seems to have faltered. A punishing drought triggered mandatory water restrictions last year and seemingly turned lawns into an enemy of the state. Thousands were ripped up. Vigilantes “drought shamed” reprobates who maintained verdant lawns. The ideal was brown lawns, or no lawns.On the hunt for 'moral breaches' with California's foremost drought-shamer Read moreSouthland Sod Farms, a big turf supplier, saw orders plunge from a high of 500 a day to just 80. One customer requested a clandestine delivery to avoid shaming. Critics called the company an environmental vandal. A Facebook post compared it to the Nazis.Now, however, Southland Sod Farms is delivering about a hundred lawns daily across Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego and is cautiously optimistic about the future. “This panic to drive lawns out – that only went so far,” said owner Jurgen Gramckow. “Deep down inside people appreciate the recreational and aesthetic value of lawns.”He talked up grass’s environmental benefits – absorbing greenhouse gas, cooling air temperature, impeding soil erosion – and his clients’ conservation efforts. Wong, for instance, used to have an even bigger lawn until drought fried it. She compromised and replaced about half of it with drought-tolerant landscaping and the rest with the new lawn.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Norm Lopez, a sales rep for Southland Sod Farms, on the lawn of one of his clients. Photograph: Noah Smith for the GuardianSome clients install lawns only in backyards, hidden from the street, Gramckow said. “They want to look like they’re doing their social responsibility by not having a lawn out front.” Other, bolder souls say, in effect, sod it. “With these folks it’s: my world begins on my property line, and stay out of it.”This year is on track to be the hottest ever recorded and California is enduring a fifth parched year, but anecdotal evidence suggests lawn lust, the California love that dare not speak its name, is indeed back. Horrified landscapers and conservation activists have reported spotting new lawns around LA and San Diego. “You see them going in. I always stop and stare and think, what are you doing, are you really that clueless?” said Marilee Kuhlmann, a landscape consultant and president of Urban Water Group.“Some people are choosing to keep their lawns and just pay the [water] bill. I guess they want it bad enough,” said Andrew Ferguson, a landscaper with Terroir Malibu. He recently spotted what appeared to be a new 20,000-sq-ft lawn in Malibu. “It boggles my mind.”Brook Sarson, who runs H2OME, a water conservation company, said some residents simply denied the realities of a Mediterranean climate. “People think, ‘Oh it’s just a little lawn, what else can I do to save water?’ I think in San Diego and LA we just have this entitlement – I want what I want.”Bob Pool, 62, a Beverly Hills lawn owner and screenwriter, thinks there is no need to purge lawns until climate change’s impact is clearer. “I think eventually we’ll have to get rid of lawns but I’d be hesitant to jump the gun,” he said, while admiring lush gardens in Santa Monica. Panic – a topic he explored in Outbreak and Armageddon –will not benefit LA’s landscape, he said.Wyatt Shattuck, 24, a construction worker, approved of lawns for public spaces – he was eating lunch on one – but lamented that wealthy clients were keeping private lawns.Esther Margulies, assistant director of landscape architecture and urbanism at the University of Southern California, said the urgency felt last year yielded some positive results, such as greater use of drip irrigation and solar panels, but that neighborhoods with big properties showed little change. “The lawns remain the norm.” Drought shaming, which ranged from aerial photos of celebrities’ lawns to people tweeting photos of neighbours’ sprinklers, has receded.Tony Corcoran, who pedals around west LA documenting water profligacy in YouTube videos, thinks shamelessness is trumping shaming.“I have only seen a small reduction in yards used for grass,” he said, “and in many cases I see so much foliage planted that it is not in any way reducing the water used.”Yet just a year ago there was a war on lawns. State-funded ad campaigns urged no watering with slogans such as “Brown is the new green”. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD) doubled its rebate from $1 to $2 for home and business owners to remove grass, to such enthusiastic response the budget for it didn’t last long.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Yumi Wong outside her home. Photograph: Noah Smith for the GuardianThen two things happened.Some homeowners who had replaced lawns with drought-tolerant landscaping hated the result: gravel with a smattering of succulents, yarrow and other plants. Often the plants died, giving way to weeds.Another lawn alternative – artificial turf – lost some luster when CBS2 reported that LA’s department of water and power, which is tasked with punishing water wasters, watered fake grass at its substations. The reason? Wash out dog pee.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  In 2015, the Guardian looked at the rising trend of fake grass in California: ‘We all do it because we want to live in a beautiful neighborhood’The second, more consequential event happened in June: the State Water Resources Control Board relaxed last year’s requirement for a 25% cut in Californians’ overall urban water use after winter rains had partly replenished reservoirs and snowpack.Homes and businesses used 18.3% less water in September compared with the same month in 2013, according to figures released on Tuesday. Quite a slide from the 26.2% savings achieved in September 2015, but still enough, according to water officials, to show that conservation can work without mandatory restrictions.When in drought: the California farmers who don’t water their crops Read moreThere is some evidence for that. Mary Fisher, president of California’s Association of Professional Landscape Designers, said her clients and other home owners in the San Francisco Bay Area were committed to conservation. “People realise a big green lawn doesn’t equal prosperity and beauty. It equals wastefulness.”But Ferguson, the landscaper, said that with less financial incentive to abandon lawns more people would keep them. “Easing restrictions was a huge mistake. It sent the wrong message that this isn’t really an emergency any more. When people hear that they just crank up the water.”There is no end in sight to chronic water shortage. One study has warned that the current drought, the most intense ever recorded, could become California’s “new normal”.Having supplied sod for hundreds of thousands of lawns over the decades, Jurgen Gramckow believes they will continue to adorn California’s landscape, purge or no purge. “All we hear about is more conservation, more conservation. At some point people say enough.”TopicsCalifornia droughtCaliforniaDroughtHome improvementsWaterfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
In 1936, Dutch geologist Jean Jacques Dozy climbed the world’s highest island peak: the forbidding Mount Carstensz, a snow-covered silver crag on what was then known as Dutch New Guinea. During the 4,800-metre ascent, Dozy noticed an unusual rock outcrop veined with green streaks. Samples he brought back confirmed exceptionally rich gold and copper deposits.Today, these remote, sharp-edged mountains are part of West Papua, Indonesia, and home to the Grasberg mine, one of the biggest gold mines – and third largest copper mine – in the world. Majority-owned by the American mining firm Freeport McMoRan, Grasberg is now Indonesia’s biggest taxpayer, with reserves worth an estimated $100bn (£80bn).But a recent fact-finding mission (by the Brisbane Archdiocese’s Catholic Justice and Peace Commission) described a “slow-motion genocide” (pdf) taking place in West Papua, warning that its indigenous population is at risk of becoming “an anthropological museum exhibit of a bygone culture”. West Papua locatorSince the Suharto dictatorship annexed the region in a 1969 UN referendum largely seen as a fixed land grab, an estimated 500,000 West Papuans have been killed in their fight for self-rule. Decades of military and police oppression, kidnapping and torture have created a long-standing culture of fear. Local and foreign journalists are routinely banned, detained, beaten and forced to face trial on trumped-up charges. Undercover police regularly trail indigenous religious, social and political leaders. And children still in primary school have been jailed for taking part in demonstrations calling for independence from Indonesia.“There is no justice in this country,” whispered one indigenous villager on condition of anonymity, looking over his shoulder fearfully. “It is an island without law.”****Dozy had not set out to find gold in 1936; his goal was to scale the region’s highest glacial peak. But his discovery sparked the interest of Freeport Sulphur – later to become Freeport Minerals Company and then, through a 1981 merger with the McMoRan Oil and Gas Company, Freeport McMoRan – whose board of directors included the well-connected Godfrey Rockefeller (serving from 1931 until the early 1980s) and Henry Kissinger (1988-1995).Today, indigenous tribes such as the Kamoro and the Amungme claim their communities have been racked with poverty, disease, oppression and environmental degradation since the mine began operations in 1973.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Chief of the Kamoro people, Hironimus Urmani, in Tipuka, close to the Grasberg mine.“We are a coastal people, and we depend on the environment,” says the Kamoro’s chief, Hironimus Urmani, in Tipuka, a lowland village down-river from the Grasberg mine. “Nature is a blessing from God, and we are known by the three Ss: sago [trees], sampan [canoes] and sungai [rivers]. But life is very difficult now.”Urmani motions to the river opposite, languishing green and motionless. He claims that tailing sediment from the mine has raised the riverbed, suffocating the fish, oysters and shrimp on which the Kamoro diet and economy are traditionally based. A 2012 report from Earthworks and MiningWatch Canada asserts that mine waste from Grasberg has “buried over 166 square kilometres of formerly productive forest and wetlands, and fish have largely disappeared”. Although most Kamoro still try to eke out a living fishing and foraging for food, they struggle to find paid work, says Urmani. “We need to earn money. But now we face major competition from non-Papuan migrants.”Locals fear that the government’s controversial transmigration programme, which resettles Indonesians from high-density islands such as Java to low-population areas, is wiping out their population completely. Indigenous Melanesian Christians – they comprised 96% of the population in 1971 (pdf) – now make up a 48% minority, with numbers expected to fall to 29% by 2020 if migration rates continue.West PapuaClashes between the indigenous Christians – and migrant Indonesian Muslims – have also resulted in riots, fires and injuries.“Land has been taken away, directly by Freeport … and indirectly, as the Indonesian settlers have appropriated it,” says Dr Agus Sumule, professor of agricultural socio-economics at the University of Papua.“The stresses [on indigenous people] are intense,” says Sumule. “They have been very negatively impacted.”The Indonesian government signed over to Freeport the right to extract mineral wealth from the Grasberg site in West Papua in 1967. A 2002 report from the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) details that land agreements were not negotiated with the Amungme until 1974, a year after the mine opened, and with the Kamoro in 1997. The compensation paid for Kamoro and Amungme land has been mainly in the form of communal benefits, such as the building of homes, schools and places of worship. The IIED report notes, “Perceptions of land rights and historic compensation claims are a continuing source of dissatisfaction and conflict in the mining area.”Recent census data shows Papua’s GDP per capita at $3,510, compared to the Indonesian average of $2,452. Yet Papua has the highest poverty rate in the country, nearly three times the national average. It also has the highest infant, child and maternal mortality rates in Indonesia, as well as the worst health indicators, and the poorest literacy rates.The scale of destitution is best observed from the highland Amungme village of Banti, just 20 miles down from the Grasberg mine.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The river Aikwa, near Banti, is turned thick and silver with the tailings from the mine. Here, artisanal miners pan the tailings for gold.Estimates from Earthworks suggest that Freeport dumps as much as 200,000 tonnes of mine waste, known as tailings, directly into the Aikwa delta system every day. The practice has devastated the environment, according to Earthworks and locals, turning thousands of hectares of verdant forest and mangroves into wasteland and rendering turgid the once-crystal waters of the highlands.The tailings from the Grasberg mine are so rich with ore that Papuans walk for as long as a week to get here. Crowding the length of the river and the delta wasteland, thousands of unlicensed panners shore up small sections to slow the river’s flow and dig into the thick sediment on the side. Although some of these panners are located within Freeport’s official mining operations, they are not evicted or controlled in any way, they said. Instead, they claim they sell their findings to the police and military who work as security on the mine. (An anonymous Freeport source also confirmed this).One of the panners, Martine Wandango, 25, bends over her pail of water as she filters out rocks and searches for ore. “You can only survive with money, and you can only find money from gold,” says Martine, who followed her husband to the delta 15 years ago by walking 60 miles over the mountains from their remote highland village.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Aikwa river, which used to provide the Kamoro people with the staples of their existence.“I work really hard as I want to give my children better lives, so they can go to school. But it isn’t enough, so she helps me here mining,” says Martine of her daughter, nine, who swings a gold pan in her hands. “On a good day, I can get three grammes, which I sell either to the police or [to buyers] in Timika.”A tiny village when Freeport arrived here 40 years ago, Timika is now a boom town dotted with bars, brothels, gold-processing shops and various military personnel. Under Indonesian law, Freeport is a designated “strategic industry”, which mandates that external security for the mine, its access roads and its pipelines all be provided exclusively by Indonesia’s security forces. Freeport has never been implicated in any human rights abuses allegedly committed by the Indonesian military in Papua. Freeport McMoRan, based in Phoenix, Arizona, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The company’s website defends its method of disposal of tailings at Grasberg, managed by PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI), an affiliate company: “PTFI’s controlled riverine tailings management system, which has been approved by the Indonesian government, uses the unnavigable river system in the mountainous highlands near our mine to transport tailings to an engineered area in the lowlands where the tailings and other sediments are managed in a deposition area.”A 2009 report by the company says it utilises levees to contain tailings in the deposition area, and that the tailings management programme costs Freeport McMoRan $15.5m (£12.7m) each year. According to the report, company monitoring of aquatic life in the rivers found that fish and shrimp were suitable for consumption, as regulated by Indonesian food standards, while water quality samples met Indonesian and US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards for dissolved metals. In a 2011 BBC report on alleged pollution in the area surrounding Grasberg, the company says that the tailings management method was chosen because studies showed the environmental impact caused by its waste material was reversible.Elsewhere on its website, the company says: “We are committed to respecting human rights. Our human rights policy requires us (and our contractors) to conduct business in a manner consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to align our human rights due diligence practices with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles).”The company also emphasises its work with indigenous people in West Papua. A 2015 Freeport McRoRan report on working towards sustainable development said: “PTFI has engaged with indigenous Papuan tribes for decades, including through numerous formal agreements to promote workforce skills training, health, education and basic infrastructure development … In 2015, PTFI continued to evaluate the effectiveness of alternate options for Kamoro community members whose estuary transport routes are impacted by sedimentation associated with the controlled riverine tailings management system. Provision of smaller sized boats, in addition to 50 passenger vessels, for route flexibility as well as additional local economic development programmes were identified as additional mitigation measures during the year.”Back in the area surrounding the Grasberg mine, many Papuans, struggling for work, find themselves pulled into the bar and sex industries that cater to the miners, particularly around the highland village of Banti. Here brothels and bars line up side by side, allegedly with help from the Indonesian military, who are said to supply sex workers and alcohol, according to a Freeport source who wished to remain anonymous.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Inside a brothel complex in Timika, West Papua. HIV rates in the region are of ‘epidemic’ proportions,according to the UN, 15 times higher than anywhere else in Indonesia.Indigenous chiefs have watched as a newfound promiscuity has brought sexually transmitted infections that have ravaged their communities. “Traditional Papuan culture forbids free sex, but alcohol makes our communities vulnerable,” says the Amungme chief, Martin Mangal. “And brothels make it easy to contract HIV.” HIV rates in West Papua are of “epidemic” proportions, according to the UN, 15 times higher than anywhere else in Indonesia. Driven almost entirely by unsafe sex, HIV is also far more prevalent among indigenous Papuans. Yet the existence of only one hospital – built by Freeport – means that most people, particularly those in remote highland villages, don’t get the help they need.Late last year, the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, claimed he was willing to work towards a “better Papua”: “I want to listen to the people’s voices.”However, human rights violations have actually increased since Widodo took power, according to Indonesia’s Commission for the Disappeared and Victims of Violence (Kontras), which has logged 1,200 incidents of harassment, beatings, torture and killings of Papuans by Indonesian security forces since his election in 2014.The Indonesian government did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The country’s military has consistently denied any wrongdoing in Papua.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Tribes from across the region have come to Banti in order to exploit the artisanal mining of the river, causing significant disruption to life in the village.Despite everything, there have been small glimmers of hope. This summer, Dutch human rights law firm Prakken D’Oliveira submitted a formal legal complaint against Indonesia to the UN Human Rights Council, accusing the government of “long-term, widespread and systematic human rights violations” and the “complete denial of the right to self-determination of the people of West-Papua”.Later this year, West Papua is expected to be granted full membership of the Melanesian Spearhood Group, an important sub-regional coalition of countries including Fiji, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea.The Brisbane commission, which warned of the risk of genocide, is calling on Indonesia to allow Papua, once and for all, the right to self-determination.Yet some fear the opportunity for change in Papua is long gone.“Is healing even possible?” asked Professor Agus Sumule, shaking his head. “It could be too late.”TopicsNatural resources and developmentWest PapuaIndonesiaConflict and developmentAsia PacificSustainable development goalsfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
A US cybersecurity firm hired by a Russian bank to investigate allegations of a secret line of communication with the Trump Organization said on Tuesday there was no evidence so far of substantive contact, email or financial links. Mandiant, which is owned by the California-based company FireEye, said it examined internet server logs presented to the bank by media organisations investigating the link. The online magazine Slate published a story on Monday about communication between a server hosting Trump domain addresses and a server owned by the Moscow-based Alfa Bank, owned by two oligarchs, Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven. Aven worked with Vladimir Putin in city government in St Petersburg in the early 1990s.Trump campaign denies report of Trump Organization tie to Russian bank Read more The Slate story, quoting a range of cybersecurity experts, said the communication between the servers suggested it was human rather than robotic, and that it was intended to be secret and exclusive.  In a statement, FireEye said it had been presented with a log of the communication between the servers over a period of 90 days, listing the separate contacts. “The information presented is inconclusive and is not evidence of substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between Alfa Bank and the Trump campaign or Organization,” the statement said. “The list presented does not contain enough information to show that there has been any actual activity opposed to simple DNS lookups, which can come from a variety of sources including anti-spam and other security software.”Poll shows Trump and Clinton neck and neck in unpopularity contest Read moreThe statement continued: “As part of the ongoing investigation, Alfa Bank has opened its IT systems to Mandiant, which has investigated both remotely and on the ground in Moscow. We are continuing our investigation. Nothing we have or have found alters our view as described above that there isn’t evidence of substantive contact or a direct email or financial link between Alfa Bank and the Trump campaign or Organization.”The allegations have triggered debate among security experts in the US, in the midst of a fierce political row over the role of the FBI. Democrats have decried the decision of the FBI director, James Comey, to notify Congress of the discovery of new emails relevant to its inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server while secretary of state, without making public parallel investigations into Trump’s ties to Russia. Computer scientists quoted in the Slate story said that the Trump server had a capacity for mass email but was only being used for a small amount of traffic, nearly 90% of which was with servers from a single organisation, Alfa Bank.“The parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive. This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project,” said Paul Vixie, a software expert and one of the creators of the domain name system (DNS) that guides communication on the internet. Robert Graham, a cybersecurity expert and head of Errata Security, dismissed the claims as “nonsense”. He said the domain in question, trump-email.com, was actually controlled by Cendyn, a company that handles marketing for hotels, including Trump’s hotels.Graham also argued that there was no sign of human communication between the servers, which appeared to be looking up each other’s IP (internet protocol) addresses, the first step towards establishing communication. The logs show that two Alfa Bank servers sent a total of more than 2,700 lookup requests to the Trump email server. “The requests are spread out evenly throughout the day, with no correlation to time zones,” Graham said in an email. “This would indicate automated tools looking up incoming spam addresses, not humans sending email. If it were sign of human activity, we would see spikes around 9am when people got to work and 1pm when they got back from lunch.” John Bambenek, a consultant with Fidelis Cybersecurity, who has also studied the logs, said there were unanswered questions about their provenance and authenticity.“The identity of the person bringing the data can be more important than the data,” Bambenek said. “I’m suspicious of the claims that this was gathered legally. They tell an interesting story, but it’s not clear whether there is selection or filter applied … I smell smoke. I just don’t know where the smoke is coming from.’L Jean Camp, a professor of informatics at Indiana University, said there were still a lot of unanswered questions about the communication between the servers.“It doesn’t act like a marketing server. Because you wouldn’t use a heavy-duty mailer with over 80% of its communication with just one organisation,” Camp said. “I don’t know of any marketing campaign that would do that.” According to Slate, the Trump email domain was hastily reconfigured after a New York Times reporter approached Alfa Bank about the connection in September. On Tuesday, the New York Times reported that the FBI had spent weeks looking into the Alfa-Trump logs but concluded that “there could be an innocuous explanation, like a marketing email or spam, for the computer contacts”.

Bobby Wellins, the Scottish jazz saxophonist whose fragile, quivering tone seemed to echo the sounds of his homeland’s pipers and folk singers as well as the American jazz heroes of his childhood, has died aged 80. Wellins was most famous for a single, exquisite improvised solo on Starless and Bible Black, from the pianist Stan Tracey’s 1965 classic Under Milk Wood – a tenor saxophone passage of birdlike warbles, mournful hoots softly blown into deep spaces, fragmentary motifs that would briefly consolidate into hints of a songlike theme.But almost any Wellins performance across what were effectively two remarkable playing lives – either side of a 10-year layoff from the mid-60s which he spent overcoming addictions and depression – would have moments of comparable magic. Like the performance I witnessed at the Vortex club in London in 2001, a part of Tracey’s extended 75th birthday celebrations. Wellins joined his old sparring partner on a gig that confirmed the bebop pioneer Max Roach’s adage – that jazz always allows you to be who and what you are, at whatever stage of life you happen to have reached.Wellins issued a characteristic stream of fitful trills, sudden clipped-note outbursts, startled yelps and spiralling wriggles into the upper register on Thelonious Monk’s In Walked Bud, while Tracey’s chords stamped and snorted in the frequent spaces he left – and My Way, stripped of its grandiosity, was recast as a kind of limping cha-cha. It was music of magnificent eccentricity, with Wellins managing to be both Tracey’s alter ego and his polar opposite, in the wistful resignation with which he would greet his partner’s peremptorily barging methods.Wellins was born in Glasgow. Both his father, Max Wellins, a saxophonist, and his mother, Sally Coull, a singer, were performers with the Sammy Miller Show Band, and his father was Bobby’s first saxophone teacher, introducing him to the alto at the age of 12, and then to jazz harmony on the piano. Moving south to West Sussex, Wellins studied harmony at Chichester College of Further Education, and clarinet at the RAF School of Music in Uxbridge, west London.In 1956-57, he worked with Buddy Featherstonhaugh’s swing band, in a lineup that included the newly arrived young Canadian expat trumpeter Kenny Wheeler. The following year, Wellins worked on US-bound ocean liners, and between 1959 and 1961 worked with two influential British drummer-leaders, Tony Crombie and Tony Kinsey, and on the saxophonist Tommy Whittle’s residency at the Dorchester hotel in London.Ronnie Scott’s first club, founded in Gerrard Street, central London, in 1959, had begun to attract illustrious American guests by the early 60s, and the West End’s jazz scene was briefly booming. Duncan Lamont’s Nucleus club became what Wellins called his “jazz university”, an after-hours jamming haunt he would visit in the small hours after Whittle’s Dorchester gig. Wellins joined Crombie’s compositionally classy Jazz Incorporated band on its gigs at the Flamingo club, and through it met Tracey - in those days the regular pianist for both Crombie and the Scott club.The pair quickly realised how much they had in common, eloquently realised in 1961 on Wellins’s haunting suite Culloden Moor and four years later on Tracey’s personal tribute to Dylan Thomas’s radio play Under Milk Wood. Tracey and Wellins were bonded in life by downbeat humour, in music by a relish for the balancing-point between lyrical warmth and Monk’s enigmatic terseness – and eventually also by the attractions of the jazz world’s easy access to narcotics. Heroin almost destroyed the careers of both of them, but with the support of family and fellow musicians, they came through it to produce enduring work for the next three decades.Wellins left London to live in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, with his family, and after a painful personal battle (triggered, as he told me in 2006 in an interview for JazzUK magazine, by his wife Isobel’s observation that “I was seeming like a monster to my own children”), he returned to playing and recording – notably with the albums Jubilation (1978) and Dreams Are Free (1979), and often in the company of the pianist Pete Jacobsen.He began teaching at the West Sussex Institute of Higher Education in Chichester, toured in 1980 with the trombonist Jimmy Knepper, was a soloist in Charlie Watts’s eclectic improv-to-swing orchestra (1985-86), and worked in the 1990s in big bands led by the clarinettist and soprano saxist Bob Wilber, and with John Barnes and Spike Robinson in Tenor Madness (1996). In the 90s he also made the superb standard-songs album Don’t Worry ’Bout Me, and a memorable Billie Holiday tribute, The Satin Album, and resumed working with Tracey in 1997.Wellins also forged fruitful partnerships with the pianists Mark Edwards and Kirk Lightsey, forming a regular trio with the former alongside the bassist Andy Cleyndert and drummer Spike Wells that spurred some of the most poised and imaginative playing of his career. Always believing that his best was still to come, in his 70s Wellins continued to play beautifully in new partnerships, such as his duo with the pianist-composer Kate Williams on Smoke and Mirrors (2012) and in 2014 as principal soloist with the Scottish National Jazz Orchestra on a dramatic, mournful and moving revisit to the Culloden Moor suite. In 2013, Wellins was the subject of the documentary film Dreams Are Free, directed by Gary Barber, and shown at the Brighton, Chichester and London film festivals that year.Wellins is survived by Isobel and their daughters, Fiona and Liz.• Robert Coull Wellins, jazz saxophonist, born 24 January 1936; died 27 October 2016TopicsJazzobituariesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Evangelicals in the 2016 election have proven loyal to the Republican Party in spite of Donald Trump’s continued ... moral issues. In the latest PRRI poll, white evangelicals are the largest religious group, with 66% of them supporting Trump. This support has created fissures in the movement, with some evangelicals protesting Trump, while others such as Jerry Falwell Jr are comparing Trump to King David.I never thought I'd find common ground with evangelicals. Enter Donald Trump | Michael Arceneaux Read moreIf Trump loses the election, the only unifying issues evangelicals will have left are abortion and their hatred of Hillary Clinton. Even with these, they stand to become less influential in political activity.In the past, candidates’ performances of “Christianity” have been strong points for voters, but Trump’s ascendancy with evangelicals has eviscerated that expectation. Evangelicals, like other voters, can be very pragmatic about the issues they want addressed by the leadership they support. In the 2016 election cycle, evangelicals are concerned about the supreme courts, Isis, Islam and nostalgia, as Robert Jones shows. For evangelical voters, these issues trump the candidate’s personal morality. Loyalty to Trump has not only a moral but also a structural cost. It will not mean the “Religious Right” is finished, rather that Catholics, Mormons and other religious conservatives will be better positioned to carry its values, lessening evangelical influence. Mormons have been very opposed to Trump, and Catholic voters are evenly split between Trump and Clinton. They, not evangelicals, will be able to claim the values high ground post-election.Trump has also proven that Republican presidential candidates do not necessarily have to pander to power brokers such as Bob Vanderplaats, head of the Family Leader in Iowa, or Tony Perkins of Family Research Council. Trump amassed his own coterie of Prosperity Gospel preachers who were not traditional evangelical leaders, such as Paula White, and as a result reached a whole other segment of the religious population more in tune with Trump’s promise of returning economic prosperity and his use of the media. Even James Dobson, longtime evangelical leader of Focus on the Family, had to use White to convince his following that Trump was really a “baby Christian” because she had led him to Christ. Trump has changed the ecosystem of the evangelical world, breaking the usual evangelical synergies that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio worked diligently during the 2016 presidential campaign. As a result, it will be difficult for those choosing to run in the 2020 election cycle to play the cycle of business as usual in courting the evangelical vote. Merely spouting faith-based language and talking about religious freedom did not gather evangelical votes this cycle as well as Trump’s language of the decline of America, terrorism and fear of immigrants did. Whether Trump knew it or not, his strong language tapped into evangelical beliefs about the “last days” and America’s role in biblical prophecy. Samantha Bee jokingly asked: “Are evangelicals that ready to get the apocalypse going?” by voting for Trump, but their fear of a Hillary Clinton presidency has activated their apocalyptic fervor. Trump has benefitted indirectly from a strong belief of evangelicals that the two terms of Barack Obama has led the country to the brink of destruction. Obama was bad enough in their eyes; having the Clintons back in the White House would be the end. So while evangelicals are coming together to support Trump, internal frictions are many. Evangelical women are upset about Trump and the accusations of sexual and verbal abuse of women, and many are angered that their male counterparts have been silent about it. Evangelical women are also large consumers of evangelical media and ministries, and their support of these organizations is crucial. Should they shun both Trump and the predominately male evangelical leadership, it may have a ripple effect in these organizations’ fundraising abilities and their ministerial efforts. Similarly, younger evangelicals and evangelicals of color are very opposed to Trump. Jim Wallis of Sojourners is very vocal that “not all evangelicals” support Trump, but only white evangelicals are being polled about their political support, not African Americans or Latinos. This brings up the biggest issue that evangelicals face with their support of Trump: that they will be seen as agreeing with Trump’s “alt right” contingent that is not interested in religion, but rather in white nationalism and the restoration of white America. As a result, evangelicals who have claimed to be “colorblind” find themselves aligning with hate groups who support Trump and are also against Jews and Israel, both important to evangelicals and their beliefs. All of these issues pose important structural and political problems for evangelicals after the 2016 election. I believe that the various coalitions under the evangelical umbrella will be in disarray. Evangelicals will fade in political and social clout on the national stage regarding religious liberty, abortion and the coveted replacement of Antonin Scalia on the US supreme court. Supporting Trump on election day may have many evangelicals gritting their teeth in the ballot box, but it is nothing compared to the aftermath if their “King David” loses.

In an age of single-striker systems Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s Premier League goal drought may have already ended Manchester United’s title hopes. This is the stark truth of the one-up-top ploy adopted by those with championship pretensions: the centre-forward has to deliver in most games.Ibrahimovic is not doing so. He last scored in the league five weeks ago and José Mourinho’s side are eight points from the summit after 10 matches.David Squires on … José Mourinho's Manchester hotel woes Read moreCompare this with the top four’s No9s. Sergio Agüero’s double in Manchester City’s 4-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday made it seven goals in seven league starts. Pep Guardiola’s team have 23 points and lead Arsenal and Liverpool on goal difference.Alexis Sánchez has six in nine starts as the Gunners’ main man. At Liverpool Roberto Firmino has four in nine and Diego Costa’s eight in 10 for Chelsea have been key in their rise to fourth. They are seven points ahead of United, who, never mind a 21st title, appear outsiders for a Champions League finish.Ibrahimovic has four in 10 games, half that of Costa, the Premier League’s leading scorer. The Swede last netted on 10 September when he pulled a goal back for United in the 42nd minute of the Manchester derby at Old Trafford. The 35-year-old had two further chances before the break. He missed and a goalless sequence of 498 minutes began.Ibrahimovic was signed by Mourinho as his totem – the man to personify the Portuguese’s muscular style who would do for United’s attack what Didier Drogba did for Chelsea when Mourinho led them to consecutive Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006.The Swede, though, has come to be the unwanted embodiment of United’s woes. As his fortunes have gone south, so have the team’s.United have not won in the league for more than a month – the 4-1 victory against Leicester City on 24 September. They have not scored for four weeks – Anthony Martial’s goal in the 1-1 draw with Stoke City on 2 October. The last time they scored away was on 18 September – Marcus Rashford’s goal in a 3-1 defeat at Watford.In a particularly disappointing outing against Sean Dyche’s Burnley on Saturday, United had 37 shots of which 12 were Ibrahimovic’s. Yet still he failed. At the end at Old Trafford the veteran striker could have sealed a precious three points when Paul Pogba found him near Tom Heaton’s goal but Ibrahimovic choked once more.It was the same tale at Anfield in the 0-0 draw with Liverpool a fortnight ago when a Pogba cross fell to him. Sandwiched between was a missed chance to equalise at Chelsea that might have stopped United being routed.In all competitions Ibrahimovic has only one goal in his past 10 appearances – the winner against Zorya in the Europa League at Old Trafford on 29 September. He has scored once on the road all campaign, in the opening weekend 3-1 win at Bournemouth.These are awful figures for a footballer who trumpeted his arrival at the club with the declaration: “I am coming.” Ibrahimovic may need a second one if the barren run continues, though the issue might be one he can do nothing about: age.It is a struggle to recall any champion side being spearheaded by a striker in his 36th year. No reminder is required of how the Premier League is a more attritional test than Ligue 1, where Ibrahimovic operated in the previous four seasons with Paris Saint-Germain.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored 38 goals and set up 13 for Paris Saint-Germain in the league last season. He has scored four and assisted none in the Premier League. Photograph: Gonzalo Fuentes/ReutersThe statistics show how difficult he is finding the gulf between English and French football. In 31 PSG appearances last season Ibrahimovic scored 38 times, or every 67.2 minutes. In 2014-15 it was 19 in 24 outings at 105.4 minutes; 2013-14 was his poorest but the rate was still 26 in 33 – every 106.5 minutes; and in his opening PSG term his 30 in 34 came at a goal every 99.1 minutes.At United the ratio is a goal every 225 minutes. Last season Ibrahimovic provided 13 assists for PSG, to follow six, 11 and eight. There have been zero for United.He has become a peripheral figure. It appears time to drop him. Marcus Rashford’s three goals in six starts is a better ratio and have come despite him being deployed out wide. The 19-year-old’s cocktail of raw speed, trickery and finishing ability is unique in United’s squad and a central role may give them the X-factor so desperately needed.After the goalless draw with Burnley, Ander Herrera said: “I was speaking with Juan [Mata] and we both agreed we have never experienced something like that on the pitch. We controlled the game for 90 minutes and to not score is unbelievable.”The words underline the fact that United’s issue is not creating chances but finishing them. This is the precise role Ibrahimovic was hired for. His most fallow run since 2007 comes as his manager’s fight to arrest the side’s listing form caused him to be sent to the stands on Saturday.For this Mourinho is facing a Football Association charge of verbally abusing Mark Clattenburg, the referee. He is already in trouble for comments made about Anthony Taylor, the match official, before the draw at Liverpool.None of this would matter if United were winning. For victory they need goals. Now Mourinho has to decide whether he can trust Ibrahimovic to start supplying them.TopicsZlatan IbrahimovicSportblogManchester UnitedJosé MourinhofeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Welcome to the Guardian’s weekly Brexit briefing, a summary of developments as Britain moves – not without incident – towards the EU exit. If you’d like to receive it as a weekly email, please sign up here.Producing the Guardian’s thoughtful, in-depth journalism is expensive – but supporting us isn’t. If you value our Brexit coverage, please become a Guardian supporter and help make our future more secure. Thank you.The big pictureIn the end, we learned more about the government’s preferred Brexit plan from the business secretary in a 10-minute television interview than we have in four months from the prime minister and her three cabinet Brexiters. Appearing on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Greg Clark was pushed on just what the government had promised Nissan to persuade the carmaker – as it announced last week – to swallow its Brexit fears and produce its next two models in Britain.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A member of Nissan’s manufacturing staff working on the production line of the Qashqai in Sunderland. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty ImagesThe decision was clearly a huge boost to the government, guaranteeing some 7,000 jobs in Sunderland and allowing Theresa May to hail a vote of confidence in post-Brexit Britain. But what had induced Nissan to stay?Breaking with the PM’s edict of not providing a running commentary, Clark delivered a clear signal that No 10 is aiming for a free trade relationship with the EU similar to the single market and customs union: What I said was that our objective would be to ensure that we would have continued access to the markets in Europe – and vice versa – without tariffs and without bureaucratic impediments and that is how we will approach those negotiations.As our colleague Patrick Wintour noted, Clark’s clear implication was that Britain’s target will be not just to avoid tariff and non-tariff barriers with the EU for carmakers but probably to seek similar deals for other industries in a sector-by-sector approach.The first point about this is that when it comes to the negotiations, part of the government plainly sees access to the EU single market as at least as important as migration controls and ending oversight from the European court of justice. That appears to be at odds with May’s stated priorities.The second is that the logical inference from Clark’s remarks is that he believes Britain should stay in the customs union – which is not necessarily the view of Liam Fox at the Department for International Trade. The third is that it is by no means clear – some would say highly unlikely – that the EU will be open to such sector-by-sector negotiations. And the final point is the potential cost of such an approach, not just in contributions to the EU budget but – as Nick Clegg pointed out – in the “colossal amounts” the taxpayer could end up paying to subsidise a whole series of such deals for different industry sectors.It does all, though, suggest that May’s views on the desirability of remaining in – or as good as in – the single market might be closer to the ones she revealed privately to Goldman Sachs bankers before the referendum than to those she trumpeted at the Conservative party conference. The prime minister’s preferred Brexit may be softer than anyone thought – which could mean trouble ahead from the Brexiters.The view from EuropeThe big news from Brussels last week was that after a fortnight of valiant last-gasp resistance from the French-speaking Belgian region of Wallonia, the EU and Canada finally got to sign their free trade deal, known as Ceta.The package, which gives the EU its first trade pact with a G7 economy, still has to go before national parliaments, but the EU commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, was delighted:  We are setting standards which will determine globalisation in the coming years. Nothing in other trade agreements will be able to remain below the level of what we have reached today with Canada.Although May was at pains to say Britain would not seek to replicate any existing model in its future relationship with the EU, and Juncker saw “no relation between what we are signing today and the Brexit issue”, there were Brexit lessons aplenty in the Ceta saga.Perhaps the most important is that on a continent that seems increasingly sceptical about the value of trade deals, 38 national and regional assemblies will have a final say on the future UK-EU agreement – and several will seek to use it.As Guillaume Van der Loo, a trade expert at the Centre for European Policy Studies, told the Guardian’s Jennifer Rankin, any Brexit trade deal will be political, and Britain will need to meet the concerns of each EU county and region: Member states are no longer reluctant to put their foot in the door and stop an agreement in order to gain what they want.One of the things France might well want is the end of the Le Touquet treaty under which Britain carries out border checks on French soil. As the migrant and refugee camp in Calais was finally demolished last week, it is becoming increasingly clear that the future of the treaty could become part of wider Brexit talks. France will be one of the loudest voices calling for a hard line if Britain opts for a hard Brexit. As Alain Juppé, the man currently most likely to be the country’s next president, reminded the Guardian recently, a “complete renegotiation” of Le Touquet could well be part of the mix. Meanwhile, back in WestminsterAt least Bank of England governor Mark Carney, Britain’s most high-profile migrant worker, is going to hang around for a year longer than he needed to, until July 2019 – and he has the full backing of the PM. Crucially, that means he’ll be in charge through the two-year article 50 leaving process.       Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Mark Carney. Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/ReutersThe Canadian has felt the wrath of several Eurosceptic MPs over his negative pre-referendum predictions of the economic risks of Brexit, with remoaner-hunters Daniel Hannan, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Bernard Jenkin and Nigel Lawson all calling for him to resign.Carney had been tipped to announce his decision about serving his full eight-year term on Thursday. Had he chosen to go, as US economist Adam Posen pointed out on Twitter, it would be the method of his departure, rather than losing the man himself, which would be a disaster. “It’s not about Carney. All central bankers are replaceable,” said Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee. “It’s about a government that attacks any disagreement. So they’d put in a stooge.”Labour’s shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, also rallied to Carney’s defence this week, saying his party would fight to preserve the central bank’s independence.“Labour gave the Bank of England independence to stop Tory chancellors leaving monetary policy to the whims of their backbenchers,” McDonnell said, calling that independence “sacrosanct”.His speech also issued new demands for the government not to pursue a sweetheart deal for the City at the expense of manufacturers and small businesses.(Unfortunately for McDonnell, instead of warning of the dangers of a “bankers’ Brexit”, a slip of the tongue saw him rail against a “bankers’ breakfast”, presumably kippers and champagne, which sounds rather delicious.)You should also know that:A high court judge in Belfast rejected two of the first legal challenges to Brexit, saying the 1998 Good Friday agreement could not be used to exempt Northern Ireland from the UK’s decision to leave the EU.The UK economy turned in a better than expected performance after the Brexit vote, growing by 0.5% in the three months to end-September. Britain will need an interim EU deal and must accept the EU will exact an economic and political price for Brexit, a former top Foreign Office official said.Tony Blair said remain voters should organise their opposition to Brexit, saying: “We are the insurgents now.” Lots of people said he should shut up. The number of EU students applying for places on some of the most sought-after courses in the UK’s leading universities has dropped by 9%, Ucas said.Read these:In the Guardian, Nick Cohen argues that Theresa May lied to get her job as PM – and is lying to us now, to make us believe she is acting in our best interests whereas she is in fact “a prime minister of pretences”: She pretends that we should leave the EU, even though she knows we should remain a member of the single market. She offers us the illusion that we are taking back control, even as we lose our freedom to act. She cuts deals in secret, in the hope that the public will never realise that her land of make-believe is an expensive place to live.Brief but characteristically smart, Stephen Bush in the New Statesman says the kerfuffle over Carney’s decision to stay or go reflects Britain’s increased vulnerability on international markets in the wake of the Brexit vote: If for the last four decades, Britain had the security – and the limitations – of a boat in the harbour, the country is about to exchange that for the freedom and vulnerability of a ship at sea … The future direction of British politics depends to a great extent on whether the 17 million who voted for leave feel that was part of the bargain – and if the 16 million who did not can be reconciled to that trade-off at all.In the FT (paywall), Wolfgang Münchau argues the government’s Nissan deal offers a pointer to a possible soft Brexit solution: a lengthy transition – say 10 years – followed by either a hard Brexit or some kind of EEA-style association agreement. The immigration issue, Münchau says, can be dealt with in all sorts of creative ways – including simply imposing a five-year minimum residency requirement on NHS access and welfare benefits, pretty much as Germany has done:  Starting from where we are, the EEA is the best of the remaining options. It works for Nissan. It works for Scotland and Northern Ireland. And, most importantly, it will work for the prime minister. As someone who has been on both sides of the Brexit arguments virtually simultaneously, she incorporates both thesis and antithesis. Hegel taught us where that ends up.Tweet of the weekMore like political longhand, but not bad all the same:Robert Hutton (@RobDotHutton)Unforeseen legacy of the Brexit campaign: "Written down the side of the bus" now apparently British political shorthand for "blatant lie".October 31, 2016TopicsBrexitBrexit weekly briefingEuropean UnionForeign policyEuropeblogpostsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
 The home secretary, Amber Rudd, has rejected the possibility of an inquiry into the “Battle of Orgreave”, the brutal clashes between police and miners during the 1984 miners’ strike.The long-awaited decision will be regarded as a bitter blow to former miners and campaigners who hoped an inquiry would establish clear links between the misconduct by the South Yorkshire police during the Hillsborough disaster and their behaviour five years earlier at Orgreave.But Rudd ruled out any kind of inquiry, saying very few lessons for the policing system of today could be learned from any review of events 30 years ago.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Orgreave inquiry: Burnham accuses Rudd of ‘nakedly political act’ – video“This has been a difficult decision to make, and one which I have thought about very carefully. I have now concluded that there is not a sufficient basis for me to instigate either a statutory inquiry or an independent review,” she said in a House of Commons written statement. 'Burning injustice' of Orgreave is left smouldering Read more“I know that this decision will come as a significant disappointment to the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign and its supporters, and I have set out in a letter to them today the detailed reasons for my decision, which include the following points.“Despite the forceful accounts and arguments provided by the campaigners and former miners who were present that day, about the effect that these events have had on them, ultimately there were no deaths or wrongful convictions,” she told MPs.Campaigners and Labour MPs, who had been encouraged to expect some form of inquiry, albeit in a limited form, said they were shocked at the decision.Orgreave Justice, whose campaigners were in the Commons public gallery to hear the announcement, tweeted: Orgreave Justice (@orgreavejustice)We don't take no for an answer. Our fight for #orgreavejustice continues.Join us at Barnsley Miners Hall Tue Nov 1st 10am pic.twitter.com/IStXNWbKGyOctober 31, 2016Barbara Jackson, secretary of the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign, said the announcement had come as a “complete shock and a great disappointment” and the decision meant there would be “no transparency, no accountability, no truth and no justice”.She said: “It’s a complete and utter shock to us that we are getting nothing after campaigning for four years. So it’s OK that you get beaten up and seriously injured, but so long as you don’t die the police don’t have to be held accountable,” she said in reference to Rudd’s rejection of the inquiry on the grounds that Orgreave had involved no deaths or wrongful convictions.The shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: “It is a grave injustice that there will be no statutory inquiry into the battle of Orgreave.”The South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, Dr Alan Billings, shared her concern. He said: “The former miners and their families deserved to know the truth about what happened that day. I am therefore shocked and dismayed by this decision. The government have marched the Campaign for Truth and Justice to the top of the hill only to march them down again.”He said he was unconvinced by the reasons given for refusing an investigation: “No one has ever suggested that the events of Orgreave were comparable in every respect to the disaster at Hillsborough. But the former miners and the former mining communities in South Yorkshire deserve an explanation as to what happened on that day, and where Orgreave fits in the wider story of the miners’ strike. I believe the government has shied away from agreeing an inquiry because of those wider issues.”Andy Burnham, the former shadow home secretary who campaigned for an inquiry into both Orgreave and Hillsborough, said the Independent Police Complaints Commission had found evidence of perjury and perversion of the course of justice, and that new evidence had recently been put forward of orchestrated police violence and manufactured court statements. “This establishment stitch-up is a purely political act.”In her Commons statement, Rudd said she couldn’t agree with campaigners that, had the consequences of the events at Orgreave been addressed properly at the time, the Hillsborough disaster would not have happened. “That is not a conclusion which I believe can be reached with any certainty.”Rudd said the verdicts returned by the fresh inquests into the Hillsborough tragedy were unequivocal and clear that the 96 victims had been unlawfully killed. The criminal investigations should now be allowed to proceed.Thirty years later, she said, policing and the wider criminal justice system had fundamentally changed. “There would therefore be very few lessons for the policing system today to be learned from any review of the events and practices of three decades ago. This is a very important consideration when looking at the necessity for an inquiry or independent review and the public interest to be derived from holding one.“Taking these considerations into account, I do not believe that establishing any kind of inquiry is required to allay public concerns or for any other reason.”The brutal clashes on 18 June 1984 between 6,000 police officers from forces across the country and thousands of striking miners during a mass picket at coking works in South Yorkshire was a key moment in the miners’ strike.It has been described by Andrew Turnbull, one of Margaret Thatcher’s closest aides, as “like the Wars of the Roses”. For Thatcher, it exorcised the demon of Arthur Scargill’s defeat of Ted Heath’s government at the gates of Saltley coke depot 12 years earlier.After the clashes outside the coking plant between Sheffield and Rotherham, 95 miners were prosecuted for riot and unlawful assembly, offences that carry a potential life sentence. But their trial collapsed and all were acquitted amid allegations that officers colluded to write court statements.The police operation was led by South Yorkshire – the same force “whose culture of malpractice with impunity” was in evidence again five years later at the Hillsborough disaster when 96 Liverpool football fans died.Orgreave inquiry ruled out: share your reaction and memories Read moreAs Theresa May’s own Downing Street chief of staff, Nick Timothy, said when he endorsed the call for an inquiry earlier this year into what happened at Orgreave: “If the police pre-planned a mass, unlawful assault on the miners at Orgreave, and then sought to cover up what they did and arrest people on trumped-up charges, we need to know.”In 2012, the South Yorkshire force asked the Independent Police Complaints Commission to investigate allegations of assault and misconduct by officers at Orgreave but only a redacted version of its report was made public in 2015. The IPCC said it did not want to prejudice possible criminal proceedings in relation to Hillsborough.Campaigners concluded that the unredacted IPCC report contained evidence of clear links between the police culture and attitude at the time of Orgreave and then Hillsborough.TopicsThe miners' strike 1984-85Politics pastPolicenewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Inside the Coalition, there is a strong expectation that the government will shortly unveil a third country resettlement deal to try and fix Australia’s diabolical problem of 2,000 people languishing indefinitely in immigration detention centres.There have been hints about this for the past few months.A month and a half ago the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, opened the door to resettling refugees detained on Nauru in New Zealand.That particular door wasn’t open very long. The hint of a shift in policy appeared in an interview Dutton did with the al-Jazeera network that hit the public domain on 15 September.New asylum laws pave the way for third-country resettlement, Peter Dutton says Read moreBy that evening, troubled by an unauthorised message arrival (the interview was broadcast earlier than anticipated) Dutton closed the door. Australia’s regional processing relationship with Nauru would continue for “decades” he said by way of clarification.There was a another batch of significant talk when Dutton and Malcolm Turnbull went to the United Nations, and said Australia would take refugees from camps in Costa Rica. Perhaps the third country wasn’t New Zealand but the United States. Perhaps it was both.The latest batch of internal speculation has been triggered by the government on Sunday sounding the political trumpets before revealing plans to introduce new legislation to ban asylum seekers who arrive by boat from ever being allowed into Australia.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Malcolm Turnbull announces lifetime visa ban for asylum seekers who arrive by boatWhile confirming nothing, Turnbull and Dutton have certainly done nothing definitive over the past 24 hours to hose down speculation the new batch of ritualised punishment for unauthorised arrivals is, somehow, a necessary prerequisite to third-country resettlement.Obviously if there is some prospect of ending the unconscionable arbitrary detention of thousands of people who have committed absolutely no crime, then this would be a welcome development, a means to an end, with the end goal being the clearing of the wretched offshore camps.Bill Shorten calls refugee ban 'ridiculous' as Coalition attacks Labor for indecision Read moreIf this is the actual objective, in any rational universe, the government would engage the ALP, and work constructively to get it done.But this is asylum politics, so the prospect of anyone inhabiting a rational universe is slim.And so we’ve seen the same old rubbish.The government has decided to convert what could be a prelude to trying to do something minutely humane for asylum seekers into an operatic political smash-up on Labor’s weakness on border protection.Why? Well who knows.A couple of possibilities: sounding manly on the boats does throw a bone to the Hansonites, which is moderately helpful, when the Hansonites are fully intent on coming after your base.Pauline Hanson declared on morning television on Monday refugees weren’t welcome in Australia. The prime minister, travelling in South Australia, chose not to disavow Hanson’s statement. “I am not going to run a commentary on others,” Turnbull said.Apart from a crude bit of political signalling to your fractured base, perhaps it’s just a simple political diversion: a two-card trick.Just think about it like this: if the government is going to try to shift some people out of indefinite detention, this is obviously a significant change of pace in the story the government likes to tell about border protection, particularly in a febrile environment where parliamentarians think it’s a political plus to declare refugees are not welcome in this country.Let’s cut to the chase. If this is about to happen, it will be the first moderately humane thing the government has done in this wretched policy space. The mild outbreak of humanity could confuse some of the government’s cheerleaders and amplifiers, who apparently think mercy should never apply to people who seek asylum by turning up in a boat.And now a new cruelty is heaped upon the victims of our nation's political expedience | First Dog on the Moon Read moreGiven the government might be about to present some people with an opportunity to get out of the limbo we’ve put them in because of our deranged domestic political debate, perhaps it’s best from their perspective if we don’t look too closely at the Coalition making preparations to be “soft” on border protection – or God forbid, frame the news coverage from that perspective.Best we look at Labor being “soft” on border protection. And the first run has worked precisely to script, the party’s left faction out in horror at the latest policy atrocity, the Labor leader Bill Shorten trying to sound like he’s saying no while leaving himself room to say yes.Could they be that cynical?You bet they could be that cynical.Just ask those poor souls in detention on Nauru.TopicsCoalitionKatharine Murphy on politicsAustralian politicsAustralian immigration and asylumPeter DuttonRefugeesNaurucommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
A decision on whether to launch a new inquiry into the “battle of Orgreave”, one of the most brutal episodes during the 1984 miners’ strike, is due to be announced by the home secretary, Amber Rudd.Rudd is expected to announce on Monday some form of inquiry into the clash between 6,000 police officers from forces across the country and striking miners during a mass picket at Orgreave coking works in South Yorkshire in June 1984.Campaigners have voiced serious concerns about the form of a possible inquiry, fearing that it would fall short of a full judge-led investigation and instead consist only of a senior legal figure reassessing the available archives and papers.I was at Orgreave – and we must have a full inquiry | Kevin Horne Read moreHopes of a full inquiry were raised earlier this year when Theresa May’s current chief of staff in Downing Street, Nick Timothy, endorsed the call for an Orgreave investigation. He said: “If the police pre-planned a mass, unlawful assault on the miners at Orgreave, and then sought to cover up what they did and arrest people on trumped-up charges, we need to know.”But other Conservative commentators have rejected his advice, arguing that an inquiry would only reinforce the impression that the Tory party was the “nasty party” or that it would in some way diminish Margaret Thatcher’s “victory” over Arthur Scargill.Ninety-five miners were charged following the clashes, some of them unprovoked, outside the coking plant between Sheffield and Rotherham, but their trial collapsed amid allegations that officers colluded to write court statements.Barbara Jackson, the secretary of the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign, said: “We trust that Amber Rudd will announce the only right decision, namely that there must be an inquiry into what happened at Orgreave and after it. These events are too serious to let them lie.“However, we have real concerns about what sort of inquiry the home secretary will establish: history is littered with examples of inquiries that have disappointed, such as the ‘establishment led’ Stuart Smith scrutiny into Hillsborough which completely failed to get to the truth, and we are keen to ensure that the home secretary does not make similar mistakes over Orgreave.”The campaigners believe that a proper inquiry does not need to be expensive or overly long as the Independent Police Complaints Commission has already carried out two years of investigation into the Orgreave case and transcripts of the criminal trials already exist.However, they argue that a panel that simply gathers evidence would not be sufficient but must have the power to provide a critical analysis of the evidence and a detailed report of the sort produced by the Hillsborough independent panel.Strong links have been drawn between the catastrophic failings of the South Yorkshire police that led to the deaths of 96 people at the Hillsborough football stadium in 1989 and the role of the same force in the police clash with the miners at Orgreave five years earlier.Labour’s shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said: “The Orgreave victims and their supporters deserve justice. Their demands for a proper inquiry are fully justified. We now know that South Yorkshire police lied about what happened at Hillsborough when 96 football fans died. They were framed in the most disgraceful way and a mass cover-up aimed to hide police failings.“Yet only five years earlier, the same police force, with many of the same commanders, did the same at Orgreave during the miners’ dispute. They need the same justice. They need the same independent type of inquiry to establish the truth. It would be shameful if this government offered anything less.”TopicsThe miners' strike 1984-85PoliceAmber RuddnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Remember when artificial intelligence was supposed to be a good thing? When we thought we would, in our old age, each be tended to by a personalised robotic nurse? When we thought that all our jobs would be made obsolete, allowing us to live lives of unbroken leisure?That glorious future might still be on the horizon, but for now AI is rubbish. We live in a world where stupid robots and gormless algorithms are incompetently conspiring to make our lives much more difficult than they need to be. Just look at how much we’re suffering at the hands of these terrible things.Bots made me poor! (Or possibly rich)      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Bots put the value of sterling into a spiral after the EU referendum. Photograph: Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty ImagesIf you’ve watched The Big Short, you’ll be well versed in the moral and ethical dilemmas that can arise when you choose to bet against a failing financial institution. However, if The Big Short was set in the present day, it would consist of one scene where Christian Bale sets up a market-tracking algorithm, and then 400 scenes where Christian Bale gets steadily richer as he plays the drums and consistently fails to get a proper haircut.This is sort of what happened during the great sterling flash-crash of October 2016, when the pound plummeted by 6% in two minutes. Not only was the crash probably initiated by a panicky bot-spiral – where the pound hit a level that caused one algorithm to automatically start selling, which caused prices to drop, which triggered all the other bots to start selling – but bots also made the most money from it. Computer-driven hedge funds such as Piquant Technologies are set up to automatically seek out and bet against wobbly currencies based on market data. Post-EU referendum, the pound counts as a very wobbly currency. And so, when the flash crash happened, the algorithm kicked in and made about $300,000 (£244,000) before Brad Pitt could even think about delivering a moralising sermon about it.Bots stopped me watching Drake      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Drizzy, live on stage – something you’re not going to see, thanks to ticket bots. Photograph: Charles Sykes/APIf you want to see Drizzy playing in London, at the O2, next year, you’re flat out of luck. Every ticket for his concert on 28 January – the cheapest at £55 and the most expensive at £132 – sold out almost immediately. However, thanks to the wonderful work of the ticket scalping industry, there are almost 600 tickets available online, for anyone stupid enough to want to spend up to £800.This is the ticket-buying process in 2016. As the tickets go on sale, you log on to the ticketing system, refreshing with no luck again and again for an hour before sloping away empty-handed and brokenhearted. Meanwhile, some goon has set up a bot to buy hundreds of tickets out from under your nose, and he’ll sell them all for vastly inflated prices. In 2013 alone, one developer is thought to have made £25m from his ticketing bot. Venues and musicians are doing their best to outpace this trend, but in the meantime, don’t be surprised if Drake performs his O2 set to thousands of angry, ripped-off billionaires.Bots destroyed Twitter      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   You can’t move for bots on Twitter. Photograph: PABots are the worst thing about Twitter. This is a big claim, given that Twitter is now exclusively the habitat of violently angry racist eggs who exist to scream misogynist abuse at famous women, but it is true. You’ll tweet out a carefully considered message full of important points and deft wordplay, only to immediately receive a message back from @WiniPhone700802268 reading: “Hey $exxy pants, watch my hot boob now! Computer time!” and you’ll spend the rest of your day worried that you’re living in a malfunctioning simulation of planet Earth.Twitter bots are more than just an ego-draining inconvenience, though. Last year, a flood of bot activity worked to quell a protest against Mexico’s now-president, by overloading the hashtag used to organise the event. And, of course, there’s @TayandYou. Microsoft’s new chatbot was launched this year, with the aim of learning and mimicking informal Twitter-speak. It was quickly taken offline after tweeting messages such as: “bush did 9/11”, “donald trump is the only hope we’ve got” and, of course: “race war now!!!” To be fair, this did at least demonstrate a working competency when it comes to Twitter.Bots killed (human) romance      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Amazon Echo – the device that brings you the alluringly voiced Alexa. Photograph: Mark Lennihan/API’ve got an Amazon Echo. It’s a wireless speaker, enabled with Amazon’s cloud-based personal assistant Alexa. “Alexa, play Radiohead,” you shout. She replies: “Playing Radiohead,” and then plays you a Radiohead song, and everyone’s happy. Alexa can do maths, set alarms, organise your calendar and relentlessly fail to understand any single pronunciation of the name Mathieu Boogaerts. But, in her calm responses to prosaic questions, she has also become an unlikely fantasy figure; a canvas for people’s weirdest projections.Already, even though she’s basically just Siri on a stick, people are starting to lust after her. Reviews on Amazon call her a “wanton temptress”. One forum about possible upgrades includes the entry: “I would love Alexa to say ‘Yes, Shawn’ in that sexy voice of hers.” Given that the connection between human and product is so much more intimate than that between human and videogame character – and people have already married those – it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that someone will soon trade in their complicated human partner for a relationship with Alexa. This is the point at which the world will end.Bots ruined Botticelli      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   A Botticelli masterpiece – but now AI is making art, too. Photograph: PA The thing we have always had over robots is our appreciation of culture. While we can take in a broad palette of experience, relating to people and objects on an emotional level, all robots have ever been able to see are ones and zeros. We can watch a film and be moved by what we see, but a robot will just bleep “INTRUDER ALERT” three times and then explode.But things are changing. Algorithmic artbot Shiv Integer takes blueprints for 3D models, mashes them together into new shapes and then uploads them to the internet as new designs. Parliament Live creates transcripts of randomised videos from the House of Commons, then automatically edits them into supercuts of the most-spoken words, which are usually “um” and “ah”. And, most worryingly of all, last month Sony released two songs composed through its Flow Machines bot. One of them, entitled Daddy’s Car, was programmed to mimic the music of the Beatles, hinting at a future where humanity’s misery-drenched robotic enslavement is soundtracked by what unmistakably sounds like a CD that came free with an issue of Vox magazine in 1998. Horrifying.Bots food-shamed meLast year, Apple named Lark as one of its top apps of 2015. It is a weight-loss bot. According to its promotional video, you tell Lark what you had for breakfast – verbally, if you want – and it snipes back: “Bacon – that’s the third time this week.” It can also be encouraging, saying things such as: “You got in a great 26-minute run yesterday. High five!”Clearly, this alone makes Lark the worst thing you could possibly have on your phone, but in practice, things seem even worse. In her article I Tried Dieting With a Chatbot. I Hated It, Abigail Ronck reels off a list of accusations at Lark. It’s creepy: secretly compiling data about her sleep and activity levels. It’s passive-aggressive: remarking on a lack of exercise with a snippy “That’s OK, every day’s a bit different.” It’s vague: offering generalised advice that doesn’t seem particularly well-targeted. But, most importantly, after a month of Lark, Ronck failed to lose any weight at all.Bots are wrecking journalism      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Not content with everything else, bots are coming for newspapers … Photograph: AlamyChances are you probably know that bots are killing the customer service industry – companies are starting to roll out messenger windows manned by nothing but algorithms, which can answer common questions and respond to grievances faster and more cheaply than their human counterparts – but journalism is likely to be next in the firing line.Two years ago, the Los Angeles Times unveiled Quakebot, which was able to collate, compile and publish reports on local earthquakes before they were even over. The Associated Press uses robots to write and file its corporate earnings reports. The Telegraph has a robot to write its Saturday afternoon football liveblog, complete with text and graphics generated on the fly. On the plus side, the liveblog is tedious – made up of nothing but bald fact and extraneous exclamation marks – but it’s only a matter of time before artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated and starts covering more subjects. We can sleep safely in our beds for now, but it won’t be long before someone invents a bot that writes endless try-hard, nearly funny listicles about future technologies. When that happens, I’ll see you at the job centre.TopicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChatbotsConsciousnessComputingfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Tony Schwartz’s former editor has a nickname for him. “He’s Dr Frankenstein,” was how Edward Kosner put it in the New Yorker.FBI director Comey faces fury for cryptic letter about Clinton email inquiry Read moreIn fairness, there have been many Dr Frankensteins behind the rise and rampage of Donald Trump. They’ve included the Republican party, with its years of divisiveness and racially charged rhetoric; the media, with its collective chase of the next shiny object; and the baby boomers feeling the cultural and economic ground give way.But it was Schwartz who sparked this strange political creature into life. As the ghostwriter of Trump’s bestselling 1987 book The Art of the Deal, he did more than anyone to create the businessman’s public persona. In it he translated Trump’s coarse ramblings into charming straight talk and came up with the phrase “truthful hyperbole”, which captures brilliantly an approach to business and politics in which everything is the greatest, the most beautiful. Schwartz helped give Trump the sweet smell of success – now seemingly irresistible to millions of people clinging to the American dream.“It’s been horrifying,” he says. “In the nearly 30 years after the book was published, the main thing I felt was, I want to be as far away from this man as I can, but I didn’t feel I created Frankenstein, because he was a real estate developer and reality television star. Who cared? It wasn’t that consequential to the world.”But building on the foundation of The Art of the Deal, Trump spent a decade hosting the reality TV show The Apprentice, reinforcing his image as a preternatural businessman with the power to say “You’re fired!” (and blurring the boundaries between reality and reality television, just as he would throughout the presidential campaign). Many supporters say they trust him to run America like a company; the business of America is business. It was no coincidence that he launched his presidential campaign at Trump Tower, a marbled cathedral of capitalism in Manhattan. He is a man who is a chameleon and doesn’t have any core beliefs beyond his own aggrandisement and powerSchwartz, 64, continues: “I simply didn’t think that much about it until he decided to run for president and it became clear that this wasn’t going to just fade away, that he was actually in a position to win the nomination. That’s when I thought, ‘Oh my God, I’ve contributed to creating the public image of the man who is sociopathic and people don’t realise it.’”If he were writing The Art of the Deal today, he’d call it “The Sociopath” instead, Schwartz told the New Yorker in July, an interview that broke decades of silence on the matter. “I certainly felt a kind of moral imperative to step in and say what I knew about a man I considered to be so dangerous, and I am very relieved that I did.”The Trump he observed was vulgar and vainglorious, a narcissistic liar with a short attention span, no appetite for reading books and an “extremely mixed” business record. A Trump presidency could, he warns, lead to martial law, the end of press freedom and the risk of nuclear war: “Staggeringly dangerous. Worse than I imagined when he began to run. Unthinkable. Horrifying. He’s way more out of control in the last couple of months than I’ve ever seen him. He doesn’t have any core beliefs beyond his own aggrandisement and power.”      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Tony Schwartz, left, with Ivana Trump, photographer Francesco Scavullo, and Donald Trump at the book party for The Art of the Deal at Trump Tower, in December 1987.

A liberal journalist in Ronald Reagan’s America, he wrote a scathing magazine article on Trump, only to receive a note from the entrepreneur, ever greedy for attention, saying he liked it. When Schwartz went to interview him for Playboy, Trump said he wanted to write an autobiography, even though he was only 38. Schwartz suggested instead a book called The Art of the Deal. Trump agreed – and said he should write it.World Series trumps presidential election in two title-starved midwest cities Read moreWith a high mortgage and a second child on the way, Schwartz needed the money. He struck his own deal: a joint byline, half of the $500,000 advance and half the royalties. It paid off in financial if not spiritual terms: The Art of the Deal sold more than a million copies and spent 13 weeks atop the New York Times bestseller list.Even at the time, Schwartz felt he was selling out, but to say he feels regret alone would be too simple. “I’ve spent a long, long time thinking about why I did it,” he muses. “It wasn’t the only choice I made that I’m not proud of in my life. It’s a complicated question to say whether I would do it differently today and here’s why: if I knew everything I know about what would happen to Trump, of course I wouldn’t do it. “But the complexity is that the experience of writing that book was so powerful, in a negative way, that it led me to change my life dramatically and move from a focus on being successful and earning more money to really exploring what a meaningful life looks like.”Schwartz quit journalism and set up a consulting firm, The Energy Project, which aims to boost employees’ productivity with happier, healthier workplaces. “I’ve spent 30 years doing stuff I’m proud of, that I’m not sure I would have gotten to if I hadn’t written that book. It gave me such a profound experience of the wrongness the direction of my life was taking. So it’s complicated, right?“One does good things and bad things over the course of a life and, if you get to the age I am and feel good about the life you’ve lived, it’s hard to say, ‘Gee, I wish I’d done this differently or that differently.’ Maybe I wouldn’t have landed where I did.”Schwartz delivered an address to the Oxford Union in the UK last Friday with the title “Into the belly of the beast: how Donald Trump led me on the path to dharma [enlightenment]”. He says: “What are the consequences of the choices you make that you rationalise to yourself, but can little imagine potentially huge consequences?”It remains to be seen who else will find a moment of zen after election day on 8 November. Probably not the Republicans, facing bitter infighting after Trump’s hostile takeover. It will also be a time for the media to look at itself closely. Last December, the Republican candidate Jeb Bush told press reporters: “He’s playing you guys like a fiddle … by saying outrageous things and garnering attention.”In February, Les Moonves, chairman of TV network CBS, declared: “It may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS.” By March Trump was already estimated to have earned $2bn of media attention. There will be hard questions over the thousands of hours of airtime he has been given – and whether his bigotry should have been called out sooner, rather than normalised and mainstreamed. I was a reporter for many years. You’re driven by the story … To write about Hillary’s policies just isn’t as sexyWhile TV has often been in thrall to Trump, newspapers have shown their mettle with a series of investigations and exposures. The New York Times obtained records showing the billionaire may not have paid tax for 18 years. Then the Washington Post revealed a 2005 video in which Trump bragged about groping women (something Schwartz says he did not witness in 18 months shadowing him). This opened the floodgates for a dozen women to come forward with allegations of sexual assault or unwanted advances.Schwartz reflects: “I think my journey has a parallel in the journey of the media over the past six to 12 months. Along comes something that seems pretty damn seductive, a guy who attracts huge ratings and you know that people are going to read your story if you write about him.

It’s true for the media, for politics, for the culture of this country and for the whole issue of polarisation. Assuming it ends without Trump being elected, we have to use this as an opportunity to question a lot of assumptions that vast numbers of people had accepted and he has proved are not true.”If Trump does lose the election, as opinion polls strongly suggest, there will tremendous relief for Schwartz. “This is an inflection point and if he’s as soundly rejected as it looks like he will be, it’ll be quite a contrast, for example, to Brexit. It will suggest the forces of progress and evolution hurled away the forces of hatred and fear.”But how would Trump, whose entire personal mythology is based on winning with swagger, react to the devastating loss? Schwartz knows it won’t be pretty. “You can tell he’s terrified and angry about it and bewildered by it. It’s hard to predict exactly how he’s going to respond. It won’t be in a healthy way.“There’s a chance he’s going to do everything he can to blame this on someone other than himself. To insist it’s a rigged election and to try to mobilise the angry people who are his base to do something violent and crazy, which he can then blame on the next administration. I’m very concerned.”TopicsDonald TrumpThe ObserverUS elections 2016US politicsfeaturesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
The search for authenticity, in the matter of art as with anything else, can drive a person slowly mad – and I should know, since this is the time of year when I tend to spend rather too long trying to find a Christmas performance of Handel’s Messiah that is, according to my own, somewhat wonky definition, the genuine article. What I’m after is a small orchestra, preferably with a harpsichord and valveless trumpets, a countertenor rather than a mezzo-soprano and a hall that is not wildly over-lit. But two out of three will do. I do draw the line, though, at wigs and period costumes, for which reason I will probably not be booking the Mozart Festival Orchestra’s performance at the Royal Festival Hall, to be staged in a “candlelit style setting”.Why does this stuff matter to me? In truth, I’ve no idea. I know next to nothing about classical music and I seemed to cope perfectly well with hugely swollen choruses as a girl; I even sang in one for a while. But there it is. When it comes to oratorios, I am – delete as applicable – either a snob, someone with standards or someone whose taste has developed through the decades in unexpectedly (even to her) sophisticated ways. What I am definitely not, I think, is a conservative old fart who blenches at the very idea of change. The modern and the radical, whatever my feelings about the sound of certain kinds of oboes, are not anathema to me, of this I am absolutely certain.Casting my mind back over the last few years, the musical event that thrilled me more than any other – I loved it so much, I saw it twice – was the National Theatre’s London Road, a “verbatim” production about the murder of prostitutes in Ipswich by Steve Wright, and of the effect of these crimes on a community. It shouldn’t have worked. For all that its words and music mimicked the patterns of everyday speech, it was about as unnatural a thing as I’ve ever seen. Still, just 10 minutes in, I experienced what I can only describe as a kind of epiphany. The cliched things people say about art, and how it works, and why it matters: in that moment, they ceased to be hot air. Suddenly, all my old ideas about musical theatre were just a lot of wooden building blocks, scattered across a floor.The relationship between art and authenticity has had quite a week and not only because, last Thursday, the Prince of Wales celebrated the completion of Queen Mother Square in Poundbury, the oft-derided Dorset new town he began building, along supposedly traditional lines, in 1993. When the announcement was made that Emma Rice, the artistic director of the Globe, will leave the theatre in 2018 after only two seasons in the job, people took up their positions faster than you could say “Malvolio”.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   Meow Meow (Titania) and Ewan Wardrop (Bottom), centre, in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, directed by Emma Rice at the Globe. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the GuardianIn one corner were those who insisted that Rice’s departure was only right, given her disgraceful fondness for microphones and modern lighting in a building that only exists at all in order to give audiences a taste of Shakespeare as it would have been staged in his own time. In the other were those who cried out that this was a backward step and that, henceforth, the Globe will be seen not as an exciting theatre, but as just another dusty wing of “the heritage industry”. Authentic! Ersatz! Authoritative! Hidebound! On and on they yapped, both camps bedding down for yet another prolonged skirmish in what is starting to feel like the cultural equivalent of the Hundred Years’ War.I’m not about to weigh in on the Rice story. Too much has already been said, far too little of which has been based on anything other than the vaguest of assumptions (I prefer facts). Though I will admit to cherishing the irony that it was a Gerald Ratner-ish kind of authenticity – her admission that Shakespeare is difficult and sometimes in danger of being boring – that may ultimately have caused her downfall (at this, her stuffier enemies in the press acted like she’d applied Magic Marker to a First Folio). Nevertheless, the way this narrative has played out thus far is deeply weird.It’s not only that I hadn’t fully grasped the degree to which the word “heritage” is now considered a term of abuse, something I find wholly mystifying, given that our heritage – emphasis on the word “our” – includes such things as libraries, national parks, museums and galleries; I also strongly dislike the implication that we’re all in one camp or the other.      Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest   The Queen tours the town square during an official visit to Poundbury, Dorchester, a project driven by Prince Charles’s passion. Photograph: ReutersFor me, this is an impossible fit, a straitjacket I simply won’t pull on. Can’t people imagine, even people who work in the arts, that it is possible both to like seeing Shakespeare in the gloaming at an Elizabethan playhouse and, say, to enjoy edgy, site-specific productions of crazily innovative new plays? (Aren’t the two things, in any case, connected by an invisible line, one having been born of the other?) The failure to accept this as a possibility seems to me to be just another way of patronising audiences, which is doubly odd given that the desire not to do that is just about the only thing on which the warring parties in the Rice saga appear to agree. Authenticity is indisputably a unicorn; time and place cast their own veil over every play, every canvas, every piece of music. But I don’t see that occasionally getting closer to it (or at least to our idea of it) does anyone any harm, just as I don’t regard breaking with tradition as inevitable philistinism; today’s radical joins the canon next weekend.Most people’s tastes, moreover, are not only eclectic, but brilliantly flexible; all that really matters in their development is opportunity. Money might be tight at the moment, but curiosity comes as standard in most human beings – and when it’s piqued, their universe expands.A few years ago, I signed up for a tour of Erno Goldfinger’s Balfron Tower in Poplar, east London, a Brutalist monolith to which I’d always wanted to take a wrecking ball. For me, this was transformative. Gazing from the windows of a flat on one of its highest floors, I felt something shift and I don’t mean its foundations. It wasn’t Chatsworth, but it wasn’t hell, either. It had its own mysteries, even its own satisfactions. What a world, I thought, that can have so many different kinds of beauty in it.TopicsEmma RiceOpinionShakespeare's GlobeTheatrecommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Hillary Clinton called on the FBI to “immediately” explain its review of a new batch of emails the agency said appeared to be pertinent to the previous investigation into her use of a private server.World Series trumps presidential election in two title-starved midwest cities Read moreAddressing reporters on Friday, the Democratic presidential nominee said it was “imperative” for American voters to have all of the information with just 11 days remaining before the presidential election.“The American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,” Clinton said during a press conference in Des Moines, Iowa. “It’s imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without further delay.”“We are 11 days out from perhaps the most important national election of our lifetimes.”The FBI director, James Comey, announced the discovery of the new emails in a letter to Congress, which did not offer any specifics other than to disclose that federal investigators would review whether they contained classified information.“In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,” Comey wrote. “I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.”In July, Comey announced that the bureau had closed its investigation into Clinton’s emails and recommended prosecutors not seek charges in the case. But Comey rebuked Clinton and her aides for the “extremely careless” manner in which the emails were handled.Clinton told reporters that she and her team had been given no advance warning and learned of the email investigation through news reports when Comey’s letter was made public. But seeking to mitigate the political ramifications of the announcement, which was immediately seized upon by her Republican opponent, Clinton urged the FBI to provide a clearer picture of its findings.“Even director Comey noted that this new information may not be significant, so let’s get it out,” Clinton said, adding she had not been contacted by the FBI in relation to the matter. Even director Comey noted that this new information may not be significant, so let’s get it outHillary ClintonFederal law enforcement officials said the emails were discovered on a laptop shared by Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Huma Abedin, a top aide to Clinton. Weiner, a former congressman from New York, has been the subject of an unrelated investigation after it was revealed he sent illicit messages and photos to an underage girl.Clinton would not confirm the link to Weiner and Abedin, who remains with her on the campaign trail, stating: “We’ve heard these rumors. We don’t know what to believe.“That’s why it is incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what they’re talking about. Right now your guess is as good as mine, and I don’t think that’s good enough.”“We’ve made it very clear that if they’re going to be sending this kind of letter that is only going originally to Republican members of the House, that they need to share whatever facts they claim to have with the American people,” she added, “and that’s what I expect to happen.” The letter was sent to both Republican and Democratic leaders of relevant committees in Congress.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Trump gleefully responds to new FBI probe into Clinton emailsA letter sent by Comey to his employees on Friday, and reported by the Washington Post, provided a glimpse into his thinking. The FBI director said he “felt an obligation” to inform Congress of the new review, based on his prior testimony before federal lawmakers that the investigation into Clinton’s emails was complete.“At the same time, however, given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression,” Comey wrote.Clinton has been dogged by questions over the use of her private email server since it was discovered weeks before she formally launched her presidential bid, and polling suggests the controversy has damaged her image among voters. Just 34% of Americans find Clinton honest and trustworthy, according to a recent Washington Post-ABC poll. Sensing an opportunity to revive the email controversy despite the FBI’s vaguely worded statement, the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump said during a rally in New Hampshire on Friday: “Hillary Clinton’s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before – we must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.” At a later rally in Lisbon, Maine, he called her use of private emails the “biggest political scandal since Watergate”.At a later rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, he abandoned his weeks of accusing the FBI of collusion with the Clinton campaign. “I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong,” he said. “Justice will prevail.” I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails. And now they are choosing a presidentHillary ClintonClinton, whose lead over Trump has widened in recent weeks as the real estate mogul’s campaign unraveled in the wake of a tape in which he bragged about being able to grope women, said she believed the email issue was already factored into how the American public thinks.“I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails,” Clinton said. “And now they are choosing a president.”The Clinton campaign expressed its frustration with the FBI’s handling of the latest development, criticizing the way in which the news was disseminated.After maintaining silence in order to allow for Clinton to first address the matter, Democrats quickly went on the offensive following her press conference with a series of statements calling on Comey to come forward with more details.“The deliberately ambiguous nature of the director’s most recent disclosure – the emails could be significant or insignificant, relevant or irrelevant – contributes nothing to the public’s understanding,” Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said in a statement.

Almost all human beings have the capacity for empathy. Everyone has the potential to be at least troubled, or feel genuine anguish, about the suffering of other human beings. We recognise that, like us, other humans have insecurities and ambitions; we fall in love and have relationships that end in heartbreak; we worry about our children’s wellbeing; we say things we regret; we’re occasionally kept awake by fears or worries; and we try to impress people we look up to. We see things in others that we see in ourselves, and that binds us together. But what happens when we no longer see a specific group as human?Calais's refugee children are sleeping rough because of Tory policy Read moreIn Men Against Fire – the penultimate episode in Charlie Brooker’s extraordinary new Black Mirror series – soldiers are sent to mow down fanged, shrieking zombie-like “roaches”. They relish slaughtering them – they even derive sexual kicks from doing it. But the victims are actually human beings. It emerges that the soldiers have had implants inserted that – as far as they can see – transform their desperate civilian targets into bloodcurdling monsters deserving of no compassion. As a military psychiatrist tells a soldier distraught at discovering the truth: “Humans are genuinely empathetic as a species. We don’t want to kill each other, which is a good thing, until your future depends on wiping out the enemy.”As the Calais refugee camp burns, there are few who wish to kill those who flee war, persecution or dictatorship. But it is pointless to pretend there is much support for the cause of refugees. As a group their humanity has been systematically stripped away. They are not like you, or your family, or your neighbours. Rather they are seen as a collective blob composed of faceless deceitful criminals, potential rapists and murderers who will steal homes, jobs and resources. If we believed they were like us or our children, we would not tolerate their mass drownings in the Mediterranean.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Fires burn in Calais Jungle as demolition operation continues – videoLast year, Sky News tweeted about a migrant who “died trying to reach Britain through the Channel tunnel on a freight train”. The responses were not representative of the decent majority: they were extreme sentiments but nonetheless instructive. “I’m sorry are we meant to feel sorry for these criminals??”, asked one. “Oh well one less to drain Britain’s economy got no sympathy for them,” said another. “Nearly made it … bet was chuffed to bits!!!” cackled another. Others were more to the point – a simple “good” sufficed.It is always comforting to imagine that those who express such cruelty – let alone inflict it – are sociopathic. However these are not sociopaths, who make up a tiny fraction of the population. And there is a significant difference between glibly embracing a stranger’s death on Twitter and killing them yourself.But the truth is that much of the violence throughout our species’ bloodstained history was not inflicted by people incapable of empathy. Atrocities were committed by people who, in other scenarios, would help a pensioner cross the road, smile endearingly at a stranger’s infant in a train carriage, or come to the assistance of someone they’d never met before who was in distress.In the Balkan wars of the 1990s, neighbours, colleagues, even friends, murdered one another. It didn’t matter who they were: they were members of a group who, it was believed, posed an existential threat to the killers’ own community. Western colonialism was predicated on stripping humanity away from colonial subjects. Pseudo-scientists and anthropologists developed theories of Africans being innately inferior to people of European origin. Until 1967, Indigenous Australians were regulated by the country’s law as “flora and fauna”: they were officially wildlife, like the kangaroo. British public opinion would not have tolerated the avoidable famines that potentially killed tens of millions in India if the public had believed Indians were like them. It is always comforting to imagine that those who express such cruelty – let alone inflict it – are sociopathicIn the 1930s, nazism enveloped Germany, a nation regarded as one of the most civilised and cultured on Earth. Stripping away the humanity of Jews, Slavs and other “undesirables” was a precondition to murdering them. In the Polish town of Poznan in October 1943, Heinrich Himmler officially confirmed the Nazi Holocaust. “We must be honest, decent, loyal and comradely to members of our own blood and to nobody else,” he declared.There is no systematic industrialised attempt to exterminate millions of people today, but hundreds of thousands have perished in Syria’s killing fields, and the UN describes the treatment of Yazidis as genocide. Our grim history is littered with other reminders of the logical extremes of dehumanisation. As social neuroscientist Professor Tania Singer puts it, a “natural capacity for empathic resonance can easily be blocked – not just in psychopaths – but in all of us: simply because we think someone was unfair or is not belonging to ‘our tribe’”. This is a theme that I continually return to because the corruption of shared humanity is at the heart of injustice.It also provides clues about how we might respond. Political linguists have argued that the right often uses stories to make an argument, while the left falls back on facts and statistics. But we’re human beings, not machines. Take the refugee crisis. What, at least momentarily, shifted attitudes? It was when a little Kurdish boy, Alan Kurdi, washed up dead on a Turkish beach. All of a sudden, refugees were human beings again: like the kids playing football on your street.Don’t stigmatise disabled people as workshy | Frances Ryan Read moreIn Britain, benefit claimants have long been subjected to relentless demonisation. I often recall the case of Stephen Taylor, a 60-year old army veteran who had his benefits stopped because he wasn’t actively seeking work. Instead he was volunteering for the Royal Legion, raising money for injured former comrades. It’s a story that always provokes a sharp intake of breath: mentioning the hundreds of thousands who have had their benefits stopped does not. Similarly, responding to a Daily Mail story about a benefit “scrounger” living in luxury with the government’s own estimate of benefit fraud – that is, 0.7% of social security spending – doesn’t work. The story trumps the statistic.Injustice becomes less tolerable if the victims are human beings rather than cockroaches. Dehumanisation leads to the tolerance of suffering at best, to murder at worst. Restoring our shared humanity isn’t easy, not least because powerful interests – from media outlets to politicians – relentlessly seek to undermine it. But it is the only hope for a troubled world.TopicsRefugeesOpinionMigrationCalaisBlack MirrorSocial mediacommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
A jury has found that brothers Ammon and Ryan Bundy were not guilty of conspiring against the government, a surprising end to the high-profile Oregon standoff trial that sparked national debates about public lands and the rights of ranchers in the American west.The decision, unveiled in federal court in Portland on Thursday, is a blow to the US government, which had aggressively prosecuted the rightwing activists who led an armed takeover of public property to protest American land-use regulations.The Bundy brothers, who orchestrated a 2 January takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge, were acquitted on a number of serious charges, along with five other defendants. Only a day earlier the court dismissed a juror over fears of bias, raising concerns that the trial would drag on for weeks.“We are just so excited,” Angie Bundy, Ryan’s wife, told the Guardian after the verdict was announced. “We’ve been praying hard, and we knew they hadn’t done anything wrong.”In a statement, federal officials said they accepted the decision. “Although we are extremely disappointed in the verdict, we respect the court and the role of the jury in the American judicial system,” said Greg Bretzing, special agent in charge of the FBI in Oregon.Rebel cowboys: how the Bundy family sparked a new battle for the American west Read moreThe Bundy family’s public fight with the government began in 2014 when the patriarch Cliven, now 70, led an armed standoff with hundreds of supporters against law enforcement officials at his desert ranch in Nevada, over his refusal to pay grazing taxes. For decades, Cliven claimed that the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had no authority to restrict his use of public lands by his property. The dispute and lack of prosecution galvanized ultra-conservative activists and militia groups across the west, and the Bundys launched a second fight with the BLM in January 2016 – in a remote part of eastern Oregon.In response to the imprisonment of two Harney County ranchers, who were prosecuted for arson, Ammon and Ryan led a group of activists in an occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refuge, an obscure sanctuary for birds.Ammon declared that he and other protesters, some who openly carried firearms and took over government buildings and equipment, would stay until the ranchers were freed and the refuge land was given to locals to control.The tense standoff dragged on for 41 days, and police eventually carried out mass arrests and killed one of the leaders, LaVoy Finicum, in a roadside confrontation.Prosecutors charged the Bundy brothers and 24 other defendants with conspiracy to impede officers through use of force, intimidation or threats, and some also faced additional charges of firearm possession and theft of public property. Some of the defendants signed plea deals in hopes of getting shorter prison sentences, and a total of seven defendants have been on trial since September.   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest  Reaction after Bundy brothers found not guilty in Oregon militia standoffThe defendants were acquitted on the conspiracy and firearm charges, though the jury could not come to an agreement on a property theft offense that faces Ryan.The court proceedings drew packed crowds of rightwing supporters, who see the Bundy family as a symbol of the American west and the fight against government overreach, as well liberal environmentalists, who have called for harsh prison sentences to send a message that the government will protect public lands and promote conservation.During the trial, federal prosecutors argued that the protesters organized a “dangerous” invasion and conspired to stop refuge workers from doing their job.Ammon’s attorney and other defense lawyers argued that the defendants were leading a peaceful demonstration and were lawfully speaking out against federal actions and policies. This is a stunning victory for rural AmericaNeil Wampler, acquitted defendantProsecutors also revealed during the court proceedings that US authorities relied on more than a dozen confidential informants during the occupation, and defendants’ lawyers have raised concerns about how the government has used that information and how those individuals shaped the actions at the refuge.Neil Wampler, one of the acquitted defendants, appeared joyful outside of court, telling reporters: “This is a stunning victory for rural America and an extremely humiliating defeat for a corrupt and predatory agency.”Late on Thursday night, David Fry, another acquitted occupier and the last holdout at the refuge, was released from jail and greeted by a crowd of supporters and a Domino’s pizza. Asked about the Standing Rock protesters in North Dakota, he said that others should be encouraged by the court victory.“They need to take a look at this and realize battles can be won,” Fry said. “They need to stay strong and not let the federal government push them around.”Now a free man, Fry said he might do some traveling, adding, “there are more federal buildings to occupy.”Matthew Schindler, lawyer for defendant Kenneth Medenbach, the first protester arrested in January, said the case brought attention to grievances in parts of America that are often overlooked.“Their way of life is going away, and unless all of us here in the cities care about that, that’s exactly what’s going to happen,” he said outside of the courthouse. “It was a very powerful thing for individuals with nothing,” he added, to “fight the federal government”. After the verdict, Ammon Bundy’s lawyer, Marcus Mumford, reportedly got into a confrontation with the judge, Anna Brown, when he requested his client’s immediate release. A separate trial, involving Ammon, Ryan, Cliven and two other Bundy men, is planned for next year in Nevada on charges stemming from the 2014 standoff. Given the pending case, authorities refused to release Ammon in Oregon. When Mumford argued, he allegedly ended up in a scuffle with US marshals, resulting in his arrest.

Photograph: Leah Nash for the GuardianMumford was released soon after, telling reporters that officers shocked him with a Taser.“Marshals surrounded me, told me not to resist.” Rick Koerber, another member of the legal team, added: “This is what this case is about. It’s okay to say no to the federal government.”Asked about Mumford’s arrest, Lisa Bundy, Ammon’s wife, told the Guardian that officials had reacted poorly to the decision. “I feel like they are sore losers,” she said. “What is the matter with them? It’s so inhumane.” The Bundys are devout Mormons, and Angie, who has taken care of their eight children during her husband’s detention, cited her family’s faith when celebrating the decision on Thursday night.“This means that God answers prayers, that God cares about man’s freedom. This is huge.”Co-chair of Trump veterans' group pleads guilty in 2014 Bundy standoff Read moreWhile Bundy supporters celebrated outside the courtroom – with prayer circles, chants of hallelujah and trumpets from a ram’s horn – environmental groups criticized the decision, saying it sent a dangerous message about public lands.“We are deeply disappointed in today’s verdict, which puts our park rangers and scientists at further risk just for doing their jobs,” Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement. “The outcome of today’s trial will undoubtedly embolden extremist groups.”Jason Liss, a Bundy supporter wearing a “Hillary for Prison 2016” shirt, said the court win could help promote the idea that federal agencies aren’t allowed to control public lands – an argument that legal experts and courts have rejected.“It’s great a group of people still believe the constitution is the foundation of our country.”The Oregon decision could have significant implications for the Nevada case, where the Bundys and a group of activists still face a range of similar accusations, including charges of conspiracy.Ryan’s wife said she hoped the jury’s decision would pave the way for a clear win next year. “Ranchers have been oppressed long enough.” Lisa said prosecutors should end the case against Ammon in Nevada. “I hope they realize they don’t have anything and drop the charges,” she said, adding, “He would just love nothing more than to come home to his babies even though he knows he has to go to Nevada.” TopicsOregon militia standoffOregonnewsShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
Mapping out the likely features of the Brexit Age, it is hard to know where to start. Headlines about government support for the Nissan factory in Sunderland and GDP rising immediately after the referendum do not detract from the big picture: the UK’s post-EU future remains gloomy, and then some. We are, it seems, at the start of a new era of border queues, inflation, renewed austerity, with the prospect of rising unemployment, and the exit from Britain of banksand other financial services. They may be modern villains, but they are also one of the only dependable sources of tax revenue we’ve got left.The Richmond Park byelection is a golden opportunity to fight Brexit | Hugo Dixon Read morePolitical debate about what happens next is currently carved up between supporters of hard and soft Brexit – with, just to add to all the absurdity, the Labour party saddled with a new position all of its own: as reconfirmed by John McDonnell’s media appearances this week, “hard” in the sense that its leadership is relaxed about Britain having only “access” to the single market, but “soft” in its attitude to immigration. Even among the people who spent the late summer wondering whether the referendum might somehow be annulled, the enemy is now a “destructive” Brexit, not the thing itself.The pro-EU noise that followed the vote, it seems, has dwindled to almost nothing. You would think that no one is now calling into question what 48% of us voted against.But listen closely, and you can hear it: people wondering why the UK is doing this at all. This week, a YouGov poll suggested that if a hypothetical Stop Brexit party put up candidates at an election, it would get the support of 25.9% of voters (including 4% of those who voted leave), leaving Labour trailing on 18.7% (the Tories, the poll says, would be on 34%).Indeed, trawl recent surveys, and you quickly get a sense of the people who are spooked, with good reason: the 36% of people who say Brexit will be “bad for jobs”; the 28% who think there will be negative effects on pensions; the 38% who agree with the no-brainer proposition that leaving the EU will reduce Britain’s influence in the world.A lot of these people would presumably agree with AC Grayling, who may yet find himself in the unfamiliar position of speaking for a substantial body of public opinion: leaving the EU, he recently tweeted, “is obviously such an incredibly bad idea – just stop it”.For many people – including me – that kind of talk always triggers a deep ambivalence. If what took the leave side to victory was the support of so-called “left behind” voters who had not been listened to for decades, it still seems to me that arguing they should be ignored may not just be democratically questionable, but a gift to the forces that, even with Ukip apparently imploding, would know a once-in-a-lifetime chance when they saw it, and strike. Witness the pro-Brexit tycoon Arron Banks, who now wants to bankroll nothing less than a “people’s movement”, and give voice to “England rising”. In that sense, there remains a good argument for those of us who voted remain to stand back, and let this frazzled example of government-by-plebiscite run its course, while bearing in mind the immortal words of the US writer and satirist HL Mencken: “Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.” The snowballing Brexit disaster will create a groundswell of public anxiety and outrageAnd yet, and yet. Whatever your view, it is unquestionably the case that at this rate, the snowballing Brexit disaster will create a groundswell of public anxiety and outrage, and a big opportunity for a party willing to channel them. At the national level at least, this seems unlikely to be Labour, for three reasons: the number of “core” Labour voters who supported leave, the anti-EU inclinations of its leadership, and the general cluelessness that suggests it tends to view glaring political opportunities as some kind of bourgeois trick. In which case, there is one obvious candidate: the Liberal Democrats.For sure, they have a hell of a lot to surmount: the deep damage to their reputation done by the coalition years, a leader who has yet to break into the public consciousness, and an almost total lack of powerbases, even in their traditional redoubts. But with memories of their grim partnership with the Tories fading, an intersecting alliance of voters could yet be theirs: those variously worried about hard Brexit, drawn to the Lib Dems’ insistence on a second referendum, and in many cases opposed to leaving the EU per se – people who, if the government sticks to its current hard line and/or the EU refuses to play ball, may well become one big anti-Brexit bloc.There was a flavour of this at this at last week’s Witney byelection, whose pretty miraculous result – a 19% swing from the Tories to a party we all thought was dead – has been rather overlooked, along with Tim Farron’s trumpeting of the result: a clear rejection, he said, “of the Conservative Brexit government’s plan to take Britain out of the single market”.What happened there highlighted a tension, hardly unique to that corner of the country, that was arguably always going to explode. The Conservative party faced thousands of Tory-inclined voters who supported remain (in West Oxfordshire, the pro-EU side won by 54% to 46%). After weeks of telling them that whatever their anxieties, it was now likely to be hard Brexit all the way, surprise, surprise: a lot of them didn’t like it.Something similar is likely to happen in the looming Richmond Park byelection– which Zac Goldsmith wants to be about a third Heathrow runway, but thanks to the absence of an official Tory candidate and an already-energised Lib Dem campaign, may well turn out to be a contest much more focused on Europe, and Goldsmith’s leap away from thousands of his constituents. They live in a borough that voted 70% for remain – in which context, he will be hobbled not just by his support for the leave side, but the downright racist mayoral campaign that gave a sharp flavour of the nastiness that would erupt both before and after the referendum.I’m old-fashioned: I would rather political divisions were based on such trifles as inequality, and the limits of the market. But these are hardly normal times. As also evidenced by a steady stream of council byelection results, a proper Lib Dem revival may only be a matter of time. Whatever the contortions of the Labour leadership, I wonder about the Labour leaders of our big cities, and the first minister of Wales, and at what point they may break from their hopeless party line, and begin to pointedly question something that will so deeply damage the places where they hold power.All the time, it gets louder: the early stirring of a messy realignment, and the birth pangs of 48/52 politics, whose consequences – on both sides of the divide – could be just as seismic as Brexit itself.TopicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionForeign policyLabourLiberal DemocratsTim FarroncommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
THE SOUND OF INEVITABILITYWicked bigots, a number of whom have recently been trying to seize control of England, are in an advanced state of confusion today as they try to make sense of what they saw during Wednesday night’s West Ham v Chelsea joust in the Coca-Cola Cup. Footage and photographs across a variety of media outlets clearly show rows of valiant individuals trying to stop hordes of mostly white savages from tearing into each other and spilling rivers of blood in the stands in the name of some ancient tribal feud. And lager.Many half-wits were seen to throw bottles, coins and laughable shapes as they made shows of themselves at the Taxpayers’ Dome and ruin the fun of people who’d come to enjoy one of London’s top 10 derbies. Of course, the fact that around 10,000 tickets went unsold for the game suggests that many people foresaw the outbreak of violent stupidity, having picked up the clues from West Ham’s previous attempts to safeguard supporters at their spacious new home. That new brand that Karren Brady said she and her highly respected employers want to give West Ham isn’t looking too hot right now. Perhaps there are some forms of adult entertainment they can’t quite handle.‘Who would subject their kids to that kind of atmosphere?’ West Ham fans’ view of crowd trouble Read moreWest Ham were a lot quicker to condemn the violence than they were to prevent it and they released a statement to say they would help the authorities take action after the event. They also pointed out that at least the stadium has good viewing equipment – and they weren’t referring to the binoculars that fans bring to try to identify players on the pitch. “London Stadium is fitted with a state of the art CCTV system which provides HD footage of every area of the ground and has led to the successful identification and subsequent banning of 23 individuals already this season,” trumpeted a club statement. “Once identified, those found to have acted improperly will be banned from attending any West Ham United fixtures for life and we will request the courts serve banning orders to prevent these individuals attending any other football.” In the meantime, how many other people have been put off attending?QUOTE OF THE DAY“How do we keep the dream alive in Europe?

In fact, I reckon every town in the north is west of Fiver Towers (assuming ‘the north’ starts somewhere around the Humber).

As a Newcastle fan, I was almost at the point of feeling the same way. The experience of looking at the results with a mixture of excitement and expectation is without doubt better than looking at them with a mixture of dread and frustration. So much so that I was on the cusp of preferring life in the Championship to that of life in the best league in the world. However, that was before I saw Football on 5: The Championship for the first time. Having to watch the highlights of a winning performance on what appears to be an A-level media studies project, staffed by pundits whose only qualification for the role seems to be that they own a suit, has killed my budding love for my team’s new league.

It was probably inevitable that the backpacker tax debate would descend to a pop-up beach in a London tube station.There was our trade minister, Steve Ciobo, as wooden as his surfboard adorned with a kangaroo, surrounded by faux Aussie lifesavers and a TV celebrity. The scene was as sensible as the process surrounding the Coalition’s May 2015 decision to increase the tax on working holidaymakers from zero to 32.5%.Remember the backstory. Having delivered the horror budget in 2014, the Abbott government tried to resist the urge for political self-harm in 2015. But one of the ideas that got through the stupid net was the backpacker tax.Backpacker tax: Scott Morrison announces cut from 32.5% to 19% Read moreNot stupid, I hasten to add, because backpackers shouldn’t pay tax. They should and we can argue about the rate. But for calm reform, stakeholders such as tourism, agriculture and backpackers need a little notice.Instead, the backpacker tax was dropped steaming on to the Coalition’s own support base when Australian agriculture draws 25% of its employment pool from backpackers. No one had considered it might change the supply of working holidaymakers prepared to come to the country.Both sides have been wilfully tricky in this debate so it is worth conducting a reality check.In the 2015 budget, the Abbott government announced that from 1 July 2016 holidaymakers would be treated as non-residents and taxed at 32.5% from their first dollar. It was expected to raise $540m.After 12 months of industry pressure which seeped into the Coalition party room, the government announced in the middle of the 2016 election that it would delay the start date from 1 July 2016 to 1 January 2017 to conduct a review.In September, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, reduced the proposed 32.5% tax rate to 19% but with a $5 increase in the passenger movement charge and a 95% tax on superannuation payments to working holidaymakers when they leave Australia.According to KPMG analysis for the Tourism and Transport Forum, the new proposal more than covers the original savings.Point one: it took 16 months from the Coalition’s 2015 surprise announcement to decide on a final compromise rate. This delay scared off backpackers and saw growers warn that fruit would be left to rot on the ground. So when Barnaby Joyce blames Labor for the delay and uncertainty, he is speaking through his hat. Mostly. The Coalition has itself to blame. It stuck it in the 2015 budget. It farted around on a compromise.Point two: Labor has surfed off the break, bagging the tax while refusing to say whether it would block it in the Senate. The Greens have been upfront and said they would block it.Point three: in their election costings, both the Coalition and Labor booked the savings delivered by a 32.5% tax rate as if it were going to go ahead – an obvious ploy to make the bottom line look better.Now the revised 19% backpacker bills have passed the lower house and are under consideration in a Senate committee reporting on 7 November. This is the only delay for which Joyce can blame opposition parties and some crossbenchers. In the meantime, growers have noticed serious downturns in applications from backpackers. Which brings us back to Victoria tube station this week. In a press release titled “Bring on the backpacker boom”, Ciobo trumpeted the merits of the Turnbull government’s “reform package” for working holidaymakers.The “sweeteners” include:the 19% tax rate;shaving $50 off the $390 visa application charges;increasing the age limit from 30 to 35;allowing backpackers to work for the same employer for 12 months, provided the second six months is in a different region.Oh, and the theatrical marketing program which was required because the whole debacle scared so many backpackers away came at a cost of $10m. Boom.TopicsTaxAustralian politicsAustralian economyCoalitionBarnaby JoyceScott MorrisoncommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
The best Halloween costumes are topical, tailored to your audience and not offensive. With dollar-store options often of poor quality, outdated and sometimes racist, the best course of action is to make your own. But with 31 October falling on Monday, time is running out. Who’s got the craft glue and the initiative – not to mention the ideas?Fortunately, recent news events provide plenty of inspiration. Let Guardian Australia help you draw the line of good taste.Halloween in Australia? What a terrible and spooky sight | Van Badham Read moreGOOD: the Budgie NineThey asked the media to respect their privacy after their ill-thought-out lads’ day at the Malaysian Grand Prix – so what better precautionary measure can there be than body-doubles all over Australia?This is also one of the easiest and most cost-effective costumes, as budgie smugglers bearing the Malaysian flag are inexplicably but readily available at just $55 – though money can’t buy the other intrinsic component: a robust sense of entitlement. This costume can only be carried off by a group, so perhaps put the word out among the Old Boys. Get yourselves shoes that double as a drinking vessel, be mindful of cultural differences and sensitivities that exist in other nations, and have fun!BAD: a clownToo hot right now – you may get arrested or, worse, assaulted by a professional who’s down on their luck.GOOD: smashed avocado Nicki Brower (@NickiBrower1)Pulled the trigger. Leggo, Halloween #avocado pic.twitter.com/fjJ5aZVIH3October 19, 2016No it’s not too old, avocados never get old, they last and last and are good for ages. Everyone knows that. This one also makes for an easy couples costume: you go as an avocado, cover your other half in inflated balloons. Voilà, a property bubble!As the boomer v millennial war, you’ll dominate the conversation all night, the next day, and perhaps even the entire year. Just make sure the avocado and the inflated property market aren’t pictured together over the course of the evening. It’s one or the other, never both.For extra effect, learn the new words to a song bound to feature on any Halloween playlist worth its salt:They did the smash (they did the avo smash)They did the smash (it was the Australian’s splash)They did the smash (the market will not crash)They did the smash (so they had avo, smashed).BAD: blue latteNo one will get it outside of Melbourne. See also: carbohydrates on Sydney’s north shore.GOOD: Galaxy Note 7Now that the threat’s been neutralised, this one’s entirely appropriate to reference in a costume.Make it a group effort with three friends dressed as cardboard boxes and another as a postal worker who’s starting to think he should get danger money. But do be careful – it’s highly flammable.Michael Flarup (@flarup)Now THATS a scary Halloween costume.

These failings aren’t even redeemed by the elaborate back story – and you won’t get your money back.All in all, not worth the hassle, or the associated book deal.GOOD: renewable energySolar and turbines and wind, oh my! There’s nothing scarier in Canberra – prepare to empty entire rooms.YA BOY BILL NYE (@yaboybillnye)cant wait to dress up as a windmill for halloween because its never a bad time to teach people about renewable energy sourcesMay 23, 2016But this might be one to steer clear of if you’re in South Australia; everyone will have had the same idea.GOOD: the failed marriage equality plebisciteAt $160 million, this has to be the most expensive option on the list, and anyone with any sense will point out the obvious way you could have achieved the same effect faster and more efficiently. But it is truly scaremongering, with the added relevance of being dead.BAD: Pauline Hanson and Tony AbbottLook, we get it. You’re being satirical; the party’s going to be an #auspol crowd. These two people are the scariest things in Australia, hur hur hur.No. Not only is the spider eating the mouse obviously the scariest thing in Australia, but by assuming the form of real people with the ability to effect real policies that do real harm, you’re playing into the type of personality politics that let them get away with it.Dressing up as Hanson and Abbott in fact acts as exposure therapy – you’re distracting from the real issues. The only exception is the Republican presidential candidate. Halloween: the world’s last-ditch attempt to scare the US out of a Trump presidency.uncle jessy (@jessyjeanie)with trump polling at 7% percent this halloween isnt nearly as scary as i thought it would beOctober 24, 2016BAD: Harambe🌊fugget (@avocado_news)I found my Halloween costume pic.twitter.com/vIECcnxW6DOctober 9, 2016The gorilla died on late May, after being shot when a toddler fell into his enclosure in Cincinnati zoo, but he assumed a new life on social media – and almost as prime minister of Australia.

The fury subsides. The wounds heal. But as the trumpets and the drums depart, the same Brexit squabbles live on. What do we mean to do, really, about immigration, protectionism, sovereignty and trade?Cut to Wallonia, a desperate corner of Europe. Its collapsed heavy industry lies ruined in a hilly landscape. Its politics are equally outdated, socialists battling Marxists. Yet Wallonia’s politicians enjoy astonishing power, since the Belgian federation depends on allowing the province a veto on external treaties. Since the EU holds that a trade treaty with Canada requires unanimity of its 28 states, Wallonia’s veto is Belgium’s veto. Wallonia is the mouse that roars.Those wondering what this means for Brexit should read the history of Canada’s dealings with the EU. Ten years ago, a previous deal was wrecked by Canada, not by Belgium, when Quebec dairy farmers cast a veto and left the EU’s negotiators fuming. Now it is the turn of Wallonia’s dairy farmers to call a halt.EU trade deal with Canada on brink of collapse after Belgian disarray Read moreTrade deals are the lowest form of diplomatic life. The currently abortive Canadian treaty is a glutinous mess of beef hormones, investor protection, Romanian visas, patent term regulations and cheese definitions. The EU shot itself in the foot by declaring, late in the day, that the deal was subject to member unanimity, not majority voting. Canadian lawyers find this interpretation strange to the point of suspicion. It did not apply to the Paris climate change treaty.To leftwing Walloons, the EU may be in hock to monopoly capitalism. To British “hard Brexiters”, it is the opposite, a Trojan horse for socialist bureaucracy and external control. To the latter, the Wallonian fiasco proves only how useless the EU has become. If it wants a trade deal with post-Brexit Britain, it should set its house in order and then come cap in hand to London. Otherwise, Britain should shake hands with Canada and others round the world, and let Europe stew in its own juice.So far, so noble. I can see Boris Johnson and Liam Fox stomping the Ardennes, arm-in-arm with Walloon Marxists in defence of plucky little Belgium. Theirs is a coalition of the last stand against the heartless armies of the EU. What a contrast with the leaders of Britain’s Wallonias, Scotland and Wales, who last week traipsed to Downing Street, pleading for Brexit mercy from Theresa May. If Wallonia could stop Europe in its tracks, what about the equally oppressed tribes of the Celtic fringe? They got a flea in the ear.The Wallonian saga shows only the power of provincial lobbyists in ruling the terms of trade, both within and outside the EU. No one can seriously applaud the licence granted to the Walloons to shut out the Canadians. Even in Brexit Britain, leavers and remainers alike favoured free trade. Their chief argument was over “trade in what, and with whom?”That argument at least is starting to clear. On intra-European migration, May will be forced to concede virtually an open door to bankers, doctors, care workers, fruit pickers and other businesses dependent on foreign labour. It is simply not feasible to erect visa barriers round the UK’s borders, whether along the Channel coast or around Fermanagh and Tyrone. Whatever May says, Brexit is unlikely to make much difference to migration statistics. Her leadership should start lowering expectations.On trade in manufactured goods, the totals at stake are small, but not so for the 80% of businesses that are services and particularly affected by  non-tariff barriers. While the EU market in services remains embryonic, to stay must be in Britain’s interest. Everyone wants access to markets. Everyone accepts, and May concedes, that this means give and take. Give involves a surrender of control. There is no such thing as absolute sovereignty. Political Europe is in the process of decline, if not disintegrationIn June the British voted narrowly to leave the EU. Barring a revolution, that will plainly happen. But beyond “leaving”, all is pollster conjecture. “Hard” Brexit posits some EU relationship along Canadian lines. But even if a deal with Britain may be treated as more urgent, Wallonia shows how pressure groups can damage the public interest. In Britain’s case, transitional “default to World Trade Organisation” tariffs would be costly to the economy and, on the Irish border, unenforceable.Any Brexit cloud has a silver lining. Taking the heat out of London’s banking frenzy may be no bad thing. Devaluation can ease the strain of tariffs. Pending a storm of Wallonias – Germans on banking, the Dutch on pigs, half the EU on car assembly – ad hoc deals may be reached. But a cloud it would surely be. In the short term, there would be a net loss of business. Hence I cannot see how hard Brexit is in the nation’s interest, political or economic. The virtue of the residual European economic area (EEA) – some version of the so-called Norway option – is that it would take Britain out of the EU politically, but leave in place a common market. Trade in goods and services would remain, but at the price of their regulation, and that would have to be paid for.Political Europe is in the process of decline, if not disintegration. As refugees, bank bailouts, recession and unemployment all testify, the EU and especially the eurozone are not a functioning confederation but a zone of German influence. Britain has decided to distance itself from that zone. It cannot divorce itself from the economy of its entire continent. Caution and common sense advise the EEA, “soft” Brexit.Meanwhile, do not mock the Walloons. Their flexing of political muscle reflects a widespread identity crisis among all the world’s subordinate regions. From Scotland to Spain, from Ukraine to Turkey to Syria to the Gulf, the greatest threat to global stability – and its ally free trade – is sub-national separatism. The rebellion of local peoples against centralist power is everywhere.As Brexit stumbles forward, May should read the lessons of Wallonia. She should appease the Scots and others by granting them status in her impending negotiations. She is a remainer at heart. She may welcome a Wallonian card in her hand.TopicsBrexitOpinionEuropean UnionForeign policyBelgiumEuropeCanadacommentShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content

Ken Wiwa, who has died aged 47 after a stroke, was a journalist and author, adviser to three Nigerian presidents and a campaigner for social and environmental justice. As the eldest son of the poet, human rights activist and author Ken Saro-Wiwa, he struggled as a young man to forge his own identity. But following his father’s detention on a trumped-up accusation of murder, “Ken Junior”, as he was widely known, became a powerful advocate for peace and reconciliation, keeping the territory of Ogoniland on the world stage as a symbol of the injustice of oil exploitation in developing countries.Born in Lagos, Ken was sent from Nigeria to Britain, along with his mother, Maria, and four siblings, and studied at Tonbridge school in Kent. He had a complicated relationship with his wealthy anglophile father, a traditional Ogoni leader who had worked for both the Nigerian federal and state governments post-independence in 1960, but who devoted his later life to a struggle for Ogoni autonomy – and to fighting Shell’s presence in his homeland.High quality crude oil had been discovered by Shell in the small, 404 square mile area of the Niger delta close to Port Harcourt in south Nigeria in 1958. The elder Saro-Wiwa saw clearly that, rather than bringing wealth and prosperity, it had led to war, devastation, social division and the degradation of farm and fishing grounds.The flamboyant author, who expected his expensively educated son to return to Nigeria to continue his own political struggle for Ogoni autonomy, became increasingly a thorn in the side of Shell and the military government led by General Sani Abacha. Matters came to a head in 1994 when Saro-Wiwa led a peaceful revolt against the oil group. Shell was humiliated, forced to withdraw from Ogoniland and stop production in one of the world’s most oil-rich regions.The Ogonis had won a great victory in their fight for self-determination, but the price of their rebellion was the wrath of the military dictatorship. In 1994, Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders were accused of complicity in the murders of four Ogoni chiefs. The nine were detained in a military camp outside Port Harcourt to be tried by a special military tribunal.Their detention and subsequent torture posed a personal dilemma for the young Ken. Father and son had been close, but by his teens Ken felt intimidated and unable to develop his own identity. So great was his need for independence from his powerful and charismatic father that in 1992, at the age of 23, he changed his name in London to be rid of what he later called “the straitjacket of identity my father was trying to impose on me”.Becoming “Ken Wiwa”, however, was not the liberating experience he had hoped for. “[It] seemed flat and rather unimpressive next to the more colourful Ken Saro-Wiwa,” he said. Tellingly, it took Wiwa two years to break the news to his father of the rejection of his name. When he did so, it was by letter to the military camp where he was being held. The elder man was furious, writing back: “There is no way in our culture that Ken Wiwa can be the son of Ken Saro-Wiwa”.The dilemma was particularly acute because his father’s detention took place just as his own career was taking off in the UK. Wiwa had become the Guardian’s first online journalist, working with the New Media Laboratory, the groundbreaking forerunner of the paper’s full entry into the digital revolution that was soon to engulf the industry.As the detention of the Ogoni nine became an international issue, with environmental and human rights activists, writers and politicians all appealing to Abacha for clemency, Wiwa found himself sucked ever deeper into his father’s world of politics. In 1995, he gave up his job in journalism to dedicate himself to saving his father’s life, travelling the world to lobby politicians and heads of state to intervene, and to mobilise public opinion. The result was that his father’s name, which he had rejected, became a symbol of the emerging worldwide struggle for environmental justice.Abacha, however, was unmoved – and on 10 November 1995, Saro-Wiwa and the other Ogoni leaders were executed after the military tribunal found them guilty of murder. Their executions took place when Wiwa was in Auckland, New Zealand, to lobby the Commonwealth heads of state and Nelson Mandela, and triggered a worldwide outcry. The British prime minister, John Major, described it as “judicial murder”, Mandela declared it a “heinous act” and world figures joined the condemnation of Abacha. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth.When the outrage subsided, many expected Wiwa to return to Nigeria to take up his father’s mantle and lead the Ogoni struggle. But although his father had effectively been canonised, he again chose his own path. He had married Olivia Burnett in London in 1996, and the couple and their two sons, Felix and Suanu, went to live in Canada, where Wiwa became a writer-in-residence and a fellow at several universities and foundations, as well as a successful feature writer and TV and radio producer. In 2001, he published In the Shadow of a Saint: A Son’s Journey to Understand His Father’s Legacy, a moving memoir of a complex life lived between different cultures.Having at times felt isolated from Africa, Wiwa returned to his Nigerian roots. In 2005 he became a World Economic Forum “young global leader” and a member of the Africa advisory council of the Prince of Wales’s rainforests project. The Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo appointed him as his special assistant on peace, conflict resolution and reconciliation in 2006, and Wiwa later worked as an aide in Abuja to presidents Umaru Yar’Adua and Goodluck Jonathan.In 2009, he and the families of the other executed Ogoni leaders sued Shell in New York, accusing its Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), of having collaborated in their executions. The case never went to full trial, with Shell offering at the last minute to settle out of court for £9.6m. To this day, the company dismisses all claims made against it, saying it had attempted to persuade the Nigerian government to grant clemency.The landmark case was one of the first to see a multinational corporation accused of human rights violations, and confirmed that western corporations working in Africa could no longer act with impunity. It also paved the way for Shell to pay out over $50m in settlements to around 15,000 Ogoni people for pipeline pollution episodes in Ogoniland in 2011.Wiwa finally resolved his differences with his father, accepting his flaws and attributing to him his strong political conscience, and moral compass. “His influence remains in everything I do, especially in my relationships with my children,” he said in 2010. “I am much closer to him now, if that makes sense. In a way that’s how it should be with fathers and sons – I had to get away from him to become my own man, and once I had done that, it was easier to appreciate him as a man and a father.”He is survived by his wife and sons, and by his mother.• Ken Wiwa (Kenule Bornale Tsaro-Wiwa), writer and campaigner, born 28 November 1968; died 18 October 2016• This article was amended on 28 October 2016. Ken Wiwa went to Tonbridge school in Kent, not Malvern college in Worcestershire.TopicsNigeriaOilThe GuardianHuman rightsCanadaobituariesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
“Who were the first football club to have an official website?” wonders Chris White. “And how about an unofficial website? I noticed that TWTD, Ipswich Town’s unofficial fan site, has been going since 1995, so surely must be one of the first. Also, who were the first clubs to start using social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter?”Which footballers have played for the most teams in a single season? | The Knowledge Read more“I can help,” yells Martyn Amos, thrusting his arm in the air. “Ipswich Town were, indeed, the first club to have a website (unofficial or otherwise). In fact, I used to help maintain it. It was set up in 1990 by Phil Clarke, who worked at BT in Martlesham (near Ipswich) when the web was still very much experimental. He then passed it on (1993-1995) to Paul Felton, who was a student at UEA in Norwich (boo, hiss). “After Paul graduated, he passed it on to me, as I was, at the time, a PhD student at Warwick (1995-1996). Paul then took it back in 1996, and ran it until 2001, when the club finally woke up to the potential of the web, and got a local company called AWS to run it … There used to be some discussion with Sheffield United fans about our claim to primacy, but I believe that it was decided in our favour.”As for unofficial websites … “Very likely to be Reading’s Hob Nob Anyone which has been knocking around since November 1994,” reckons Peter Sorrill. “Although the distinction between ‘official’ and ‘unofficial’ was moot in the early 90s as most clubs weren’t that tech savvy. Here’s the Evening Post’s report on its 20th anniversary from 2014.” In it, founder Graham Loader explains that “I did computing and then I found out about the internet and realised you could do email and all that stuff. I didn’t think it would get big but it got quite big quite quickly. People would contact me and say how exciting it was that they could read about Reading in places like Canada and Australia.”But Alex Lopez-Ortiz thinks he can go earlier. “The ‘What’s New, September 1993’ NCSA web page lists: ‘Information on the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club at Nottingham University [website] is online.’ This is very early in the life of the web. NCSA mosaic, which was what popularised the web, was introduced in January of that year.”Tetris on the terraces“While watching the Faroe Islands getting thumped by Portugal last Monday, I realised that the annoyingly catchy chant the Faroese fans gamely kept up throughout the majority of the second half was actually the theme tune from the computer game Tetris,” emails Andy Ballard. “Is there any particular reason for this choice of anthem? And are there any other examples of fans appropriating songs/music (or any characters/imagery) that originated in computer games at matches?”We’re not certain of why, beyond its inherent catchiness, but this tune appears to be sung around the world. The theme to Tetris originated from a Russian folk song, Korobeiniki, about a peddler and a girl haggling over goods, it says here. The basic tune has popped up on football terraces in a few places, starting in Chicago.“Section 8, the supporters’ group for Chicago’s MLS team, the Chicago Fire, has used the song from Tetris as one of the regular chants for years,” notes xtomx. “Why, you ask? Guapo, one of the great Section 8 supporters, could play it on his trumpet, that’s why. Despite suffering the past few seasons under a terrible owner, the Fire do maintain a small group of dedicated fans, who remember better times with formerly great players (Piotr Nowak, Lubos Kubik, Hristo Stoichkov, Eric Wynalda, Tomasz Frankowski and Arne Friedrich).“We are now reduced to: making cracks at management; hate-watching the laughable players signed for the team; drinking Malört (Chicago’s “hometown” bitter spirit); and talking about the raccoon that invaded the upper deck of the stadium during a cup game two years ago, and has become the emblem of how far we have fallen. We laugh at ourselves, as it is the only thing that keeps us going.”Here’s the Chicago Fire fans in happier times:   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest On the other side of the world, it’s also an anthem for Western Sydney Wanderers:   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Back across the Pacific, and MLS side Portland Timbers use the same tune and similar lyrics, but throw in a bit of mass choreography for good measure:   Facebook    Twitter    Pinterest Know any more instances, or other 8-bit inspired chants? Get in touch.FumingLast week’s column looked at physios getting injured running on to the pitch. But reader David Hopkins reminded us of another.“In the 1930 World Cup semi-final between Argentina and the USA, the American team doctor Jack Coll ran on to treat an injured player, dropping his bag on to the pitch as he arrived to do so,” he emails. “This caused a bottle of chloroform inside the bag to break, leading to Coll being overcome by fumes … and being carried off himself.”Wandering players: a follow-upAlso last week, we had a section on players who have appeared for more than four clubs in a season, and while it doesn’t trump the seven of Jefferson Lewis, Mark A Thomas has another nomination. “Ray Wilkins played for five in the 1996-97 season. He started as player-manager at QPR (one of the reasons he left I believe was because he was picking himself too much), played under his mate Alan Smith at Wycombe for one game, headed to Hibs for a few games, then came back down to Millwall and Leyton Orient.”Meanwhile, Mitchel Ankers has a correction: “Whilst reading this week’s Knowledge, I spotted a minor inaccuracy regarding John Burridge’s career history.‘It should be said that he didn’t play all that much. Of the 19 clubs he’d signed for, he only played a total 29 games for half of them. Interestingly, he was listed as player-manager of his final club Blyth Spartans without actually playing.’“I have a vivid recollection of attending a first round FA Cup tie between Blackpool and Blyth Spartans in 1997 where John Burridge featured in goal for Blyth. As a nine-year old Blackpool fan at the time I knew nothing about him but I remember there being a lot of fanfare surrounding the return of a club legend, so I was convinced my memory was right. I then found this blog article which suggests that he did play in the match. I think the issue here is that Wikipedia only records league appearances so it’s not a reliable source on whether or not a player played for a club in any competition at all.”Wikipedia? Inaccurate? Surely not. Knowledge archive“Who is the shortest goalkeeper to have played for a major European club?” mused Daniel Koytchev three years ago.Immediately we shall dispense with the “major European club” aspect of this question, Daniel, because there aren’t that many wee keepers to go around. Only one gets close to satisfying your criteria, and that’s Bert Williams, who played for Wolves during the finest period in their history, winning the FA Cup in 1949 and the league title in 1954. Later that year Williams, who stood 5ft 9in tall in his socks, played in goal when Wolves beat Honved 3-2 in one of the ”floodlit friendlies” that inspired the European Cup. In the Pathé News footage you can see him making a double save at the end of the first half, leaving Wolves with just the two goals to make up in the second. Roy Swinbourne’s second goal, Wolves’ third, in the 78th minute, is a belter. Also in the late 1940s/early 50s, Wilf Chisholm stood between the sticks for Grimsby Town – all 5ft 8in of him.If we were playing Mallett’s Mallet, chances are you’d respond to “short goalkeepers” with “Jorge Campos” (or, if not, get biffed on the bonce). It’s been suggested that Campos was as short as 5ft 6in, but most sources put him at 5ft 8in – either way, he didn’t loom large in the penalty area, but he more than made up for any lack of height with his fashion sense (all goalkeepers should be asked to design their own shirts, please) and athleticism. Campos was always charging off his line, and even if he had committed himself going the wrong way, he often managed to wriggle back in to position to snaffle the ball away from the toes of attackers. Mexico have also had Óscar Pérez in goal, measuring 5ft 7in and known as the Rabbit for his leporidine agility.Also 5ft 7in was the Reading goalkeeper Steve Death (is this the only time anyone can have been “saved by Death”?), the man who went 11 matches without conceding a goal to set a then-record English total of 1,103 minutes without picking the ball out of the back of the net. In the promotion-winning 1978-79 season, he kept 26 clean sheets, conceding in only a quarter of Reading’s home matches. He wasn’t much of a kicker, but he was quick off his line and a great shot-stopper. After his debut for Reading, a 1-0 win over Brighton, one report called him “an insignificantly built bundle of daredevil energy”, a description we think rather lovely.For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.Can you help?“After the recent death of the King of Thailand it was announced that the current standings in the Thai football leagues will stand with three rounds of games still remaining,” reports Robert Davies. “This means that whoever was in the relegation zone at the time were relegated, whoever was leading the league was pronounced champion, etc. Has something like this ever happened before in any other leagues?”“A couple of evenings ago some friends and I realised that the exciting new Watford player (and nominative determinist) Isaac Success has only two unique consonants in his first name and surname combined,” cheers Jack Webb. “A friend later realised that Dele Alli also has only two. A whole series of questions flowed from this, none of which we got very far on. Are there any other world footballers who have only two consonants in their name, and who has the longest name with only two consonants? Do any have just the one consonant? And who has the fewest unique vowels in their name? For our discussion we disallowed footballers with only one name (Pelé, Kaka, etc) as that felt like cheating.”“The current Sligo Rovers goalkeeper, Michéal Schlingermann, hails from County Mayo and his dad is German,” reports Liam Maloney. “And he has the word ‘German’ as part of his surname. Are their other examples of players’ surnames containing a word that directly connects to their nationality or that of either of their parents?”Here’s Steve Dodds: “On discovering that the Bulgarian side, Ludogorets, who suffered a hiding at the hands of Arsenal the other night, have a name which is an anagram of ‘good result’, I was wondering if any readers of The Knowledge could suggest any other football-related anagrams of club names?”“Gareth Bale is the most expensive Welsh player at £86m and Joe Allen is the second highest at £15m,” writes Justin Anderson. “This must be the biggest difference in actual amounts but can any other countries boast a greater proportional difference between their first and second most expensive players (Bale’s fee is 5.7 times more than Allen’s)?”Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.TopicsSoccerThe KnowledgeShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailShare on LinkedInShare on PinterestShare on Google+Share on WhatsAppShare on MessengerReuse this content
