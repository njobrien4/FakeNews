In the week since J. election as president of the United much has been written about the potential conflicts of interest a sitting president with a global business may encounter other Less has been paid to the even fuzzier situation of the close family members of a sitting and their business interests though on it became clear that this is another potential at least when it comes to the first daughter Trump and a brand that is largely built on her image. A group of including reporters at The New Times and received an email from Trump Fine the upscale brand Ms. Trump founded in entitled and touting Trump wearing her favorite bangle from the Metropolis Collection on The a bracelet that costs on her was clearly pictured on her wrist during her interview with her stepmother and grown siblings with on night. Such emails are not uncommon among fashion which tend to trumpet every celebrity sighting in their products to the world at large. What was different about this was that it came not from the communications but from the vice president for the person in a brand who would generally work with a wholesale partners Ms. stores such as in and and Son in And that after pointing out the it urged recipients to share this with your In other it used Ms. appearance by her side to directly promote the selling of her products. When the vice said am not available for and when asked if she had sent the hung up the phone. But a day president of the Trump notification was sent by a marketing employee at one of our companies who was following customary and like many of is still making adjustments We are discussing new policies and procedures with all of our partners going This is not the first time Ms. brands have used her role in her political career for marketing purposes. In Ms. Trump wore a dress from her own collection to introduce her father at the Republican National Convention also wore her own brand shoes and The next her company tweeted out a picture of her from the podium with the words look from her and a link to the where a similar style from the brand was offered. The dress reportedly sold out in a day. At the the decision was met with some even though the stakes were lower. Trump has stated that his children will have no formal roles in his White because they will be running his and there is no law that prohibits presidential relatives from continuing their own though Section 713 of Title 18 of the United States Code forbids the use of likenesses of the presidential seal for promotional purposes. Ms. Trump has not come close to but the appearance is still ethically blurred. Whether or not Ms. Trump knew of the bracelet email before it was her name is still on the top of the alert. In the attempts by relatives to profit from a connection to a such as Billy introduction of Billy Beer during his brother and the creation of Roger during his half brother terms in were roundly deemed inappropriate. The tension between Ms. position on her transition team and her but role as a representative of women and the younger generation in his and the fact that she is her own best ad and her brand is thus understandably using her as a makes the issue even more and it underscores her status in the public eye and the amount of attention she will incur. The question now is how she uses it.
Since 23 the choice to leave the Union has been debated in largely as if it were a reflexive action something the nation does to itself. But must also be understood transitively something this country does to other countries. domestic considerations dominate the especially since separation talks have not begun.

The thing is that I still haven't heard an explanation of those reasons that makes sense beyond the obvious ones. Seeking to excuse or explain away the fact that millions of people have used their democratic choices in what by all ordinary measures are illogical and inexplicable ways may simply be ignoring a plain truth that those people decided that giving vent to their racism and xenophobia was worth the risk.

Earlier this week the Physical Society issued a press release congratulating Trump on his victory and encouraging him to sustained and robust funding of scientific research a top The received so many complaints that it felt compelled to retract it and issue an apology. Some have already written off science advisor. For of State University not sure science would because there be any Science get much except when it gets in the way or bolsters support for a political was called a upon taking the position under Bush. There are thousands of political including many science that will need to be expert advisory bodies constituted and and experts put into staff positions under the White House. Any scientist who agrees to hold their nose and work with the Trump administration should expect much of the same criticism received by such as government will not have much choice but to engage. That is their job. The rest of the scientific community must still ask itself some difficult questions. We suggest money all that the late stages of the presidential 69 Prize winners endorsed and pushed for more funding for research and policies that support the scientific workforce. They suggested that there were other reasons for their but focused on what the next president might do for the interests of the scientific incoming president of the Geophysical Union expressed a similar a fear that the scientific infrastructure in the is going to be on its Everything from funding to being able to attract the global leaders we need to do basic science Trump imagines that the scientific community could cause him one option would be to do what did to reactionary doctors in setting up the and their mouths with Trump could echo promising to science to its rightful by increasing funding. It would be the Art of the and it would put critical scientists in a difficult position. No one knows what Trump will do on science or much else. the history of US science funding shows that Republican presidents more eager to spend on than their Democratic Priorities have with Democrats spending more through the Environmental Protection Agency and Commerce while Republicans spend more on the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health. Overall spending on is not with party mainly because science funding has long been a bipartisan priority. Other than the massive injections of cash through the and smaller stimulus package more science funding has remained pretty stable as a proportion of government discretionary spending since the end of World War Two. Without much discussion of the fiscal Trump has announced grand plans for increases in US infrastructure investment. For this could mean funding for Perhaps Newt will revive his vision of a Moon base and a mission to Mars. The demoted since the end of the Cold could receive a boost. that advocate for more science funding have already sought to tie in funding with calls for greater investment. Scientists need to consider how to react to possible increases in funding as well as express fears of decreases. In doing they might position themselves as representatives of the public good rather than just another special interest group. Should pragmatism trump How should scientists engage on policy issues such as vaccination and climate where Republicans are often accused of being or at war with Despite rhetorical nods to the social conservative wing of his party during the campaign and his enthusiasm for convenient conspiracy he is clearly a pragmatist with little worry about changing his policy should therefore ask themselves whether they would support policies that did what they regard as the right but for the reasons. Policies focused on deploying electric vehicles and nuclear or wind power may be justified in purely economic rather than environmental terms. environmental regulations may provide convenient cover for the taxing of imports as the struggles to justify a new protectionism. When it comes to climate maybe the pragmatic business of policy design might finally take precedence over trying to convince a Republican Congress to see the world through a climate eyes. Two days after the election a spokesperson for tweeted the strong support of the agreement on climate change. Many environmental scientists have long seen as antithetical to their cause. Would they make peace with big oil in order to defend the Or will the battle against perceived enemies of science now take place on multiple would be easy for scientists to bring back an opposition strategy focused on defending a on Much harder will be for the science community to support a government under the control of President Trump and a Republican Congress. Choices will have to be made. Scientists should be aware that the that many followed to oppose President W Bush may not work as well under a less president.

A recent issue of Wired magazine brought into conversation with the gurus of Silicon Valley. hailed the magic bullets of telling best way for the tech industry to tackle inequality is for it to do what supposed to innovate in ways that create actual gains in growth and tells us how bad this analysis is. Technology tends to widen the gap between rich and simply because rich people are better able to take advantage of productivity gains than poor people. And yet the narrative of technology continues. Trump gave an interview to a heavily partisan news site that has become depressingly in which he with reference to artificial have always been concerned about the social breakdown of our culture caused by Now is the time to ask who really benefits from and to rethink the responsibilities of scientists in engaging with inequality. Scientists who choose not to engage with a Trump Administration risk fueling the resentment and disenchantment that brought it to power.

you anyone said that to you after one your happened to me. In if I had a pound for every time heard that I would be well on the way to bridging the pay gap between academic and technical teaching am a technical instructor. all about pushing buttons and pulling I even pronounce let alone deliver it. Many higher education institutes running degrees employ technical instructors to teach the areas not covered by the theory in the lecture rooms. My particular group of instructors is made up of people who have skills and experience. We are not recent graduates. We are industry professionals who want to pass on our skills so that students are equipped for the workplace when they makes how to become a vocational lecturer Read technical instructors get paid significantly less than academics. scholarly promotion opportunities and ridiculously long annual leave are not part of our contracts. We are placed in the same union as call workers and security staff. We are in a lower social class than our academic I mention that we have a different management structure from the entire academic This means that we get shown the qualitative data from the National Student which points to the technical team as the strength of the year after year. when I asked the academic manager to see the I was told it would a lot of before I could see it. The thing we do see as we have ways to circumnavigate the system. We understand that really means trying to withhold negative comments about some of their staff. Plus a bit awkward if it points to our technical team as a strength in the teaching and as we are paid significantly less than does sound a bit like and some people clearly know the difference between the two. I am referred to as a technician on a daily basis. I can only assume this word association is why we are the first port of call whenever there is a technical problem with something like slides. They call on us with teaching of although this would actually be more appropriate. After a lot of us are fellows of the Higher Education Academy and have far more teaching experience than a lot of am usually the first person through the door in the morning and the last to leave in the evening that is what happens when your hours are automatically technical support hours. Students know where we are based and we spend a lot of time talking them through queries. At the end of my teaching I have a queue of students waiting at the door to ask questions. Your lecturers are on strike because they are struggling to survive Read of these sessions are written by with no input from any course academic. They are steeped in psychology and practice. But this is not teaching. I wonder about the elephant in the room. You find surgery being taught to medical students by someone who had never worked as a surgeon. But you do get academics who have never worked a day outside of HE teaching subjects. got a huge amount of respect for many of my academic colleagues who work tirelessly. But I also see the ones that let the side are plenty of new training courses offering diplomas in the same subjects as our degrees. They have partnerships with industry as well. They are busy and even though they charge more than us. Their technical are called is a massive challenge ahead of us regarding the traditional models of courses and accreditation. The sector needs to appropriately and reward the those who make a difference in the classroom. is not a dirty word in industry and it should not be in higher education. Having two disjointed teaching teams is unhelpful and creates another political minefield that students have to navigate. There should be one equal teaching team made up of different academic technical industry practitioners and talented classroom teachers. Students would have one port of leading to better communication and a better overall experience. If we sort this one we will be able to trump any other new training institution.

Too many would regard it as a constitutional to go against the verdict delivered in the referendum. Others have a more practical fear of contradicting the wishes of their own local anxious they would pay the price with their own are the judges who ruled that should vote on Read that fear will only fully kick in if May presents them with a a motion to trigger article 50 or not. If the choice is any less stark than if May proposes detailed legislation then that would give plenty of wriggle room. They could say that while the public voted to they did not vote for this of leave. That would give the remain majority in parliament the chance to slow things down and demand a much softer other factors could prove decisive. The coherence of in parliament now matters. If the party can get its act together and unite the demand that remains a member of the single market then it will have real muscle. The early signs were not recall that the first public figure to demand the immediate triggering of article 50 was hours after the vote. But and others have set a good needs to press the case against hard strongly and other thing to remember is that parliament is not just the Commons. The Lords will have a say too. Unelected peers thwarting the will of the people may look like a democratic outrage. But and the rest can hardly complain. The Lords are an ancient part of our parliament. And parliament as they never stopped reminding us is Say If attempt to overturn public trust will fall even those of us who voted leave in order to ensure that our who make political decisions in this this ruling in the high court is a nice irony. I personally have a problem with anyone using any democratic or legal means to achieve any political end they want. And no doubt that have the right to cancel if they choose to do I would advise them to use their power respectfully and wisely. The reputation of the political classes in this country is already very and any attempt to overturn the referendum result is likely to send it down even further with baleful make any difference in the long run is a moot point. There are powerful vested interests in the already at work to get the ballot overturned or render it meaningless. There are equally powerful interests in the itself who are willing to help them out. I bet against them succeeding. As the and have referendums in the are flexible friends. But that will leave a pertinent question do votes actually count for anything in these or are they merely glorified opinion the public must get a say on the final the Conservative commitment to the principles of parliamentary representative it is disappointing that decision had to be made in the court. a failure to consult elected representatives of the public on the terms of the negotiation package would undermine the very principles that and Fox have championed. this will provide some clarity on what has been a completely chaotic showing from the government so will be vital that parliament now works productively together to get the best possible negotiating deal to take to Given the strict timetable of exiting the once article 50 is it is critical that the government now lays out its negotiations to before such a vote is held. So team have been all over the place when it comes to what is best for and time they pull their socks up and start taking this the people voted for a departure but not for a which is why what really matters is allowing them to vote again on the final giving them the chance to say no to an irresponsible hard that risks our economy and our The appeal is unlikely to succeed Twitter Prime minister May. government has announced that it will appeal against a judgment by a court that restores sovereignty to the parliament to legislate for the legal landscape. Even for the sake of that just looks bad. The Vote Leave camp campaigned for sovereignty to be restored to the parliament. It is symptomatic of their many inconsistencies that they now argue that this crucial decision ought not to be taken by has caused havoc already. Now parliament must save us Read three days of legal the writing was on the wall for the government when it was forced to make the significant concession that article 50 is both unconditional and irrevocable. That might be true but it is at least open to challenge legally. The irony of the appeal is that it now opens up the box of whether the article 50 question on can be answered only by the court of justice. If what sort of delay will that my the government has poor prospects of succeeding in the supreme court. The high key reasoning is that the government without the intervention of parliament confer rights on individuals or deprive individuals of There is no answer to this. The removal of the ability to seek authoritative rulings of the for is but one material change in our and it may have a profound impact on fundamental and social rights. other major rights merely by the arguments. I see a comeback to the various fatal gaps in the which the court found to be most fundamental rule of constitutional law is that parliament is and that legislation enacted by both Houses of Parliament is supreme. If means the court has confirmed that only parliament can trigger it. Both Houses of Parliament now need to stand up for the national interest and demand accountability from the and for their constituents. The courts have done their bit for the rule of law. on behalf of all of now needs to do the This is what taking back control really ruling is a huge victory for our parliamentary democracy. This is what real sovereignty looks and this is what taking back control really decision is about parliamentary sovereignty and our constitution. It is not about leave or remain it is actually about whether we have a sovereign parliament in this and as such the decision is the right got a Bill of Rights in 1689 which gave parliament powers and took power away from the executive and the monarch. Those who wanted to leave the campaigned on the basis of parliamentary so it would have been completely inconceivable for the executive to overreach its prerogative powers and trigger article 50 without any form of parliamentary scrutiny or specifically legislated to hold an so it is now important that the government puts its plans before parliament so that can these plans before the decision on triggering article 50 and beginning the This ruling halt but further everyone. high court ruling does not mean parliament will prevent They what is they Why because they may not get a chance to. The judgment is not the end of the there is an appeal to come. But assume the supreme court upholds the verdict. Parliament then would have a right to vote on the triggering of article 50. Will they use this opportunity to block the Almost certainly the 650 479 are reckoned to have backed remain over half of Conservative So there prior to the a parliamentary majority in of remaining. But things have changed since 23 For one elected representatives were shown to be out of touch with their 421 of 574 and Welsh parliamentary constituencies voted to leave. Polling that significantly more than of 2015 Conservative voters and more than of voters backed leave. Voting against a referendum result generated by many of their own voters is not something many would willingly countenance court what does it all Read most parliament seems likely to do is to impose procedural conditions on the prime minister. These may include the need to report back regularly on the negotiations providing the kind of running commentary she has resisted to date. Yet even it is hard to see how can materially affect the final outcome. Article 50 lays down a deadline. Once a deal is they will face a choice between whatever May has achieved and no deal at all. There will be no scope to modulate what is on the this is as it should be. not as if politics was held in high regard before the referendum. I shudder to think what would happen following a unique democratic moment that the population in a way even elections fail a parliament that had approved the legislation providing for the vote decided to overturn it because it had come up with the so to the final irony.
