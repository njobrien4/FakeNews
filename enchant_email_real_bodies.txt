An email I received from a reader some time ago has begun to haunt me. The sister was dying of cancer. she asked would I respond to the word in the context of a cancer My correspondent did not gloss over the miseries of her terminal state. She outlined a series of horrific tests that led doctors to withhold food. She described infections and the caused by edema.

Why should a cancer patient be expected to lift her own spirits or anyone it hard enough dealing with such dire circumstances without having to become a booster for oneself and for One scholar of cancer decries tyranny of that gets too many patients making us feel guilty about expressing understandable anguish. During the intervening I have interacted with friends as they confronted an irreversible condition and have witnessed a kind of grace that I found inspiring.

A disposition that works to perfect the grace cannot be known or acquired through beliefs or deeds. In the the word for appears in the benediction the Lord be gracious to though the word for is used more frequently to denote an unmerited gift. For believers who seek this benefit from as for nonbelievers who seek it grace remains a highly elusive but highly desirable especially in troubled times.

President legacy looked on not long to include a major push against deeply entrenched housing segregation. In his administration rolled out a rule requiring local communities to assess their own patterns of racial and income segregation and make genuine plans to address them. The move followed years of debate and came as segregated cities like and faced renewed bouts of racial unrest. The federal advocates was finally trying to repair a promise of the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Now that rule is likely to be undermined and possibly erased by a Department of Housing and Urban Development headed by On J. Trump officially offered the cabinet post to a neurosurgeon and a former presidential who grew up poor in but has no experience in housing policy. While we know little about what would do at the he has played down the role of government in his own story. you his mother taught according to his autobiography have only yourself to And he has specifically criticized the housing rule. Known as furthering fair the rule has been politically contentious. Its backers argue that it is essential to remedying the long history of government and discrimination that has resulted in segregated neighborhoods persisting to this day. Critics say that the rule amounts to government overreach into the decisions and demographic makeup of individual communities and a free housing market. Republicans in Congress have tried to its implementation. wrote last year that the new policy followed the history of failed and would redirect housing primarily into white communities that oppose it. If he is confirmed by would have wide latitude to shape or slow the of the along with broader enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. the president of the National Low Income Housing said interpretation of the rule as a social experiment a fundamental misunderstanding of obligations that have been around since The Fair Housing Act passed that year included two one banning discrimination in the housing and the other requiring local communities to the goal of integration. The latter language means that not enough to punish landlords or communities who intentionally deny minorities housing. Communities also have a responsibility to actively ensure open housing which exist today neither in public housing clusters on segregated South Side nor in exclusive New City suburbs that use zoning laws to outlaw multifamily housing. and Jack past Republican acknowledged that second implication of the law. But for much of the time since the Fair Housing Act was this mandate has been largely ignored by both local communities and itself. The administration rules were an effort to address that oversight. And some advocates have spent just as long fighting for it. recently told Fox News that cannot have a strong nation if we have weak inner is the very insight that motivated Senator another Republican to include a provision in the 1968 Fair Housing Act requiring counties and states to further fair as a condition of receiving federal a lawyer with the law firm wrote in an email. The administration rule nothing like the partisan caricatures that have sprung up around said of the Poverty and Race Research Action Council. Many advocates wanted the rule to be much tougher than what emerged from several years of debate with local communities. In the rule provides those communities with detailed data on factors like racial poverty school quality and housing voucher use to help them determine whether and minority families are isolated from good schools or segregated from opportunity. The rule requires communities to use that information to draft plans to reduce segregation where it exists. Those that habitually defy the requirements risk lose funding from the agency. The first round of communities scheduled to complete the process have been at work on assessments due over the coming year. Before a new administration hostile to the idea could begin writing another rule that would reverse this or it could simply halt implementation. Or Congress could pass a law even as it remains on the books. For all the years that went into shaping the a new administration could relatively easily set it aside. That would also fundamentally change the conversation in about how segregated communities came to exist in their current incarnation. and other critics call efforts to dismantle them but these places were created through policies that can themselves be labeled social redlining that denied blacks policies that concentrated public housing in minority government decisions to locate highways that isolated them further. While many of these policies were first put into place decades communities remain shaped by them today.

J. Trump sat down on with editors and columnists of The New Times for an exclusive interview. Times reporters have annotated portions of the interview. The full transcript is available here. The personal interactions between President and Trump have so far been but not clear that the moment will last. has already indicated that he may weigh in against Trump once the new administration takes especially if the new president attacks legacy achievements. Here is our story on the cordial meeting between Trump and in the Oval Office. Trump is working to reset his mercurial relationship with the media as he looks toward assuming starting with this meeting at what he branded the New during his presidential campaign. But he still nurses intense grievances toward news outlets in general and The Times in particular. Here is more about relationships with the news media and The Times. Trump is hinting that even though federal law does not require him to do anything specific to separate himself from his vast business he is inclined to submit to some sort of voluntary standard of ethics that would avoid conflicts of interest or their appearance. But he leaves open the possibility that there may not be a way to accomplish it. This story has more about business ties. Trump is correct that federal for the most exempts the President from conflict of interest meaning he is allowed to take actions that could benefit his financial holdings. But in modern most presidents have voluntarily put their financial assets into blind trusts. Trump has said he does not intend to take such a instead will turn his companies over to his children. Read this story for more on potential conflicts of interest. The Wall Street Journal editorial among has suggested that the only solution to potential conflicts of interest is to sell off all of his and then have a blind trust reinvest the proceeds. Trump suggests that this is not practical. crowds at rallies frequently targeted chanting her and referring to her as a criminal. In Trump himself encouraged a crowd in telling them starting to agree with as they chanted her In despite remarks the and the Justice which have investigated email server and the conduct criminal inquiries largely independently of the White House.

Whether this is and to what will be one of the pivotal stories of the new Trump and crucial to figuring out how much or how little he can get done.

If you think back to this presidential campaign and recall a lot of articles mentioning email troubles and J. various you be wrong. If it seems there were fewer articles about the economy and because there were. The temptation to blame news organizations for this imbalance is but there is at least some reason to resist it. Critics have long assailed campaign coverage as focused too much on candidate campaign strategy and assessments of instead of on policies and ideas. But this the candidates share the blame. I compared the content of campaign ads with the content of news articles about two specific candidate traits or and the economy or jobs. Both the candidates and news organizations spent more time discussing the fitness for office lack of than they did the economy. And the imbalance grew more lopsided as the election approached. Using analytic tools provided by Crimson I categorized the campaign news coverage of 23 media outlets. This consisted of four broadcast three cable news National Public Radio and on the two news and 12 newspapers. I specifically searched for news about campaign and her email server or her campaign and and several controversies connected to campaign things like Trump the Khan family and the I also looked for news about the campaign appeals on the economy and jobs. This list but it gives a sense of the between coverage of these controversies and the economy. The controversies received more on than their views on the economy. From until Election 38 percent of the stories mentioned various and 35 percent mentioned email. Only 17 percent mentioned Trump and jobs or the and only 10 percent cited campaign and the economy. Closer to the from 8 the numbers got even more lopsided. This was an important date just after the release of the video and a few weeks before Director B. letter to Congress. From this 53 percent of the campaign articles mentioning either controversies or the economy discuss while only 6 percent mention her alongside jobs or the economy. As for 31 percent mention his while 10 percent mention him related to jobs and the economy. The imbalance in coverage of the character is as is the lack of coverage about the economy compared with the controversies. Moving one week past the video between 15 and Election roughly half of the stories about scandals and the economy mentioned and only a quarter discussed Trump and his imbroglios. A mere 7 percent of the stories in these last three weeks mentioned and the economy percent mentioned Trump and the These choices have consequences. According to the reports of what they heard or read about between and were mainly references to her handling of emails during her time as secretary of state. In mentions of Trump changed week by tracking what was happening on the campaign trail. But before anyone blames the news important to examine what the candidates themselves were talking about over the course of the campaign. If media reports reflect candidate discourse then it is not merely the media choosing to report on scandals. It might be at least as much the choosing to campaign on them that results in unending coverage of traits and characteristics. To figure out if this was the I used data from on all the campaign ads aired between and Election Day. I coded all of the appeals in each ad and weighted the appeals by how many times the ads ran on television. made more ads than and she vastly running nearly three times as many ads as he did. All over half a million ads were run in 2016 during this period. The content of the ads is revealing. Both candidates spent most of their television advertising time attacking the other character. In the losing ads did little else. More than of the appeals in advertisements nearly half of were about characteristics or dispositions. Only 9 percent of appeals in her ads were about jobs or the economy. By 34 percent of appeals focused on the taxes and trade. Since the start of presidential campaign television advertising in no campaign has made 76 percent of its television ad appeals about any single topic. On traits typically garner about 22 percent of the appeals. The economy typically generates about 28 percent of the appeals. usually much more balance. Of this was an unusual election with two very unpopular so the flaws may have simply been too big a story for either them or the media to pass up. Whatever the the criterion of fitness for office dominated the messaging and made up a good share of the Trump messaging as and the news media covered it.

publisher of The New Thank you very much for joining us. And I want to reaffirm this is on the record. J. of the United All so clear. We had a very nice meeting in the Room. a I I I am. a photo of the great man behind you. There was a big thing about the bust that was removed out of the Oval Office. I heard thinking of putting it back. I indeed. I am. Wonderful. So got a good collection here from our newsroom and editorial and our columnists. I just want to say we had a but useful and conversation in there. So I appreciate that very much. I appreciate too. I thought maybe start this off by asking if you have anything you would like to start this off with before we move to the easiest questions going to get this administration. I just appreciate the meeting and I have great respect for The New Times. Tremendous respect. very special. Always has been very special. I think been treated very rough. well out there that been treated extremely unfairly in a in a true sense. I only complain about The Times. I would say The Times was about the roughest of all. You could make the case The Post was but every once in a while actually get a good article. Not but every once in awhile. I have great respect for The and like to turn it around. I think it would make the job I am doing much easier. working very hard. We have great people coming in. I think be very impressed with the names. be announcing some very shortly. Everybody wanted to do this. People are giving up tremendous careers in order to be subject to you folks and subject to a lot of other folks. But giving up a lot. I mean some are giving up tremendous businesses in order to sit for four or maybe eight or whatever the period of time is. But I think going to see some tremendous tremendous talent coming in. We have many people for every job. I mean no matter what the job we have many incredible people. I you can sort of just confirm that. The quality of the people is very good. choice for chief of trying very hard to get the best people. Not necessarily people that will be the most politically correct because that been working. So we have really experts in the field. Some are known and some are not but known within their field as being the best. very important to me. You been given a great honor. been very tough. been 18 months of brutality in a true but we won it. We won it pretty big. The final numbers are coming out. Or I guess coming out. just being confirmed. But the numbers are coming out far beyond what wildest expectation was. I know if it was I we were seeing the kind of crowds and kind the kind of enthusiasm we were getting from the people. As you probably I did many speeches that last period. I was just telling that I went around and did speeches in the pretty much 11 different that the massive crowds we were getting. If we had a stadium that held and most of many of you were there that held 20,000 have 15,000 people outside that get in. So we came up with a good system we put up the big screens outside with a very good loudspeaker system and very few people left. I would during the last two or three a day. a lot. Because not easy when you have big crowds. Those not an easy way of doing three a day. Then I said the last two I want to do six and seven. And not sure anybody has ever done that. But we did six and we did seven and the last one ended at 1 in the morning in And we had 31,000 17,000 or 18,000 inside and the rest outside. This massive place in Grand I guess. And it was an incredible thing. And I left do we lose I think we can lose And the reason I did it was set up only a little while before because we heard that day that was hearing that going to lose which been lost in 38 years. Or something. But 38 years. And they want to lose So they went out along with President and Bill and they went to late sort of late afternoon and I go to It on the schedule. So I finished up in New and at 10 I went to We got there at 12 We started speaking around and we had 31,000 people and I I there are things happening. But we saw it everywhere. So we felt very good. we had great numbers. And we thought going to win. We thought we were going to win We thought we were going to win North We did pretty easily. We thought strongly we were going to win The problem is nobody had won it and it was as you the great state that always got away. Every Republican thought they were going to win for 38 years and they just win it. And I thought we were going to win it. And we won we won you relatively we won it by a number of points. we won by 180,000 was that the More than 180,000 and votes are still coming in from the which we are getting about 85 percent of. So we won that by a lot of votes you we had a great victory. We had a great victory. I think it would have been easier because I see every once in awhile somebody the popular the popular vote would have been a lot but a whole different campaign. I would have been in I would have been in and New and we have gone anywhere else. Which I mean rather do the popular vote from the standpoint think do actually as well or better a whole different campaign. if a like match play versus stroke play. a whole different game. But I think the popular vote would have been easier in a true sense because go to a few places. I think the genius of the Electoral College. I was never a fan of the Electoral College until now. Until now. Until now. I guess now I like it for two reasons. What it does do is it gets you out to see states that never see otherwise. very interesting. Like I went to four times. I went to 2 for because everybody was saying you can get to 269 but there is no path to 270. We learned that was false because we ended up with got to got to get in. But there is no path to you have to get the one in so we kept going back to and we did get the one in We kept going to and we went to a lot of states that you spend a lot of time in and it does get you we actually went to about 22 whereas if going for popular probably go to or it could be three. You leave New stay in New and stay in So a certain genius about it. And I like it either way. But sort of interesting. But we had an amazing period of time. I got to know the we have a great a great and the enthusiasm was really incredible. The Times had a poll which was interesting because I was always up in that poll. They had something that I a technique in it was called enthusiasm. They added an enthusiasm factor and my people had great and people have enthusiasm. And in the end she get the vote and we ended up close to 15 as you know. We started off at we ended up with almost 15. And more a lot of people show because the community liked me. They liked what I was saying. So they necessarily vote for but they show which was a big problem that she had. I ended up doing very well with which was which I never understood why I was doing because go to the rallies and have so many women holding up for But I kept reading polls saying that not doing well with women. I think whoever is doing it here would say that we did very well with especially certain women. DEAN executive editor of The New As you describe you did do something really remarkable. You energized a lot of people in the country who really wanted change in But along with that and this is going to create a tricky thing for you you also energized presumably a smaller number of people who were evidenced at the convention in this weekend. Who have a very I just saw that today. love to hear you talk about how going to manage that group of people who actually may not be the larger group but who have an expectation for you and are angry about the country and its along racial lines. My first question do you feel like you said things that energized them in and how are you going to manage I think Dean. First of I want to energize the group. not looking to energize them. I want to energize the and I disavow the group. I know if reporting or whatever. I know where they were four years and where they were for and and all of the other people that so I just I had nothing to compare it to. But not a group I want to and if they are energized I want to look into it and find out why. What we do want to do is we want to bring the country because the country is very and one thing I did big league. very and going to work very hard to bring the country together. I somebody that really has gotten along with people over the years. It was my I went to a big event about two years ago. Just after I started thinking about politics. And walking in and some people were cheering and some people were and she you have never booed for never had a person boo and all of a sudden people are booing me. She never happened before. politics. You all of a sudden they think going to be running for and a say. So something that I had never experienced before and I people are and she never booed before. But now they boo. You it was a group and another group was going the opposite. I want to bring the country together. very important to me. in a very divided country. In many ways divided. So going to do that thing that executive editors get to do which is to invite reporters to jump in and ask questions. political thank Dean. like to thank you for being here. This talked about not prosecuting We were hoping you could talk about exactly what that means does that mean just the or the emails and the and how you came to that decision. there was a report that somebody said that not enthused about it. I want to move I want to move back. And I want to hurt the I really She went through a lot. And suffered greatly in many different ways. And I am not looking to hurt them at all. The campaign was vicious. They say it was the most vicious primary and the most vicious campaign. I added it was definitely the most I assume you sold a lot of newspapers. I would imagine. I would imagine. just telling not looking to hurt them. I think been through a lot. gone through a lot. really looking I think we have to get the focus of the country into looking forward. If I could we had a good conversation you and and it was off the but there was nothing just wanted to make sure. The idea of looking forward was one of the themes that you were saying. That we need to now get past the deputy managing So definitively taking that off the The but the question was asked. About the emails and the but just not something that I feel very strongly about. I feel very strongly about health care. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill that I think even the people in this room can be happy. You been talking about immigration bills for 50 years and ever happened. I feel very strongly about an immigration bill fair and just and a lot of other things. There are a lot of things I feel strongly about. not looking to look back and go through this. This was a very painful period. This was a very painful election with all of the email things and all of the foundation things and all of the everything that they went through and the whole country went through. This was a very painful period of time. I read recently where it it they used to say it was against whoever and none of us were there to see it. And there a lot of recordings of But the fact is that there were some pretty vicious they say this this was the most. They say it was definitely the most vicious primary. And I think very important to look forward. senior editor for Do you think it would disappoint your supporters who seemed very animated by the idea of accountability in the What would you say to I think they will be disappointed. I think I will explain that we have in many ways save our country. Because our really in big trouble. We have a lot of trouble. A lot of problems. And one of the big I talk divisiveness. I think that a lot of people will appreciate not doing it for that reason. doing it because time to go in a different direction. There was a lot of and I think that the people that supported me with such where they will show up at 1 in the morning to hear a speech. It was actually Election they showed up so that was essentially Election Day. I think understand very completely. L. opinion can I ask a One of the issues that you actually were very careful not to speak about during the and spoken about is one very near and dear to my the whole issue of climate the how approach it. You own some of the most beautiful links golf courses in the world cross I read your article. Some will be even better because actually like is a little bit off so be perfect. He say that. He just says that the ones that are near the water will be but will be in great shape. But really important to and I think to a lot of our to know where going to go with this. I think anyone objects you doing forms of energy. But are you going to take out of the lead of confronting climate looking at it very Tom. tell you what. I have an open mind to it. going to look very carefully. one issue interesting because there are few things where more division than climate change. You tend to hear but there are people on the other side of that issue who even We do hear it. I was on with this so I got an earful of it. is one of them. But a lot of smart people disagree with you. I have a very open mind. And going to study a lot of the things that happened on it and going to look at it very carefully. But I have an open mind. since living on an I want to thank you for having an open mind. We saw what these storms are now seen it personally. Straight up. But you have an open mind on I do have an open mind. And had storms Not like this. You know the hottest day ever was in 98. You you can make lots of cases for different views. I have a totally open mind. My uncle was for 35 years a professor at He was a great scientist. He was a great guy. And he was a long time he had feelings this was a long time ago he had feelings on this subject. a very complex subject. not sure anybody is ever going to really know. I know we they say they have science on one side but then they also have those horrible emails that were sent between the scientists. Where was in or wherever five years Terrible. Where they got you so you see that and you this all about. I absolutely have an open mind. I will tell you Clean air is vitally important. Clean crystal clean water is vitally important. Safety is vitally important. And you you mentioned a lot of the courses. I have some very successful golf courses. received so many environmental awards for the way you know. done a tremendous amount of work where received tremendous numbers. Sometimes say actually an environmentalist and people will smile in some cases and other people that know me understand true. Open mind. editorial page When you say an open you mean just not sure whether human activity causes climate Do you think human activity is or I think right now I think there is some connectivity. There is something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much going to cost our companies. You have to our companies are noncompetitive right now. really largely noncompetitive. About four weeks I started adding a certain little sentence into a lot of my that lost 70,000 factories since W. Bush. 70,000. When I first looked at the I must be a typo. It be you have you think you have 70,000 factories And it a right. lost 70,000 factories. not a competitive nation with other nations anymore. We have to make ourselves competitive. not competitive for a lot of reasons. becoming more and more of the reason. Because a lot of these countries that we do business they make deals with our or and then they adhere to the you know that. And much less expensive for their companies to produce products. So going to be studying that very and I think I have a very big voice in it. And I think my voice is listened especially by people that believe in it. And let you know. hate to see Royal underwater. The North that could a good bureau I just wanted to follow up on the question you were asked about not pursuing any investigations into Did you mean both the email investigation and the foundation investigation you will not pursue either one of you know have people that do things but my inclination would for whatever power I have on the is to say go forward. This has been looked at for so long. Ad go forward. And you you could also make the case that some good work was done in the foundation and they could have made etc. etc. I think I think time for people to say go and solve some of the problems that we which are massive problems you I do think that gone through a lot. I think losing is going through a lot. It was a it was a very tough evening for her. I think losing is going through a lot. for whatever my attitude is strongly we have to go we have so many different problems to I think we have to delve back in the past. I also think that would be a very well I think it would be very you know talking about bringing and then they go into all sorts of I think it would be very divisive for the country. I I think speaking not as a journalist very healthy. and then going to go D. White House Mike Shear. I cover the White covering your administration See ya there. Just one quick clarification on the climate do you intend as you pull out of the Climate going to take a look at it. SHEAR And if the reaction from foreign leaders is to slap tariffs on goods to offset the carbon that the United States had pledged to is that with And then the second question is on your sort of mixing of your global business interests and the presidency. even just in the two weeks been instances where met with your business partners Sure. talked about the impact of the wind farms on your golf course. experts who are lawyers and ethics say that all of that is totally so I guess the question for you what do you see as the appropriate structure for keeping those two things and are there any lines that you think you want to cross once in the White First of on countries. I think that countries will not do that to us. I think if run by a person that understands leadership and negotiation in no position to do that to no matter what I do. in no position to do that to and that but going to take a look at it. A very serious look. I want to also see how much this is you the cost to and be talking to you folks in the future about having to do with what just took place. As far as you potential conflict of I mean I know that from the the law is totally on my the president have a conflict of interest. been reported very widely. Despite I want there to be a conflict of interest anyway. And the the president And I understand why the president have a conflict of interest now because everything a president does in some ways is like a conflict of but I built a very great company and a big company and all over the world. People are starting to when they look at all these different like in and other number a job like that builds great relationships with the people of so all good. But I have to the partners come very successful people. They come they it be possible to have a my children are working on that job. So I can say to want to have a I can take a picture. I I think wonderful to take a picture. fine with a picture. But if it were up to some I would ever see my daughter again. That would be like you never seeing your son again. That be good. That be good. But ever see my daughter That means have to make deputy you know. I I yeah. I do that either. I that work. I do I would never see I guess the only son be allowed to at least for a little would be because 10. so there has to be a very interesting case. You could sell your company With all due you could sell your company and then Well And then you could see them all the time. a very hard thing to you know because I have real estate. I have real estate all over the which now people are understanding. When I filed my forms with the federal people really a big a big It really is all over the world. a great company with great assets. I think you selling real estate like selling stock. Selling real estate is much in a much different world. say and I mean this and I said it on the other My company is so unimportant to me relative to what I need I need and by the very I have a very small percentage of my money in very very small percentage of my money in in banks have said like to loan you like to give you any amount of been there had it both been been especially as you get is much better. Just a because an important question. I care about my company. I if a partner comes in from or if a partner comes in from where we did a beautiful big building that just and they want to take a picture and come into my and my kids come in I originally made the deal with these I mean what am I going to not going to talk to not going to take You have you on a human you take pictures. But I just want to say that I am given the right to do something so important in terms of so many of the issues we in terms of health in terms of so many different things. I care about my company. It matter. My kids run it. say I have a conflict because we just opened a beautiful hotel on so every time somebody stays at that if they stay because I guess you could say a conflict of interest. a conflict of but not going to have anything to do with the and they may very well. I mean it could be that occupancy at that hotel will be occupancy at that hotel will be probably a more valuable asset now than it was The brand is certainly a hotter brand than it was before. I help but I care. I said on I care. Because it matter. The only thing that matters to me is running our country. political can I press you a little further on what structures you would put in place to keep the presidency and the company separate and to avoid things for were reported in The Times in the past 24 hours about meeting with leaders of about wind farms About meeting with Leaders of about wind farms that might interfere with the views of your golf course and how to what can you talk about that by the Was I involved with the wind farms not that I know of. I I have a problem with wind But you brought it up in the Which I know. I might have. With leaders of MANY With I see. I might have brought it up. But not having to do with just I the wind is a very deceiving thing. First of we make the windmills in the United States. made in and Japan. made out of massive amounts of which goes into the whether in our country or it goes into the atmosphere. The windmills kill birds and the windmills need massive subsidies. In other subsidizing wind mills all over this country. I for the most part they work. I think they work at all without and that bothers and they kill all the birds. You go to a you know in they have what is The golden And if you shoot a golden they go to jail for five years and yet they kill them they actually have to get permits that only allowed to kill 30 or something in one year. The windmills are devastating to the bird With that being a place for them. But they do need subsidy. if I talk negatively. been saying the same thing for years about you the wind industry. I want to subsidize it. Some environmentalists agree with me very much because of all of the things I just including the and some But hard to explain. I care about anything having to do with anything having to do with anything other than the country. But the just to be the question. How do you formalize the separation of these things so that there is not a question of whether or not you as president are trying to influence like wind I want to influence because not not that important to me. hard to explain. but the according to the see I figured something where you put something in this massive trust and also nothing is written. In other in I can be president of the United States and run my business 100 sign checks on my which I am phasing out of very you I sign the type. I like to sign checks so I know what is going on as opposed to pressing a computer and thousands of checks are automatically sent. It it tells me going on a little bit and it tells contractors that watching. But I am phasing that out and handing that to Trump and Don Trump and Trump for the most and some of my so happening right now. But in theory I could run my business and then run the country perfectly. And never been a case like this where if you look at other people of they have this kind of asset and this kind of frankly. just a different thing. But there is no I assumed that have to set up some type of trust or whatever and you know. And I was actually a little bit surprised to see it. So in theory I have to do anything. But I would like to do something. I would like to try and formalize because I care about my business. is going to run very nice. We own this incredible place in We own many incredible including I guess you heard. one guy that does when I say you know what that right. Do a little But going to run we have good going to run really well. So I have to do but I want to do something if I can. If there is something. Can you promise us when you decide exactly what that come tell The New Times about I will. started it already. One of our great by the way. I can see that. started it already I greatly reduced the and the business. greatly reduced meetings with meetings with different people you also started by said over the last two once I decided I wanted to I want to build anything. like for we built the post be happy to ahead of schedule and under budget. Substantially ahead of schedule. Almost two years ago of schedule. But ahead of under and a terrific place. the hotel on Just so you General Electric has a big wind turbine factory in South Just so you know. Well good. But most of are made in most of are you and the are making most of them. They may assemble if you I think find that delivered there and they do most of the assembly. White House sorry I entered but I did want to ask you about You should introduce yourself. one of the White House correspondents. I apologize for my delayed flight. I wanted to ask you about personnel. They say personnel is policy. I quite hear. Personnel. Personnel. You hired to be the chief strategist for you in the White House. He is a hero of the been described by some as racist and I wonder what message you think you have sent by elevating him to that position and what you would say to those who feel like that indicates something about the kind of country you prefer and the government run. known a long time. If I thought he was a or or any of the things that we you the terms we can I even think about hiring him. First of the one that makes the not or anybody else. And will tell you that. 100 percent. And if he said something to me in terms of his or that I thought were inappropriate or number one I do and number he would have to be gone. But I know many people that know and in actually getting some very good press from a lot of the people that know and people that are on the left. But went to he was you he was very he was a Naval I think you I think very hard on him. I think having a hard time with it. Because not him. not him. known him for a long time. a very smart guy. I think he was with on top of everything else. What do you make of the website he The different. cover I mean like The New Times covers things. I I could say that is because they covered an story. I I am. take whatever you say. I am always but not cross The New Times covers a lot of stories that you rough stories. And you they have covered some of these but The New Times covers a lot of these things also. just a essentially. a newspaper. I know the a decent a very smart guy. done a good job. He been with me that long. You know he really came in after the primaries. I had already won the primaries. And if I thought that his views were in that I would immediately let him go. And tell you why. In many respects I think his views are actually on the other side of what a lot of people might think. But you are with all due that and and many folks who disagree with the coverage of and the slant that brings to the news view him that well first of is just a publication. you they cover stories like you cover stories. they are certainly a much more conservative to put it than The New Times. But really is a news organization become quite and got readers and it does cover subjects that are on the but it covers subjects on the left also. I mean a pretty a pretty big thing. And he helped build it into a pretty successful news organization. tell you I know him very well. I will say and I will say if I thought that if I thought that he was doing or had any ideas that were different than the ideas that you would I would ask him very politely to leave. But in the I think been treated very unfairly. very interesting a lot of people are coming to his defense right now. We have never experienced a single episode of any of those accusations. been the total opposite. been a great and just not there. And what the is saying is 100 percent true. And by the if you see something or get something where you feel that and you have some info I would love to hear it. You can call can call I would love to hear. The only one who call me is opinion She treats me too rough. I know what happened to She was so opinion For years she was so good. As we all say about not your just your turn. opinion I have a slightly but somewhat I guess. about the future of the Republican Party. You started out here talking about winning in so many states where no Republican has won in especially Rust Belt states. And I think many people think that one of the reasons you won was that you deliberately campaigned as a different kind of Republican. You had different things to say on foreign even your daughter child care plan was sort of distinctive. And now in a situation where governing and staffing up an administration with a Republican Party whose and may differ with me a little on but always see on those views. Although right now loving me. right now they are. right now loves loves amazing how winning can change things. liked Chuck for a long time. raised a lot of money for Chuck and given him a lot of money over the years. I think I was the first person that ever contributed to Chuck I had a a little in a little apartment building in in Bay where I worked with my father. And Chuck came in and I gave I I know if willing to admit but I believe it was his first campaign But Chuck a good guy. I think get along very well. I guess my question how much do you expect to be able to both run an administration and negotiate with a Congress as a different kind of Republican. And do you worry that wake up three years from now and go back to campaigning in the Rust Belt and people will he governed more like than like Trump. I worry about that. I need to do this. I was telling I need to do this. doing this to do a good what I want to and I think that what happened in the Rust they call it the Rust Belt for a reason. If you go through you look back 20 they used to call it the Rust Belt. You pass factory after factory after factory empty and rusting. Rust is the good worse than falling down. I sacrifice that. To me more important is taking care of the people that really have proven to to love as opposed to the political people. And frankly if the political people take care of these not going to win and going to end up with maybe a total different kind of government than what looking at right now. These people are really angry. and angry. I call them the forgotten men and women. And I use that in I say the forgotten people they were totally forgotten. And going to bring jobs back. going to bring jobs big league. spoken to so many companies I plan on moving your not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product. You think going to just sell it across what will be a strong you know at least going to have a border. But just plan on it. And tell I and hear announcements over the next couple of but I believe talked numerous comp in conversations with top people numerous companies that or potentially leaving our country with thousands of jobs. Are you that those companies will keep their factories but the jobs will be replaced by They and make the robots too. a big make the robots too. Right now we make the robots. We make anything. But going I robotics is becoming very big and going to do that. going to have more factories. We lose 70,000 factories. Just do it. going to start making things. I was honored I got a call from Bill great we had a great I got a call from Cook at and I you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United or many big plants in the United where instead of going to and going to and going to the places that you go making your product right He understand I think create the incentives for and I think going to do it. going for a very large tax cut for which be happy But going for big tax we have to get rid of regulations are making it impossible. Whether liberal or I mean I could sit down and show you regulations that anybody would agree are ridiculous. gotten to be a And companies they even start they choking. I tell one thing I would giving a big tax cut and giving big regulation and seen all of the small business owners over the United and all of the big business met so many people. They are more excited about the regulation cut than about the tax cut. And I never said because the tax going to be substantial. You know we have companies leaving our country because the taxes are too high. But leaving also because of the regulations. And I would of the and I would not have thought regulation substantial regulation are more important and more enthusiastically than even the big tax cuts. I wanted to ask there was a conference this past weekend in of people who pledged their allegiance to you are really into this I think we answered that one right off the bat. Are you going to condemn Of course I of course I did. He already did. Are you going to do it right I maybe you here. Sure. Would you like me to do it do it here. Of course I condemn. I disavow and condemn. go with that. like to move to and then go back. Because a lot of the investment you are talking a lot of the jobs you are talking about is infrastructure going to be the core of your first few not the but an important factor. going for a lot of between between between health care going to talk repeal and replace. health care is you know people are paying a 100 percent increase and not even getting the deductibles are so you have deductibles So paying all of this money and they even get health care. So very important. So there are a lot of things. But is going to be a part of it. part of I even think a big part of it. going to be a big number but I think I am doing things that are more important than but infrastructure is still a part of and talking about a very infrastructure bill. And not a very Republican thing I even know frankly. It worked for Franklin It work for because unfortunately they spend the money last time on infrastructure. They spent it on a lot of other things. You nobody can find out where that last you from a few years ago where that money went. And going to make sure it is spent on infrastructure and roads and highways. I have a a big one of the biggest. And he orders these incredible the I mention the name but a certain truck company that makes they call them the of trucks. You the most expensive trucks. And he calls me up about two months ago and he going to buy the cheapest trucks I can And I and you and this is the biggest guy he trucks are coming going from New to and all busted up. The highways are in such bad hitting hitting He not buying these trucks going to buy the cheapest stuff and the strongest tires I can the exact expression he cheapest trucks and the strongest hitting so many bad you I tell been doing this how 45 years. He built it over 45 years. I you ever seen it like He roads have never been like an interesting What what curious what and said when you going to launch a infrastructure Are they reluctant to spend Honestly right now Trillion. I was the figure. Because they would be in the wing of the Republican Party that would but not going to be able to do that and balance the see if I get it done. Right now in love with me. Four weeks ago they in love with me. forget if I read The New and you have to put this on the record it can be if you you might not want You say but you do I do read it. Unfortunately. I would have lived about 20 years longer if I quote right there if love to reread it I know. But when you look at the all the I was going to lose the I was going to take the House with and the Senate had no chance. It was going to be the biggest humiliation in the history of politics in this country. And instead I won the and I mean easily you look at those I had states where I won by 30 and 40 points. I won the presidency I helped numerous senators in fact the only senators that get elected were two one up in New who refused to say that she was going to vote for who by the way would love a job in the administration and I thank on the record. This is where different than a politician I know what to I just believe sort of interesting. love to have a job in the I thank She refused to vote for me. And a senator in who frankly he endorsed me then he and he went down like a lead balloon. And then they called me before the race and said they wanted me to endorse him and do a big thing and I thank good You see what happens. I off the I hope you lose. Off the record. He He was up by 10 points you know who talking about. others if you look at he was down five points a few days before the he called for I gave him and I think I was up like over 30 points in I was leading by a massive 28 points. I gave him help and he ended up winning by four points or something. I brought a number of them. brought over the finish line. we brought you that was a good one. We brought him over the line in Winning was big something that I came So right now in very good but I came here thinking be awed and overwhelmed by this but I feel like you are getting very comfortable with it. I feel comfortable. I feel comfortable. I am awed by the as anybody would but I I feel so comfortable and you know it would to a great achievement if I could come back here in a year or two years and say and have a lot of the folks here done a great And I mean just a conservative not talking conservative. I mean done a good job. To follow up on after you met with President he described you to folks as that you seemed overwhelmed by what he told you. So I wonder if you are overwhelmed by the magnitude of the job that about to inherit and if you can tell us anything more about that conversation with the president and the apparently subsequent conversations that had on the phone since then. And then maybe talk a little bit about foreign something we touched on and whether or not you believe in the kind of world order a world order led by in terms of having this country underwrite the security and the free markets of the which have been in place for decades. Sure. I had a great meeting with President I never met him before. I really liked him a lot. The meeting was supposed to be 10 15 minutes because there were a lot of people waiting for both of us. And it ended up being you were there I guess an close. And it was a great chemistry. I think if he said I think he meant that in a bad way. I think he meant that it is a very overwhelming job. But not overwhelmed by it. You can do things and fix I think he meant it that way. He said very nice things after the meeting and I said very nice things about him. I really enjoyed my meeting with him. We have you we come from different sides of the but nevertheless something that I know if like him. I probably thought that maybe I but I I did like him. I really enjoyed him a lot. spoken to him since the meeting. What did you say to Just a basic conversation. I think looking to do absolutely the right thing for the country in terms of transition and I telling we had a that went for an hour and a half that could have gone for three or four hours. It was a great it was just a very good meeting. Sort of like this meeting. He told me what he thought what the biggest problems of the country which I think I should I mind if he reveals them. But I was actually surprised a little bit. But he told me the he told me things that he considered but he did tell me what he thought were the biggest in particular one problem that he thought was a big problem for the which rather have you ask him. But I really found the meeting to be very good. And I hope we can have a good I it mean going to agree on but I hope that we will have a great relationship. I really liked him a lot and a little bit surprised telling you that I really liked him a lot. go foreign sure. Sure. What do you see as role in the Do you believe that the role such a big question. The role that we played for 50 years as kind of the global paying more for things because they were in our ultimate one hears from I is really shrinking that role. I think we should be a nation builder. I think tried that. I happen to think that going into was perhaps I mean you could say maybe we could have settled the civil I think going into was one of the great mistakes in the history of our country. I think getting out of it I think we got out of it then lots of bad things including the formation of We could have gotten out of it differently. I think going in was a terrible mistake. we have to solve that problem because we are going to just keep fighting forever. I have a different view on than everybody else. not everybody but then a lot of people. I had to listen to give me a break. I had to listen to Graham talk you attacking and you and like now attacking attacking attacking. And what are we getting and what are we And I have some very I have some very strong ideas on I think happened is a horrible thing. To look at the and not just talking deaths on our which are but the deaths I mean you look at these where massive and they say two people were injured. thousands of people have died. And I think a shame. And ideally we can get do something with I spoke to as you he called essentially How do you see that Essentially everybody called all of the major and most of them spoken to. Will you have a reset with I use that term after what you previously. I think I would love to be able to get along with and I think like to be able to get along with us. in our mutual interest. And I go in with any preconceived but I will tell I would say when they used to during the Trump loves loves I it be say this in front of thousands of it be nice to actually report what they it be nice if we actually got along with it be nice if we went after which by the aside from being very and have been even allowed to and the people will stand up and give me a massive hand. You know they thought it was bad that I was getting along with or that I believe strongly if we can get along with a positive thing. It is a great thing that we can get along with not only but that we get along with other countries. managing On would you you said you have a very strong idea about what to do with the can you describe that for I can only say We have to end that craziness going on in One of the things that was told to me can I say this off the or is everything on the if you want to I want to I want to violate a If you want to go off the we have agreed you can go off the record. Ladies and we are off the record for this moment. speaks off the Now we can go back on. going to play the cop here. got only two and a half minutes because they have a hard stop at 2. And by the I want to thank you on behalf of all of us Thank you. for this and really I mean that. We are back on the record. you get the last question. Is he a tough Is he I have two very quickly. One is your vice left open the idea of returning to You talked about that on the campaign trail. hoping you can talk about how you view torture at this and also what are you hoping that will do in your administration and will you bring him in I hear the second question. What will role be in your Oh. Maybe nothing. Because I want to have people saying Even though the president of the United States I hope whoever is writing this written fairly the president of the United States is allowed to have whatever conflicts he wants he or she wants. But I want to go by that. a very smart guy. a very good guy. The people that know a quality person and I think he can be very helpful. I would love to be able to be the one that made peace with and the I would love that would be such a great achievement. Because been able to do it. Do you think he can be part of I think be very good at it. I mean he knows it so well. He knows the knows the knows the players. I would love to be and you can put that down in a list of many things that like to be able to do. Now a lot of people tell really great people tell that you do it. had a lot great businesspeople tell you do impossible. I I think you can make peace. I think people are tired now of being killed. At some when do they I think we can do that. I have reason to believe I can do that. And on Where are you and I met with General who is a very respected guy. In I met with a number of other they say the finest there is. He is being seriously considered for secretary of which is I think time time for a general. Look at going on. We we beat we win anymore. At anything. We win on the we win with we certainly win with the military. General is a highly dignified man. I met with him at length and I asked him that question. I what do you think of He said I was surprised he never found it to be He always give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with And I was very impressed by that answer. I was because known as being like the toughest guy. And when he said not saying it changed my mind. we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and not allowed to But tell you I was impressed by that answer. It certainly does not not going to make the kind of a difference that maybe a lot of people think. If so important to the I would go for it. I would be guided by that. But General found it to be very less much less important than I thought he would say. I thought he would say you know known as Mad Dog Mad Dog for a reason. I thought say lose He actually give me some cigarettes and some and do with going to go to our Mark for the last question. Very powerful man MARK Thank and a really short but after all the talk about libel and libel are you committed to the First Amendment to the I was hoping he going to say that. I think be happy. I think be happy. somebody said to me on they a great softening up those but you may get sued a lot I I never thought about I I have to start thinking about I think be I think going to be fine. thank you very much for this. Really appreciate this. Thank you very a great honor. I will The Times a great jewel. A world jewel. And I hope we can all get along. looking for the same and I hope we can all get along well.

Apple and other devices have long had an airplane mode that shuts off wireless communications to prevent interference with the vast electronics systems that control modern aircraft. Now federal auto safety regulators want makers of these devices to add a driver mode to modify or block certain and features to keep a attention on the road. The initiative comes in the form of voluntary guidelines that will be issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They arrive amid a spike in traffic fatalities in the last two years and increasing concerns about the distractions posed by and the many that are using while behind the wheel. becomes so many different things that not just a communication secretary of the Transportation said in an interview. is still a problem. Too many people are dying and being injured on our The guidelines call on electronics manufacturers like Apple and to design future operating systems that limit the functionality and simplify interfaces while a vehicle is in motion and to develop technology to identify when the devices are being used by a driver while driving. That would ensure the limits are placed on drivers and not other vehicle occupants. The new guidelines from are the first recommendations specifically for portable devices that are used while driving. The agency cannot force electronics companies to but in the past it issued a set of guidelines for the navigation and entertainment systems built into cars by the manufacturer and adopted for the most part. The airplane mode has been around about as long as The Federal Aviation Administration had required turning off electronics before but that rule was relaxed to allow the use of in flight as long as they had their communications shut off. That led to airplane which the had in 2007. there are varying degrees of recognition in the tech community that when building an or a or contemplating a strong possibility that someone could be trying to use that in the said. In the first six months of highway deaths increased 10.4 to according to preliminary data compiled by At that more than 100 people die every day in traffic accidents. In traffic fatalities rose 7.1 it was the largest annual percentage increase in traffic deaths in 50 years. Part of the increase in road deaths can be explained by the improving higher employment numbers and low gasoline all of which are causing to drive more than they did just a few years during the depths of the recession. In an interview in Mark the said the increase in miles traveled was not enough by itself to explain this spike in injuries and deaths. fatalities are occurring more frequently even when the increased travel is factored in. and other safety experts think one factor is distracted driving.

Many of the most skilled workers young people with college degrees are leaving struggling regions of for specifically for cities in Southern and coastal states. There are clear economic reasons for their choice. Dense metro areas tend to produce more jobs and make workers more productive. for all kinds of are also higher. In these incentives should prompt workers of all levels of education to move to metro areas. But moving outside region is relatively rare these and even more rare for someone without a college degree. Moving is actually quite uncommon in advanced economies. The United States has been one of the exceptions. It has one of the highest rates of internal migration among advanced and it has since at least the middle of the 19th century. A study comparing thousands of and census records between 1850 and 1880 showed that nearly of men moved across county while only a quarter of men did. For first internal migration was largely driven by farming moving west to new land. But toward the end of the 19th and in the early 20th migration began to be driven by people moving to cities small and large. This pattern added a twist after World War when more people began moving outside their local particularly to the Before the roughly 15 percent of lived outside a census division in which they were and by 1970 that had jumped to 25 percent. But in the people started moving less. Internal migration has been in gradual decline ever since across all demographic groups. In the 3 percent of men moved across state lines each over the last decade that figure has dropped to 1.7 percent. The decline is similar for women. Between 2001 and the demographic groups with the lowest rate of interstate migration were people with less than a high school diploma or nothing beyond a high school diploma Migration rates for people were roughly twice that.

Although they have some large they tend to be farther from other large cities than is the case in the coastal areas.

THANK YOU FOR BEING Guide to Thriving in the Age of L. pp. From Trump to to Marine one thing that unites the unhappy West is a profound sense of mystification. Across and North people have an acute feeling that their world is accelerating away from them but they quite understand why. There is no narrative. Hence the attraction of leaders who it like it and identify convenient like immigrants or the Union. But what most people really crave is an honest explanation. As with patients on a the first step is to understand what is going wrong. Then you can decide on the medication. Into this darkened room steps Tom While other journalists dream of being investigative reporters or news L. is a whose goal is to be a from to And he is extremely good at it. A talent for explanation has garnered him a column at The New Times and a string of books on huge subjects like and climate change. Snooty critics might grumble about his folksy but it is hard to think of any other journalist who has explained as many complicated subjects to so many people. Now he has written his most ambitious book part personal part manifesto. You for Being has two overt aims. wants to explain why the world is the way it is why so many things seem to be spinning out of especially for the white middle class he grew up in. And then he wants to reassure us that it is basically going to be In general the explanation is more convincing than the reassurance. But as a guide for perplexed this book is very hard to beat. argues that man is actually a fairly adaptable creature. The problem is that our capacity to adapt is being outpaced by a built from three ever faster the market and climate change. That sounds like a predictable but digs cleverly into each one. For on technology he argues convincingly that which saw the arrival of the Android and was the year when software in the words of the he introduces us to vital obscure like and he points out that if law the power of microchips would double about every two had applied to the capabilities of not computer then the modern descendant of the 1971 Beetle would travel at 300,000 miles per cost 4 cents and use one tank of gasoline in a lifetime. The chapters on climate change and the market are stuffed with similar nuggets. But also shows how all three forces complicating and speeding up one another. In climate change is wrecking crops even as technology is helping more children so a population of 19 million will reach 72 million hungry people by 2050. On trading technology and markets create so a operating out of his flat by can make the index fall 9 percent in a And will keep getting faster. There are already at least 10 billion things connected to the but that is still less than 1 percent of the possible total as ever more gadgets and bodies join of Man has sped up his own response times. It now takes us only 10-15 years to get used to the sort of technological changes that we used to absorb in a couple of but what good is that when technology becomes obsolete every five to seven The supernova is making a joke of both patent law and education. companies and individuals are all struggling to keep up.

In two and a half years researching this he had to interview all the main technologists at least because things changed so quickly. Like everybody he has no time to The title comes from an offhand comment to a friend whose tardiness allowed a few welcome minutes of contemplation. For the most You for Being is a master class in explaining. It canters along at a pace that is quick enough to permit learning without getting bogged down. Inevitably he sometimes gets the balance either allowing his informants to ramble or skating over a thorny For having admitted that productivity numbers have not forward in the same way that technology he asks in to trust they will. the folksiness will still irk some The starting point for the book is a chat with a parking with another attendant from waiting near the end. But criticizing for humanizing and boiling down big topics is like complaining that used sex to sell It is what he does well. There is also a value in bringing things together in putting foreign policy beside climate change. And be fooled by the catchy slogans not into and so As usual with it is all backed up by pages of serious reporting from around the world. this complaint is that the explaining is too convincing.

This is perhaps the most memorable part of the book a piece of sustained reportage that ranks alongside to masterly first book about the Middle East. He points out that the same communal virtues that made work when he was young have survived and are still useful. But the passages that lingered with this reader were the ones about the good old days that have disappeared when baseball used to be a sport that everybody could afford to when local boys like the young could caddy at the United States when everybody in town went to public schools. So you finish this book thinking everything is going to be for the unhappy West that can dance in a There is no easy pill to and most of the ones being proffered by the extremists are poison. But after your session with you have a much better idea of the forces that are upending your how they work together and what companies and governments can do to prosper.

But Vine links could be shared independent of the and people did so with meaning that Vines appeared around the defying the sorting mechanism of streams and feeds.

New features are introduced it to make messaging with your friends more The latest version of the software includes the ability to make messages with confetti. now offers the ability to tag people in as you might tag them in a photograph These changes have probably been spurred by messaging applications which used similar features to attract and retain customers. a company that built an addictive messaging with 220 million monthly users had one of the biggest initial public offerings billion earlier this These new messaging features work to bind private groups tighter by making it more fun to talk to one another than to engage with the world at large.

But that make central idea any less that libel law can be a tool of revenge. disconcerting for a maybe not as rich as he plaintiff to treat the legal system as a weapon to be deployed against critics. Once installed in the White Trump will have a wider array of tools at his and his record suggests more than his he will try to use the press and also control and subdue it. As a Trump blustered vaguely that he wanted to up our libel I asked his Hope by email what he meant by but she answer the question others I not within the direct powers to change the rules for libel suits. But our legal safeguards for writers and publishers foolproof. In the last few Trump has been joined by at least two billionaires who are determined to exploit cracks in the wall of defense around the press. The members of this club are innovators. They have sued or funded suits to defend reputations or protect privacy. But an underlying aim appears to be to punish critics like or even destroy entire media outlets. This kind of manipulation of the law is unfolding at a keen moment of weakness for the which has already been buffeted by falling revenue and mounting public disaffection. Only 40 percent of the public the lowest rate since at least the trusts the media report the news accurately and according to a survey conducted in 2015. This mistrust has been growing for a long but it was stoked by Trump during the campaign. He called the reporters who covered him and whipped up yelling and booing crowds. There is no consensus among his supporters that the press should hold those in power accountable. A recent Pew survey found that only half of Trump backers agreed that it was important in a strong democracy that organizations are free to criticize political Media outlets have won many cases by persuading a judge to dismiss them. But since they have succeeded in only 39 percent of the libel and privacy suits that have gone to a dip from 52 percent in the previous according to the Media Law Resource Center. The median damage award has increased fivefold since the to million. The figure includes three big verdicts over the last eight against Rolling Stone and The News Observer in These include libel and too early to say that the sky is falling on the press. But darkening. The high bar for winning a libel case in the United States was set in when the Supreme Court decided New Times v. In that widely hailed as one of the strongest stands for free a city commissioner who supervised the police in sued The Times over an ad in the newspaper signed by 100 civil rights supporters.

Under the rules at the a libel plaintiff was entitled to victory if he could show that the content that harmed his reputation was false. The jury agreed with on that point and awarded him in damages equivalent of about million With similar cases The Times pulled its reporters out of But when the newspaper appealed to the Supreme the justices threw out the verdict and set a far stiffer standard for proving libel. The court wrote that a public figure has to prove that a false and damaging statement about him was published with translated as or reckless disregard for the By the the number of libel suits and if suits did go to they frequently ended in defeat for the plaintiff.

It she the first negative feedback she had received from her fellow partners. A feeling of loss stuck with her after her she said. The lawyer said that she had to start her career taking a job that was more junior and at lower pay. She agreed to tell her story on the condition that she and her former firm not be fearing that her professional reputation and livelihood would be seriously harmed as a result. Not all lawyers leave. The number of partners at the 200 largest law firms in the country has more than tripled to an average of 117 per firm in 2014 from an average of just 35 in said D. a principal at a legal consulting firm. And not all partners are the result of reductions in rank. Some lawyers choose it so they do not have to invest capital in the firm typically in the hundreds of thousands of dollars or risk partnership liability if someone sues the firm. And more appear to settle for it as the top level of their career. In partners made up slightly more than 40 percent of all partners at premier up from 17 percent a decade and a half ago. This 22 percent of the 93,000 lawyers in the top 100 firms are equity compared with 35 percent in 1996. Those who have reached the top at least at big law work more hours than their according to figures from Private Law Firm Group. Last ownership partners worked an average of 87 hours annually more than partners up from 64 hours more five years according to a sample of 40 of the largest 50 firms. Putting colleagues out on the or even packing them off to a smaller is not easy. And firms are loath to draw attention to such moves for fear of damaging their prestige and their ability to attract new business. too many according to a study by political and cultural obstacles are hindering pragmatic economic including ousting lawyers who are not needed or not attracting lucrative legal work. the winnowing of partners who can take home hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in annual compensation is taking place more frequently.

The State has used chemical including chlorine and sulfur mustard at least 52 times on the battlefield in and since it swept to power in according to a new independent analysis. More than of those chemical attacks have come in and around the State stronghold in northern according to the assessment by the Conflict a intelligence collection and analysis service. The which are based on local news social media and State mark the broadest compilation of chemical attacks in the conflict. and military officials have expressed growing alarm over the prospect of additional chemical attacks as the allies press to regain both and the State capital in coalition is concerned about use of chemical Col.

The effects of these chemical munitions thus far have been limited to the immediate area where they land. The assessment is to be made public on The New Times obtained an advance copy of the assessment and the location of the 52 reported chemical attacks. The analysis did not break down the cases by type of chemical attack. In an effort to blunt the ability to make the the air campaign has bombed militants associated with overseeing their production and the facilities where chemical ordnance is manufactured.

The chemical agents are worrisome as potential terrorist even though chlorine and blister agents are typically less lethal than shrapnel or explosives. It was unclear how the State had obtained sulfur a banned substance with a narrow chemical warfare application. Both the former government in and the current government in at one point possessed chemical warfare programs. Chlorine is commercially available as an industrial chemical and has been used occasionally by bomb makers from militant groups in for about a decade. But it is not known how the State would have obtained sulfur the officials said. Abandoned and aging chemical munitions produced by during its war against in the were used in roadside bombs against forces during the occupation that followed the 2003 invasion of But officials have said the types of ordnance that have been publicly disclosed so far have not matched known chemical ordnance in the former inventory. The attacks have been geographically scattered and have varied in their delivery suggesting that the State had access and was experimenting different types of rockets and shells configured to carry chemical warfare agents or toxic industrial chemicals. One theory is that the militants were manufacturing a crude mustard agent officials say. Another theory is that the State acquired sulfur mustard from undeclared stocks in either through capture or by purchasing it from corrupt although this theory is not widely held by analysts.

Pharmaceuticals International is a onetime Wall Street darling that has become a punching bag for how pharmaceutical firms drove up drug prices and engaged in questionable sales in the process losing 90 percent of its market value. The first case to emerge from multiple federal and state investigations of its portrays it as a not a perpetrator. The Justice Department charged a former with taking about million in kickbacks from the chief executive of a specialty while hiding his true intentions from corporate management. had a relationship with and in 2014 paid million on an option to buy but it dropped the association last year. shut down in The criminal complaint depicts surreptitious payments and a cavalier highlighted by an email from Davenport to Tanner evoking how the two men would be like Butch and the Kid and into the sunset off the cliff as in the The case appears to be a straightforward tale of but there may be more to proving the charges than meets the perhaps portending a more difficult prosecution for the Justice Department. Was really the or was it a willing participant that wanted to build up so it could increase sales of its lawyer issued a statement asserting that his client did his job greatly benefiting and regularly communicated to his superiors what he was lawyer took a similar claiming that also benefited which is why and its highly sophisticated and active management team sought to buy job was to develop what was called the alternative fulfillment in which sought to have prescriptions filled with the drugs through specialty pharmacies like rather than with cheaper generics. In that Tanner was and helped the company increase its sales. But executives also wanted to develop other outlets for its which Tanner is accused of resisting. The criminal complaint portrays Tanner as a classic unfaithful servant who made a key outlet for drugs while working out a secret agreement with Davenport to get a cut of his profits. He is accused of pushing to enter into an option agreement to acquire the mail order pharmacy while denying to his superiors that he had any financial interest in Tanner received about million of payments to money funneled through corporate bank accounts to a shell company controlled by Tanner. If they were trying to hide those the two defendants certainly did a poor job by using an account over which Tanner had signature which would be easy to and keeping the money in the United States rather than shifting it to an offshore account. At one the Justice Department could bring a case against an employee for breaching a fiduciary duty to the employer as mail or wire fraud for violating the right of honest services statute. But the Supreme decision in Skilling v. United States in 2010 restricted this type of fraud to cases involving payment of a bribe or kickback to the not just unethical conduct that deceived an employer. Figuring out whether the million constituted a kickback to Tanner is the prerequisite to proving that he committed honest services fraud. A federal statute cited in the Skilling case defines a kickback as a benefit given improperly obtain or reward favorable treatment in connection a transaction. Whether the dealings with were will be the crux of the case against the defendants. The criminal complaint goes to great lengths to describe how Tanner kept senior executives in the dark about his role at and the benefits he would receive. He also made sure that played a crucial role in the alternative fulfillment program by never pursuing relationships with other potential pharmacy partners. Buying turned out to be problematic for when the company had to issue an accounting restatement after finding that it had incorrectly recorded million in sales to the pharmacy. And after questions were raised about whether it properly disclosed the relationship with in its filings with the Securities and Exchange shut down the unit. But that does not necessarily mean that the relationship was or that the million Tanner received constituted an illegal kickback. was aware of how the mail order pharmacy and the role it played in growing pharmaceutical a key to Wall embrace of the company that took the stock to more than per share in 2015. The New Times described an view that benefited significantly from its ties to the allowing it to increase sales of ailing products and obscure more significant problems with the Unlike the typical kickback scheme in which a supplier pays an official to award a contract that should not have been the defendants can argue that the development of was a benefit to and the option to buy it was arranged by experienced executives who paid no more than what they thought the mail order pharmacy was worth at the time. A decision in 2016 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in in United States v. may offer a path for Tanner to argue that not revealing his interest in the deal does not constitute fraud. In that the conviction of a bank officer who negotiated a sale of the interest in a development while secretly taking an ownership interest in the property was overturned. The appeals court found negotiating and certainly the sophisticated businessmen in this do not expect complete candor about negotiating as distinct from facts and promises of future stake in the deal may not have tainted the transaction even if he breached a fiduciary duty to by not disclosing any arrangement he had with Davenport. Unlike the typical he can argue that his share of the deal was a means to bring both sides together in a mutually beneficial arrangement. was not so much a victim of a bad deal as a willing participant that received the benefit that it sought by gaining control of an important conduit to sell its drugs and avoid losing sales to generics. That argument would not put a seal of approval on what Tanner and arranging to make almost million off a deal without first disclosing it to your employer is likely to be considered a breach of duty if sued him. But whether the federal fraud statutes should be used to police a dispute about a private employment relationship is a different especially when the defendants face a potential sentence of up to 20 years in prison if convicted of the fraud charge.

Admiral replacement would not be confirmed until after Trump takes over. One senior intelligence official argued that letting word of the effort leak seemed more about politics or vengeance than about effecting any real change. Representative of the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a member of transition strongly defended Admiral Rogers.

The number of complaints coming into the public office is five times the normal and the pace has only just recently tapered off.

They have a variety of including the election coverage. Last J. Trump jumped tweeting that The Times had lost thousands of subscribers since the election. The paper says quite the opposite is the It reports having the largest subscription increase since the first week of the digital pay in 2011. I assume that The Times has more accurate data than Trump. But I hope any chest thumping about the impressive subscriber bump obscure a look at coverage. Because from my conversations with and from the emails that have come into my I can tell you there is a searing level of dissatisfaction out there with many aspects of the coverage. Readers complain heatedly and repeatedly about the forecasting odometer from The Upshot that was anchored on the home page and predicted that had an 80 percent chance or better of winning. They complain that The attempt to tap the sentiments of Trump supporters was lacking. And they complain about the liberal tint The Times applies to its without awareness that it does. Few could deny that if more moderate supporters are feeling bruised right the blame lies partly with their candidate and his penchant for inflammatory rhetoric. But the media is at fault for turning his remarks into a grim caricature that it applied to those who backed him. What struck me is how many liberal voters I spoke with felt too.

As soon as the authorities will announce a roughly million settlement with the bank and its Hong according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The which include criminal prosecutors and civil will accuse the bank of orchestrating a foreign bribery scheme. When The New Times reported on the contours of a settlement in it was not known whether the authorities would explicitly accuse the bank of carrying out a quid pro quo providing jobs in exchange for lucrative assignments from companies. This which strikes at the heart of whether violated United States law governing foreign became a focal point of the investigation and the ensuing settlement negotiations. The bank argued that the hiring of employees was routine in and that its own hires fell into a gray area of foreign bribery laws. The United States concluded that in several senior bankers explicitly linked those jobs or internships to securing deals with the people briefed on the matter said. the people formalized the hiring into what it called the Sons and Daughters program. The bank even went so far as to create spreadsheets that tracked its hires to specific clients and the ability to convert these hires into business deals.

That effort garnered settlements and splashy but no criminal prosecutions of top Wall Street executives after the financial crisis an absence that has drawn much criticism and public debate.

The United States office in and the Justice criminal division in are expected to impose a roughly million penalty on the bank but will not charge any of the bankers who doled out the jobs.

The White House confirmed in a statement on that eight days before the presidential the United States the government directly regarding malicious that was state It sent the message over a rarely used a connecting the Nuclear Risk Reduction Centers in both which they had agreed three years ago could also be employed to deal with major The warning only the latest after verbal cautions by President his defense secretary and the director of national intelligence was reported by The Post.

But for now the situation underscores the uncertainty around the world about the direction of foreign policy and gives the opportunity to exploit differences between the current president and his successor until Trump is inaugurated on 20. It is also raising the question of whether the White House pushed back hard enough when intelligence agencies concluded on 7 that officials could have authorized these A. a computer expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in dismissed the claim that it had deterred hacking. seems a little bold to claim this is a success for since the deterred from doing he said. hacking work was mostly complete.

When conducted a mass hanging in August of prisoners accused of attacks in its restive western the executions were widely criticized as an egregious human rights violation. But opponents also were appalled at what came next. Videos that showed apparently coerced confessions of the prisoners interwoven with music and clips of unrelated assaults by militants of the State have been shown on state television in the months since the executions. Produced and disseminated by official media the videos contain no apologies for the mass hangings. They apparently are meant to exploit fears among the majority population about the the extremist group ensconced in and that shares antipathy for both and the West. Human rights groups say the hangings in on 2 put 20 to 25 prisoners to one of the largest mass executions ever carried out in that country.

These doctors negotiate separate deals with insurance companies for payment. If the doctor and the insurance company never strike a the visit is billed at much higher rates. While the insurance company sometimes pays the higher unlucky patients like can be caught in the crossfire. They receive care and have no idea what it will end up costing them. New research published in The New England Journal of Medicine on found that more than one in five patients visiting the emergency room may face the same financial shock. The study looked at billing data from one large national insurer and found that 22 percent of the patients who went to a hospital covered by their plan still received a bill from a doctor who was not in the insurance network. The average such bill cost more than though there was a wide the highest was for more than This is not the first time researchers have examined surprise medical but the broadest analysis to date of the problem nationwide. The study found wide variation across the country over the likelihood that someone would get a surprise medical bill. In for the rates of surprise billing were 89 compared with where it was near zero. Once patients get to the emergency they have little choice over who treats them. put it in very blunt This is the health equivalent of a said an assistant professor of health policy and economics at and a of the paper. Cooper argues that the problem could be solved by which could make the visit a package that includes both the doctor and hospital. Consumer and scholars like see the surprise bill as unfair. nearly impossible for patients to uncover the contract arrangements of individual physicians once they walk into an emergency room or are brought by ambulance. by and not aware that playing that type of financial said Chuck the programs director at Consumers an advocacy group that has been urging states and Congress to help solve the problem. follow the and they go to the and then just like a Several states have passed legislation aimed at tackling the including New and where a law recently went into effect. But the state laws affect only a fraction of insurance customers. Insurance offered by large like is regulated under federal law. And most of the laws work by setting up a dispute resolution system for which means they need to know they can go to state authorities to fight a big bill. Congressman a Democrat from introduced legislation last year to tackle the practice but he said he experienced healthy dose of from his colleagues on the Ways and Means committee. had heard complaints of surprise bills from and it turns out that the new study found that is a hot spot for the practice. said he would introduce the legislation again next year. think that got to be a way to get consumers out of this he said. President included proposals to limit emergency room bills in his budget and recent regulations have made it more difficult for doctors to collect certain though those rules are being fought in court by physicians. The acting administrator for the Centers for and Services has said that surprise bills are a policy priority for him. The data in the study come from one large commercial but the researchers agreed not to name it in exchange for access. Cooper said there was only a little difference in the share of surprise bills in places where the insurance company had a lot of compared with those where it did less business. Emergency room doctors criticized the findings and were quick to blame the insurers. The College of Emergency the medical society that represents the said patients are much less likely to face large unexpected bills than the study citing an analysis the group did in of patients who were or asked to make up the difference between what the insurer pays and what the doctor bills. balance bills are less than a couple of hundred on said the president.

Insurance companies like to blame the arguing that while they can reach a deal with the there are many doctors who refuse to be part of the network they offer under a plan.

From the the central enigma was J. Trump. How did this celebrity tycoon with no political experience get so Who were the supporting him and When I started my unusual assignment of covering the presidential campaign from the perspective of a foreign correspondent for an news organization one of the first things I did was to invite questions from international readers. The bulk of them revolved around whose unorthodox romp through the Republican primaries propelled him to the nomination and ultimately to the presidency. Going back through my journey across there were many clues to rising although not all were easy to read. I drank with Trump supporters in bars and casinos. I approached them at rodeos. I chatted with them at gun clubs and diners and roaring political rallies. The broad topography of Trump country in many easy to trace. It is a place of anger and gripped by a feverish sentiment. People wanted change and a chance to raise a throbbing finger to the forces they blame for their lot in life. Yet other factors were at in this unruly factors that sometimes made it hard to see talk social media bubbles and a simmering culture war separating thriving coastal areas and the wounded interior of the country. It always clear which elements were powering the as the movement called and which were being buoyed along. One of my first stops was a decimated coal town in West It had a sports which offered beer for on and a biker bar it was patrons sometimes squealed tires inside until the room filled with smoke. Both were filled with Trump little surprise since he had promised to reopen coal mines shuttered by the environmental regulations and cheap natural gas. In I also saw how message about change was overshadowing other issues that many analysts thought would have disqualified him from winning over the social conservatives who have long been a core Republican constituency. In conversations after church on many glossed over the three marriages and boasts of his battle with sexually transmitted disease. like Trump told Stern in It was hard to but perhaps that was the that a mysterious alchemy was at work in this one in which outrageous might offer a route to success. Around that Apple released its seventh iteration of the that glossy black totem of progress. Inscribed on the back of every are the words in Assembled in As if is a separate country. And how many in Trump country saw it that instead of being part of the they were living in a land that sent jobs overseas. One thing that like many and other had long seen as distinguishing the United States was its restless optimism and innate traded on pessimism. His Great embodied a vision that aimed to restore pride in the military and but also scapegoated minorities and At most of the faces in the crowd were white. People flew Confederate flags. They spoke impatiently about prejudice toward was openly a factory owner in told me that children in which has the largest percentage of had stayed home from school in droves on Sept. 11 because they had secretly received advanced warnings of the attacks. The atmosphere at Trump rallies was permissive. If someone said something offensive or there was little fear of being hushed or contradicted. Yet in another confounding a significant minority of Trump supporters were minorities themselves. I met people who defied neat a black woman in her who worked at a record label in a driver in Las a doorman in At a rally in the final week in a Rust Belt state that would prove central to I saw how the candidate connected with crowd. When he it was if he held an invisible tuning fork held to his listening for the smallest murmur of which he would seize upon and amplify. It reminded me of powerful preachers and populist politicians seen during my years based in What was hard to know was how far the electric energy inside this hall was radiating. Maybe these were just the loyalists. polls suggested that Trump was behind in many places critical to Electoral College victory. Political including dismissed the notion that Trump could win mainly by consolidating the support of white voters. like the hunt for the lost tribes of the was how a consultant who had worked for the 2012 Republican Mitt put it early on. you paddle your canoe far enough up the and bang your drum hard they will come to the riverbank. But just not But when I mentioned the polls showing Trump lagging to his they snorted derisively. Everyone they knew was voting Trump children. Some were former Democrats. Others were people who voted for decades. The they were either asking the wrong questions or were being manipulated by the news media the polls themselves were part of the system these people were trying to overthrow. At the I discounted the conspiratorial talk as a product of the echo chamber that became so powerful in this election. But in broad the Trump supporters were right in key their votes were by pollsters. The winning margin in many like was and the failure of Democrats to mobilize turnout was also a major factor. the driver who took me from a Trump rally to the was a case in he was an a registered and he did not intend to vote. of them look any good to he said. benefited also from the antipathy so many people felt toward his This was another theme in the questions that poured in from international Why did so many seem to hate her so The answer had many Fatigue from her decades in public unfinished business from her time in power in the distaste for how she had handled his sexual outrage over her use of a private email server while secretary of state and her taking in huge sums for speeches to Wall Street unfiltered sexism.

In while I was visiting my one of his friends offered an explanation. like getting socks for again he said. bloody socks. Nobody wants a present like in the found the of white voters. They heard his and voted as a bloc like never before. stunning victory echoes jolting changes in and other countries where a new brand of politics is resurgent. The question of whether it stemmed from a specific constellation of or represented a more fundamental may now be answered under the Trump presidency.

In the week since J. election as president of the United much has been written about the potential conflicts of interest a sitting president with a global business may encounter other Less has been paid to the even fuzzier situation of the close family members of a sitting and their business interests though on it became clear that this is another potential at least when it comes to the first daughter Trump and a brand that is largely built on her image. A group of including reporters at The New Times and received an email from Trump Fine the upscale brand Ms. Trump founded in entitled and touting Trump wearing her favorite bangle from the Metropolis Collection on The a bracelet that costs on her was clearly pictured on her wrist during her interview with her stepmother and grown siblings with on night. Such emails are not uncommon among fashion which tend to trumpet every celebrity sighting in their products to the world at large. What was different about this was that it came not from the communications but from the vice president for the person in a brand who would generally work with a wholesale partners Ms. stores such as in and and Son in And that after pointing out the it urged recipients to share this with your In other it used Ms. appearance by her side to directly promote the selling of her products.

In Ms. Trump wore a dress from her own collection to introduce her father at the Republican National Convention also wore her own brand shoes and The next her company tweeted out a picture of her from the podium with the words look from her and a link to the where a similar style from the brand was offered. The dress reportedly sold out in a day. At the the decision was met with some even though the stakes were lower. Trump has stated that his children will have no formal roles in his White because they will be running his and there is no law that prohibits presidential relatives from continuing their own though Section 713 of Title 18 of the United States Code forbids the use of likenesses of the presidential seal for promotional purposes. Ms. Trump has not come close to but the appearance is still ethically blurred. Whether or not Ms. Trump knew of the bracelet email before it was her name is still on the top of the alert. In the attempts by relatives to profit from a connection to a such as Billy introduction of Billy Beer during his brother and the creation of Roger during his half brother terms in were roundly deemed inappropriate. The tension between Ms. position on her transition team and her but role as a representative of women and the younger generation in his and the fact that she is her own best ad and her brand is thus understandably using her as a makes the issue even more and it underscores her status in the public eye and the amount of attention she will incur.

So just when we thought that 2016 get any more it with a Trump victory. I told you last week that strange happenings were afoot in the what with the Cubs winning the World Series and all. I hear that New Yorkers are taking it pretty hard. Are people stocking up on canned Greetings from the Land of Duck and Not sure quite sunk in. But foods and subterranean real estate are in demand. and sounds like a hunting club. So where shall we a little weary of the conversations. get right to what do you think will happen Trump will set up an administration. The sun will rise in the east. My dog will chase squirrels. The world will go on. Glad to hear taking it well. He stayed cautiously neutral in the but a very good boy. I think you once made the point to me that there are no permanent victories or defeats in politics. So perhaps a good place to start a conversation about the future. been since I came to at the collective failure to understand that point. It is patently true upon the most cursory inspection of recent history. In Democrats were popping Champagne over the dawn of a permanent era of progressive politics. Now they see most of their dreams being unraveled. And Republicans celebrating today will sooner or later be miserable. I made a Things are looking better already. Both winners and losers who ignore this reality make silly unforced errors. The losers err on the side of excessive like the classic threats to leave the country. Reader email has informed me way harder to leave the country than one might think. We in all that much demand. And the winners fail when they convince themselves that since victory is they can set an agenda that attracts no one from the other side. looking at a President Trump and a House and say we are in for a stretch of dumb things. Presidents generally get most of their big changes done in the first year or two. President did that with health care. His agenda was nothing compared to W. who did everything from tax cuts to getting authorization for the invasion. But was certainly a big lift. It was also a central campaign promise. I know you think it was a bad idea. I think that strategy is enormously shortsighted. I remember thinking when the Democrats held the White House and both houses of Congress in though they have it might be wise to give a little to bring some centrist Republicans into Some day the Republicans might be in a position to reverse everything if they have zero political investment in And sure here we are. My point is that of course a president should have a vision that matches his ideology. why he got elected. But I think it is impractical and imprudent to forgive me for another reference to Is Spinal turn it up to 11. Give on a few things where you have because someday going to need friends to protect the stuff you care about most. The Trump administration might learn from the outgoing horror at seeing some or all of repealed. We part company here. My perception of was of a Democratic Party willing to work on compromise legislation while the Republicans just stalled. There was no unified Republican just a ton of people who wanted to be but kept changing their mind. But the bottom line is that left behind the old Congress. now got guys who sleep in their offices and even talk to the other side at the House gym. Secretly a lot of them are actually but I take your point. And another recommendation I would make to President Make friends everyplace. That was the magic. golf with the same people every week. Since I have no prepared to look on the bright side for a while. The Republican hatred of is so great that even if had gotten elected it would have been really hard to get the necessary fixes through Congress. Trump has promised and as of his interview something better that preserves the most popular parts of the program. So see what he comes up with. I know a big fan. His agenda and agenda really do Congress is set to have a big influence on the agenda over the next and and Trump will figure out how to make their ideas jibe. plan includes a health care replacement plan for It will actually do some of the things liberals really like getting more people covered. I realize that very disappointing for progressives to see but not like it will be replaced by nothing. This is one area where the product usually resemble the recipe. I remember presidential candidate saying all health care negotiations could take place in on Grab your crystal ball and give me a couple of other predictions. seeing a big tax cut and huge spending on infrastructure repair. Followed by a stupendous rise in the national debt. certainly true that neither party has been great at getting the deficit under control in my lifetime. Nobody calls his or her congressman and just do sit Only one side adds to the deficit while simultaneously complaining too big. But move on. obviously cranky. How Any other How about the early The Republican establishment seems to have as White House chief of staff. But is going to be chief strategist. Which could mean anything. To me is the kind of guy Democrats should learn to live with they and going to be a Republican White House. But is a very bad dude who represents all the worst strands of racism and misogyny in the Trump crowd. Who do you think will really have the It looks like both will be influential. After watching the I find pair of appointments too surprising. They signal that in as during his Trump will seek to merge traditional Republican politics with his unconventional brand of populism. And what about It seems now the wall may be a and the deportees will be only criminals. has been trying to deport undocumented immigrants who break the law for years. see where the big switch is. I think given what heard so far. In that Trump said that securing the southern border will probably involve a mixture of wall and and that he plans to limit deportations to illegal immigrants who have committed crimes. Those steps would not require the kind of massive deportation force that some predicted and feared. been thinking a lot about the source of strength rural areas and declining small cities. you always told me that one of our problems is that have stopped moving to where the jobs Apparently right and prefer to stay be angry and elect Trump president. one interpretation. Another is that people simply have the skills for the promising jobs that would require a especially since we stopped teaching vocational and technical skills. So they stay put. I find this the more compelling view. I always prefer the explanation that just boil down a move I have three so I confess to using that approach sometimes. As to how all this affected my colleague Nick published a wonderful book earlier this year called Without It shows the collapse of employment among men over the past 50 years. This got much worse in the wake of the Great Recession and the disappointing most of which yielded no income growth for the entire bottom 80 percent of the income distribution. In other the economic recovery was only really salient for the richest fifth of the population. Important which I plan to reiterate regularly when Trump begins his economic program by reducing taxes for the rich and regulations on the banks. The problem just material especially given the expansion of welfare benefits. the loss of dignity that comes from not creating value through honest work. For neither party has addressed this dignity crisis for men without a college education. an obvious connection here with the explosion of suicide and opiate abuse in rural I think all pretty clear today that a cry of rage from white And Trump was pretty good on the end. But beyond a huge infrastructure repair plan which was actually clearer on I heard a whole lot of solutions. When Trump talked about kicking out illegal immigrants and canceling experts scoffed at the unworkability and undesirability of the specific proposals. But I talked to tons of people supporting Trump who basically know if that stuff will work. But finally a guy who at least is saying try something to bring back someone who cared about them. The bottom line was change versus no change. almost always the way voters decide presidential elections and I am sorry to say that was the candidate. All she promised was more of the administration plus that infrastructure repair. It made sense in many ways. The country has recovered from a stupendous economic collapse under But if not a happy going to convince you by showing you graphs on the unemployment rate. I know this election is really hard for progressives to but a way to understand at least in part. A few years ago I was having lunch with who is president of the Center for Progress and liberal think tank presidents are secretly I asked her to given me a simplest explanation for why some people who never prospered over the past few years nonetheless loved President so much. She gives them I thought that was very and I think a big part of going on today as well with Trump. I like your as far as the emotions goes. As to ability to follow through see how it works out. Especially if the new first move to support the common man is deregulating the banks. I just laughed out loud about that one. But the holidays are and everybody deserves a little bit of a break from 24-7 politics. why God invented football. Obviously we share the same basic theology. be taking a conversational too. But while being thankful on be counting our talks as one of my blessings. Me Happy Thanksgiving.

Ms. White was expected to leave no matter the outcome of the election. But many Democrats had hoped that if she would choose a strong proponent of regulation to succeed Ms. whose policies often reflected a political middle ground. the agency is almost certain to be pushed to the right. Trump has vowed to dismantle the financial regulatory overhaul Congress passed in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

And the government is considering including a measure of contact hours in the Teaching Excellence Framework a that actually measured teaching excellence... Read it is not that simple. courses with some of the most satisfied students have the fewest contact hours theology and religious So when measuring how good a course should we look at contact hours at If more is not necessarily how should universities decide the right amount of contact or are massive variations in workload across subjects particularly in the mix of contact time and independent study. This is a concern for some especially those on humanities courses who have only a couple of contact hours a and compare themselves to friends studying medicine or dentistry. But difficult to make value on this basis. Not all contact hours are the same class sizes and teaching vary hugely. Research funded by the Quality Assurance Agency found that students did not want more contact time if it simply meant more large lectures. When asked what would help them select a students wanted to know if they would be taught by trained teaching staff in small settings. Focusing on measuring contact time runs the risk of obsessing about the number of rather than the quality or the importance of activities and work the findings from the Engagement Survey provide further evidence that simply allocating more classes to students might not benefit asked students to their development of academic skills such as writing and critical thinking.

I knew for only a little over 11 but his music has been part of my life from my early when I was starting to write my first was a towering figure in musical life. Premieres of his works were big events. He was a pianist and jazz musician who was outrageously skilled in each of these categories. It seemed unfair that so much talent was given to just one man. As a young and eager I was obsessed with consuming as much music as I could get my hands and I even stole a score of first symphony from my local library because I coveted it so much. I get enough of his heady mix of strict and sensuous orchestral sound. In the he was one of few that alone was enough to give him status. Then there was his translation done with his the pianist of complex theoretical book on new a bible for young composers in the when I met him in a restaurant in New just after I was very nervous. including my teacher and great friend Oliver told me get on like a house on but that made me even more apprehensive. What if we just hit it What I remember from the first moment of eye contact was that was a person I immediately felt comfortable with. I was dazzled by his amazing wit and a but here was somebody I felt always known. Maybe because I knew his music so well. Twitter get enough of his Mark on met regularly in New or over the following years. He was and remains the funniest man ever never always incisive and wise. In the first year of our friendship we emailed each other almost every day. He had this wicked way of writing that was sardonic but always kind. I would provoke him by just listing composers I knew would elicit a withering response because of what he considered their ineptitude. But when he loved a such as or he would be effusive in his praise. And if we started to talk about the conductor John you stop him admired him greatly. I saw him perform both solo and with other jazz singers. By his own he possess the most spectacular singing but his musical phrasing and the way he each interpretation of every song is something I have rarely witnessed and will never forget. almost four years after his I miss him so much his turn of phrase and his with that slight twang.

A wonderful and discussion of an immensely complex and issue. Some final forcing the hand of policy makers and developing responses to poverty are vital to elephant conflict cannot be but we can try to control how humans network of parks and wild lands is needed to allow elephants to roam out demand and the legal market in China is going to be but the government appears to be for the future is not but it is probably limited to small pockets of land An entirely I will but my This excellent panel give us measured hope for the future. 22 2016 many countries afraid it will not possible. We often forget Central and West where elephants are in many areas doomed. If we cannot stop the current elephant poaching your grandchildren will probably be able to see wild elephants only in a handful of in the Eastern and Southern tiny islands of elephants surrounded by oceans of people. 22 2016 but unless we all redouble our efforts to combat build community support for reduce reduce trafficking through market and dramatically reduce demand for the number of places with significant numbers of wild functioning as they will be very much smaller than now. But there is real 22 2016 think so because high value tourism areas will be maintained. They might be like and in in getting to them you and your kids will drive through or fly over farms and livestock grazing lands because people have eradicated the know what the word in is for pest animals with no value vermin. Current policy is in effect making wildlife vermin from the perspective of rural communities. 22 2016 I think that with increasing momentum to listen to the elephant specialists talking about the just local abundant populations in one or two we can get ivory under control and poaching significantly lessened. And I strongly believe that if we don't want simply islands of elephants but migrating we have to plan this now and in the next 5-10 years while we have something to work with. This applies in where the elephant specialist group just met last week. For all of those people who have or are going to have grandchildren the question is back to you are you with We need you to make your desire known to politicians and help us fund the work until the governments and corporations step up their funding and stewardship for elephants and their habitat. elephants are whose Elephant Family focuses on elephants paints a frightening picture of the future. 22 2016 the past 100 years of elephant populations have been wiped out. Without this iconic animal could be facing extinction within 3 which is why this species is listed as Endangered. They now number as few as 40,000 across 13 countries in with probably occurring in Habitat loss of and fragmentation of populations are causing and then the results of that such as train strikes are killing as well as hunting for ivory though not all elephants have tusks and females don't have retaliatory killing for such as by electrocution traps hooked up to the mains or setting out poison bait such as poisoned pineapples are killing what these superb wild giants have been reduced to crop especially in places where people have settled and have no history of living or knowing how to live with Stiles also thinks things are looking bleak. 22 2016 destruction and fragmentation is the obvious answer. It's remarkable how well they've done in and when you think of the population pressures. it looks like poaching for ivory is on the increase in and carvers are still churning out the and read how various states are planning what can be done. Says 22 2016 we have hope by protecting and keeping habitat areas connected and working with both rural communities and experts alike to understand more where elephants need to move and what they need to eat. We can lessen the interaction between people and elephants and help people safely. We can work with governments and companies to rationally plan where land change will occur but we need to resource that research and those experts so they are ready with the So there IS but we need to act now. as we attempt to get control globally on the battle against ivory and illegal poaching in we are learning tremendous lessons to be applied in to protect space and empower people to allow our largest land mammal still have room to roam. Our biggest project at the moment with other is our Corridors Campaign. On asks why we use funds from tourism to support local communities so they turn to just not enough to go says 22 2016 there are working examples of involving local communities in the way you it's simply a drop in the ocean. There are million and millions of poor people and just a fraction of them is actually with tourism. And you need just a few poachers and a couple of traffickers or brokers to create havoc. a huge Human Toll behind the ivory trade and poor exploited people are a big part of it. 22 2016 the same situation in Even with the number of poor people who actually benefit from it whose lives are uplifted by its effects is a very small number. Whatever the solution it has to be more though out and must benefit the poor community in money also fails to reach the communities says Hedges. 22 2016 the reason is that entrenched big businesses that are not set up to provide significant benefits to the local people in and around the areas. Corruption is sometimes a problem too. Governments need to do more to and otherwise help local initiatives and to require more equitable benefit sharing by the big operations. You are correct to say that in can generate see the paper I referenced Weaver G. C. Complementary benefits of tourism and hunting to communal conservancies in says there is an important role for development aid to play to fill these gaps. 22 2016 think community needs are greater than the support they are especially in many but the rural poor in all countries where elephants range are too often left on their own. In the places where wildlife still exists are in places where the most people live. They may not even know when there is a government compensation scheme that can help them. So I don't think elephant populations always need to for through trophy hunting or tourism income. But I think that better access to development or government aid or even an farming and access to markets can boost the morale and empowerment of communities. Those communities also do not want to be a target for criminal gangs preying on the unemployed to poach. Strong communities are a very important part of this and support so they can use techniques or understand elephant routes help prevent interaction. Stiles says this is already underway in 22 2016 is a critical question and in right now there is a group doing exactly planning protected corridors to be left open to connect protected areas and private conservancies. All range states should conduct such including corridors And Hedges agrees. 22 2016 Elephants do need large areas of habitat and even in we are now seeing habitat fragmentation and loss become a significant problem for elephant conservation. In of habitat loss has long been one of the biggest threats to which are now largely confined to protected many of which are too small for long term viability and have huge problems on their borders. Maintaining connectivity or restoring it if already lost is essential. as notes there are some encouraging examples from countries such as and but much more needs to be done in many more places. For those feeling far away and here are some concrete actions you can take today. 22 2016 agree with lobbying governments. These should be considered World Heritage Animals and as global citizens we can help strengthen that argument and get more resources put towards Forest and Wildlife Departments. Stronger departments aid better resource and not only help provide stability but can stand up for protection of habitat for the good of communities and wildlife. Preventing environmental damage of silting of polluted water which communities later. I also endorse that people worldwide support the conservation that can help direct research and aid to experts and communities for bringing about local solutions. say most panelists. Although there are some caveats. 22 2016 think the quote is the Mother of applies here. Some of the most innovative community schemes have come about when trophy hunting was not an and then other aid schemes and other government departments participated in community not just wildlife Stiles says it could work for some species. But not elephants. 22 2016 not convinced that trophy hunting is essential to conserving at least elephant maybe other species. It's a complicated from Elephant Action League 22 2016 hunting is often the of government that do not want to protect wildlife and provide local communities with real economic Hedges agrees complicated. But also perhaps an issue by both advocates and relative to its potential impact. 22 2016 I would personally never shoot an animal for its trophy there have been some successful examples of trophy hunting for some species generating revenues for and encouraging attitudes among local people. Trophy hunting has the potential to provide those benefits in difficult places where there are few other options for Trophy hunting can therefore help keep significant areas of land under wildlife land that might otherwise not be so used. But in some places trophy hunting operations have predator introduced or bred trophies all of which are bad for biodiversity conservation. it's complicated. It is also hard to see that trophy hunting is likely to ever play a significant role in elephant conservation. The amount of money generated by trophy hunting is also small relative to the funding needs for conservation in and so in some ways the heated debates are a distraction from the bigger issues. Hunter Life after global outrage into funding for conservation in Conservation Letters 296-301. has asked via email how we go about fighting the illegal trade when it is so Stiles 22 2016 the demand where consumers law enforcement in pretty much every country has proven ineffective if high demand prevails. If shops are closed traders and consumers move to websites and members only social media. Demand must be but this is a long of Elephant Family points 22 2016 the words of a wildlife enforcement illegal investigation and enforcement is still woefully inadequate in the countries that matter states and There's a need to this is a crime problem and the response needs to be police led. Customs have demonstrated they have mandate and therefore little will to investigate the hundreds of ivory seizures made to date. Many techniques still aren't being such as controlled forensic analysis of crime scenes for links to and lack of proactive responses. Sources within the trade have indicated that serious offenders are only afraid of imprisonment if actually yet such a deterrent barely Hedges of 22 2016 is correct to stress the challenges inherent in demand reduction and there needs to be a much greater focus on effecting change not just raising we have seen to little of the former in demand reduction campaigns to date. But demand for wildlife products including ivory and rhino horn has been reduced in the past in a number of so we know it can be done. Elephants are wild animals and so conflict is hard to according to the panel. Consultant Stiles says we can only control how humans respond. 22 2016 those who suffer the depredations of the only thing that has been demonstrated to prevent retaliation is if the people gain tangible benefits. Very few places have mechanisms in place for that have to involve says Wildlife 22 2016 between humans and wildlife cannot be avoided. However solutions have to come from the people living with wildlife. Innovative ideas of how to live harmoniously can't take a top down they have to build economic says Hedges in a comment too long to post so link to it here. He also suggests further investigating insurance and other ways to manage or understand the impact on humans. 22 2016 addition to trying to ensure local people derive direct financial benefits from the presence of wildlife such as elephants whenever a key part of mitigating conflict or conflict more generally is to adopt a sound approach to testing and promoting effective reduction methods. There are methods that can help reduce some circumstances at out there but they need to be deployed more effectively. Approaches such as insurance need to be further tested and developed too. Most including Hedges from agree that the mean it when they say they will phase out their legal ivory 22 2016 I think the Government is serious about shutting down the domestic market in ivory in China. That commitment was announced at the highest level in a joint communique from President Xi and President in 2015. Earlier this year the authorities said publicly that they would announce the timetable for implementing the so we can expect to see that announcement points out that there has been little movement since they made their announcement a year ago. 22 2016 this is Govt hasn't announced a even though Hong which is 2020. Can we be sure that China is serious about even after we now that officials from high office are involved in the of points out the difficulty in enforcing laws in a country as vast as China. 22 2016 the ending of the domestic legal trade in whiles it will undoubtedly help we should also be aware that it is a recurring pattern in China that good laws can be passed but that enforcement failure can lead to unexpected results. China often resists legislation for as long as then acts when the diplomatic costs become too high. But that is not the same as effective enforcement. China is a very big reach is less effective than many outsiders and enforcement may not be a priority. If you look at the overall movements in the relatively recent surge in demand from for both ivory and rhino I suspect that the bulk of both are being smuggled into China it's a change of route rather than a drop in who works with the elephant specialist believes some news might be imminent. 22 2016 heard they will announce the plan in It will involve a phased allowing ivory traders and factories to dispose of their as Hong has done Before our panel convenes at here is some reading material that could provoke thoughts and founder of Wild on the drawbacks of exclusive protected zones and outlines a different mode of can save elephants.

The 2016 presidential election took a heavy toll on the vast army of journalists assigned to cover grinding down shoe fingertips and in equal measure.

To begin poking some of those the Guardian has teamed up with the Journalism Review a leading source of media criticism. It has compiled a unique oral history of the 2016 election through the eyes of 40 of the top and press reporters and columnists who helped shape and define the public perception of this race. The narrative runs to 11,000 with the Guardian publishing an edited version of it.

It matter that some people were doing good work because just talking to ourselves and people who already agree with another theory has been aired increasingly by pundits such as of Fox News that flips the argument that the media did too little too late to expose Trump on its head.

My husband and I are in our and have been together for 30 years. I cannot remember the last time we had sex it was at least four years ago. The last few he found it difficult and lost his erection. I know and I think I felt that maybe it was me somehow. The problem is that we have no intimacy at all. He has never been terribly demonstrative and I wonder if this is because his parents never but now we never never hold never cuddle. I have but it is very obvious that he want me near him he becomes stiff and awkward until I let go. At the every conversation we have turns into an argument at it seems better not to talk at all. Hence the idea of even starting to become close again is not something I feel I want to do. I see other couples our age holding hands and being affectionate even my who are now feel lonely. Our two children will soon both be gone. I often think about leaving but the reality is very difficult to think about. We have very little pension between us and our future depends on selling up and possibly buying somewhere smaller. If I were to leave we would both struggle for and I would certainly have no option of retiring from my which I find very stressful. We live as We share we do things as a family we eat together and share etc. We spend evenings together. We go out as a couple maybe once a year. I yearn for some love and affection from someone although I could go on as I when I think of the next 30 years or so without especially when my children have I feel very down. I know what to do. I know how to begin to leave him as I have nowhere to cannot afford to rent somewhere and want to leave our lovely house. I am going round in circles month after year after year goes by. I wish I could just have a break from him in the hope that we could then and make a new start. Some couples have or sex but a lot of and function well and are happy. Some couples have a great sex life but little else. The key is what both of you are happy and you are clearly not lack of intimacy seems to bother you the which surprising. Intimacy which a specialist in relationships once described to me as absolutely what was going on with the other is really about communication and that seems to be sorely lacking. Communication is hugely important in relationships. when a man loses his the partner it and then consulted a therapist who is such a common problem and usually it is disguising other major erectile dysfunction is not something to discount easily and be medically checked out in the first instance. Has your husband been to seen a I appreciate that it is a difficult subject for you to bring up with a man loses his the partner it and then retreats. What then tends to happen is people become more distant. They communicate and every conversation turns into an what may be happening if your partner fears erectile dysfunction is that he will fear physical closeness and you in turn interpret that as rejection. And so it goes parents not being overly affectionate with each other necessarily explain why your husband is like this. His generation tended not to be so Although we note that you say your parents are very affectionate together this may throw your own relationship into starker think it is very much worth trying to because you really think about splitting up if you tried as far as possible to fix this. I think therapy would really help either try your or find an accredited local therapist through the College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists site would be most beneficial if you could go to therapy but you make your husband go. I appreciate that even asking him to go may be too much at the moment you can have couples therapy on your own and he can join you or not at all. It would be amazingly beneficial for you to talk in a safe place this problem is nothing to be ashamed you and your husband need is communication and when you do eventually sit down and it will be amazing what comes out. I always think that seeing yourself through someone eyes can be incredibly or incredibly alienating. That is the but either way it is illuminating unless you want to spend the next 30 years in this dulled it is a process you have to go through.

Who will become the next chair of the Democratic National This leadership contest has significant implications for the future of politics. The choice will help determine how the Democratic party responds to its extraordinary defeats in recent ending with the election of Trump.

For one many vested interests want the Democratic party to change. Most of the money it raises ends up in the pockets of political advertising consultants and advertisers many of whom have become rich off the current arrangement. They naturally want to keep the Democratic party apparatus is ingrown and entrenched. Like any old it only knows how to do what it has done for years. Its state and quadrennial national conventions are opportunities for insiders to meet old friends and for aspiring politicians to make contacts among the rich and powerful. Insiders and the rich going to happily relinquish their power and and hand them to outsiders and the Most who call themselves Democrats never hear from the Democratic party except when it asks for typically through mass mailings and recorded telephone calls in the months leading up to an election. The vast majority of Democrats know the name of the chair of the Democratic National Committee or of their state committee. Almost no registered Democrats have any idea how to go about electing their state Democratic chair or almost none have any influence over whom the next chair of the Democratic National Committee may be. We must rethink or will prevail Read have been a Democrat for 50 years I have even served in two Democratic administrations in including a stint in the cabinet and have run for the Democratic nomination for governor in one state yet I have never voted for the chair or of my state Democratic party.

This generated allegations in the 2016 race that the Democratic National Committee was siding with against Sanders allegations substantiated by leaks of emails from the So what we now have is a Democratic party that has been repudiated at the headed by a Democratic National Committee that has become irrelevant at run by a series of insider politicians. It has no deep or no capacity for mobilizing vast numbers of people to take any action other than donate no visibility between no ongoing activism. If it is to be relevant to the the Democratic party must be capable of organizing and mobilizing in opposition to Republican party turning millions of people into an activist army to peacefully resist what is about to happen by providing them with daily explanations of what is occurring in along with tasks that individuals and groups can do to stop or mitigate their harmful must harness the energies and idealism of young people across the nation who were drawn to campaign because of its promise to get big money out of reverse widening turn the wildly expensive and baroque complex into a reverse climate end the militarization of our police and the mass incarceration of our people and stop interminable and warfare.

Labor leaders fear that such moves would encourage many workers not to pay anything to unions representing depleting union treasuries and making unions weaker in lobbying and politics. Many Republican lawmakers are eager to weaken unions because they are major supporters and funders of the Democratic party.

Voters under the age of 30 voted for by an margin. young are far more likely to be concerned about climate change than older there is a gender though smaller than many expected. Despite accusations from 15 women that Trump or assaulted and a recording of Trump bragging about sexually assaulting he only lost the female vote by 12 points the same margin by which he won the male and approximately the same margin by which beat and among women. White women even favored Trump by 10 and white women without a college degree by an astonishing 28 points. misogyny dissuade women from voting for him. They normally favor Democratic presidential candidates by a margin of about 20 points more than men. also the margin by which women are more concerned about climate change than did elect and then important to remember that as with Gore in more voted for than her victorious opponent. Gore received about a half million more votes than W. Bush. will likely receive over a million more votes than Trump. Bush and Trump were elected because of the antiquated electoral college the popular vote was closer in 2016 than in 2012 or 2008. Republican voters were willing to forgive many disqualifying flaws. They care about his constant lies. per cent of evangelicals voted for Trump despite his long history of immoral behavior. But many voters willing to overlook the scandal of emails. And much of support was concentrated in areas like my home state of where she won by over 28 while enough rural white Trump voters were distributed across swing states to give him narrow victories and electoral college votes.

Trump promised to change but he and his policies will hurt his voters. is changing and not the fault of Democrats or but Trump made them scapegoats and made empty promises to turn back the clock.

For was the country most to blame for obstructing international efforts to curb climate change. Our senate refused to ratify the Protocol. President W Bush refused to take any action to cut US carbon pollution. Senate Republicans blocked the cap and trade legislation passed by the House of Representatives in 2009. over the past four the US has taken action and shown leadership in tackling climate change. As a humans had a slim chance of keeping global warming below the dangerous limit. Trump and congressional Republicans have vowed to reverse that progress.

It activates a primal impulse in our brains to seek out rewards. And in this regard not very different from in the the psychologist BF Skinner invented a device called the conditioning now known as the Skinner which he used to test theories on rats. Skinner wanted to see what effect different kinds of positive such as food and negative such as electric would have on the he experimented with putting the rats on a fixed schedule of reinforcement. For if the rat pressed the lever inside the it would receive a food pellet. If it continued pressing the every hundredth time the rat would receive another pellet. Skinner also experimented with a variable schedule. In this scenario the rat know when the reward was coming. It might have to press the lever 20 times to get a or it might have to press the lever 186 times to get a pellet.

Stories such as a report just days before the election that an agent investigating use of a private email server had killed himself were deliberately designed to tap into debate around the key tailors the its users see to what they and their friends have previously liked and especially partisan stories aimed at supporters of either candidate in the election could spread rapidly and in some cases earn significant amount of advertising revenue for their end of the election has not stopped the spread of false stories.

Then imagine you were a had repeated chances to ask the next president of the United States about this and decided to not do apparent failure of the media during the presidential election has been multifaceted and fiercely debated. But the absence of climate change as a leading topic in the election of Trump is perhaps the single greatest rebuke to the idea that power should be held to account for the benefit of this and future failure was most apparent during the presidential where hours of television saw not one moderator question pitched to Trump or on climate change. It was left to Ken he of the red sweater and brief to come closest with a question about coal consequences of unchecked climate which is essentially what Trump proposes by denying the problem dwarfed every other issue including emails discussed during the debates. And yet it raised. It was the equivalent of getting an exclusive interview with and in 1942 and not asking them about the change was also missing in broader coverage of the especially on cable where scientific emergencies make good fodder for breathless journalism. The public were periodically warned that the seas are eating away east coast and that no not just it really is warm this but climate change was treated as a side issue rather than being central to every energy and foreign policy question the country is grappling with. a leading climate is the great issue of our time and we are skirting around it. just baffled by To be many also skirt around climate change even if they are concerned about it.

Polling by the Pew Research Center shows half of supporters cared about climate change a great compared with of Trump supporters. Maybe now that the reality of the next four years of president Trump is sinking a more considered view of the problems faces will take hold. Maybe people will realize important that left it to the very last minute to cut greenhouse gas emissions and that failure to do this will probably risk their prosperity and national security. Maybe the spread of disease and the rising seas will be grasped as something to be urgently remedied before tropical advance further and south is inundated. There is much detail to work both on the impacts of climate change and how policies will influence them. The has promised to withdraw the US from the climate to scrap the Clean Power slash funding for renewable energy and somehow attempt to reboot the ailing coal industry. How far he will go with this and indeed how invested he personally is in it beyond outlandish tweeted is still unclear. Exiting the accord will require a notice period but as the agreement is beyond its goal of avoiding dangerous global Trump could simply drop any attempt to cut emissions and sit it out as other countries try to suppress their panic as to what to do now that the US a climate leader anymore. Trump wants to accelerate domestic coal and gas production to achieve energy but this goal is contradictory and barely feasible given the unfavorable economics facing coal and oil in particular. The new president also wants to roll back the Environmental Protection Agency while having water and clean air. He has spoken admiringly of natural beauty but has surrounded himself with fossil fuel billionaires and lobbyists who want to split open public lands for their enrichment. Republicans largely support this stance but at the same time they want a public enraged by degraded national parks or another Flint water for example.

In when the Gender Identity Development Service at Clinic it received two referrals in its first year of operation. As current director of the it was considered a option for a clinical psychologist to in the field of gender identity in young people there enough patients. That is not how it has turned out. Last 1,400 children under 18 were referred to double the number the year before. Of these nearly 300 were under the age of with some as young as three years reasons for this exponential increase are obviously complex. One factor seems to be a huge shift in awareness of individuals in wider culture. The attention paid to in and a Carter playing a role in the historic tragedy of the story told in and the many public controversies about respect for trans rights have all informed this awareness. It is never just a phase. if these kids do go through self has helped to open up a space for greater acceptance and particularly in but also for highly emotive and debate about how best to help young people who believe they need to transition. At the sharpest end of this debate are the parents whose children are identifying themselves as well before and sometimes living outwardly as the other sex. These children and their parents are more aware than ever that there are choices available to them to correct what they believe to be the error in their bodies. It can seem these choices are the ultimate but the decisions parents have to make about intervening in their biology are anything but couple of weeks ago I sat in on a conference by a charitable support group for parents of children who identify as trans. The charity has been much in the news in recent in part because it has featured in the widely reported custody battle heard at the High Court that involved a boy of seven allowed to live as a because his mother had become convinced those were his wishes. The judge in the Justice ruled that the boy should live with his and that the mother caused significant emotional harm to her son in her active determination that he should be a Mermaids had supported the mother in her belief that her son identified as for two years and described the ruling as a injustice and which had been for the another case it was reported that a family was taking legal action against a local authority for backing their adoption of a name as a step towards changing her gender. The mother of the girl said she believed her daughter was too young to make her own decision. rights of parents in the are being she those who have traditional values. It is leaving parents to feel vulnerable and Twitter aged started asking his mum questions about gender at the age of six. at S Management. Digital Art Bell S went along to the Mermaids conference in part to try to make sense of some of these issues for myself. It seems to me unquestionably a wonderful thing that young people faced with some of the trauma of these feelings about who they are can find tolerant space in which to experiment with different expressions of their gender and be protected in law from discrimination. But as a I find it hard to get rid of the feeling that the more choices you give to younger the more they are likely to adopt them for a variety of psychological reasons.

was something endearingly old school about the jailbreak that brought to mind the robber who achieved notoriety in the by escaping from three high security prisons. Those of us who have watched too many episodes of Toughest Jails have grown used to the idea of the modern prison as a fortress where inmates go to rot until they die. Not so where two prisoners managed to recreate their own version of the Redemption by sawing through their bars and escaping to the street via a series of sheets that had been knotted together. The absence went unnoticed for many hours because they had placed mannequins in their beds to make it look as if they were still asleep. Quite where the prisoners got their files and mannequins from has not yet been made public.

My family may be but I have always been a and I officially registered for the party shortly after my 18th birthday. The first Trump rally I went to was in Las last year.

Trump will be great for by bringing jobs and investing in inner cities by lowering wants to repeal to achieve a cheaper service. A more free market in will increase competition for consumers among insurance and ensure that our prices will get lower.

He has be talking about our terrible trade deals since the whereas has voted in of every one of these disastrous deals that have cost media has tried to suggest are all against but a chunk of us cast votes for him according to exit polls. Many of the comments Trump has made about such as calling them have been taken completely out of context. He has only said a certain portion of illegal immigrants coming across the southern border are committing which is surely true. Twitter In his book Crippled Trump talks about his certainty that many illegal immigrants in are but with the US in its current state we have to put first. There are more than 3 billion people in the world who live in poverty. The US help every single one of them. We have to focus on feeding the 13 million starving the single mothers who under have gone into and our veterans who have lost their cares about our wellbeing and our future.

She had supported but said she would look more into Trump. Those are the policies that have appealed to people like desire to deport illegal immigrants alarm me. It needs to be done. He wants to deport stop employers from hiring illegal immigrants by implementing an system system that allows businesses to determine the eligibility of their employees to work in and only then push those left towards a path of Throughout his campaign Trump has said many times that he loves and that are a major backbone of this represents the ability to be straightforward about life and to be passionate in everything we do. He will be great for my community by bringing jobs investing over in inner cities where a lot of minorities live by lowering and through improvements to education which is a major issue in our community. He wants to end Common Core the educational standards initiative which dictates what students must be taught and give the power back to parents and teachers to decide how children are educated.

Always quick to get to the social media came up with an instant distillation of the global response to the unsettling election of Trump as president of the United Trump to meet at the White House live updates Read declared that we had witnessed something more than a simple change of government. a slogan would not have circulated had Mitt beaten in it implied that Trump had not merely taken over the running of the United States for four but that his presidency represented a much darker threat that it in destroy the Twitter is prone to the hyperbolic and hysterical. But more sober commentators were raising a similar albeit in not quite such stark terms. the editor of the New spoke for many when he election of Trump to the presidency is nothing less than a tragedy for the a tragedy for the and a sickening event in the history of the United States and liberal democracy It is impossible to react to this moment with anything less than revulsion and profound For the millions who shared that dawn on felt like mourning in they fear is that Trump will make good on all the promises and threats he made during these last 18 months. What if he goes ahead and deports 11.3 million undocumented What if he really does ban all entering the What if he tries to use the powers of the state to go after media that have him making life difficult for the businesses that own inquisitive newspapers such as the for example as he has said he What if he overturns abortion even imposing form of on a woman who terminates a as he once And what if he really does build that Twitter How the 2016 US election night are plenty who believe that if Trump went ahead and actually implemented his he would create a different xenophobic and at odds with some of the founding principles religious equality or freedom of speech that have defined the United States since its founding. The country would still exist but it would no longer be there is a ready chorus of realists and quick to say that such talk is excessive. Those voices offer assorted forms of reassurance. they make the perennial claim that every successful politician whatever the bluster and rhetoric of the campaign always moderates once in office. This view holds it to be all but a law of nature that the radicalism of the candidate is always tempered by the reality of governing. Trump may have talked up a storm on his way to the White they but once behind the desk of the Oval practical considerations will surely constrain runs the there are formal mechanisms in place to do just that. The United after is ruled by a constitution that insists on the separation of so that the executive the president can never go too always held in check by both the independent in the form of the supreme and the Congress. These venerated institutions will surely prevent Trump from doing anything too crazy. Less but also to be taken into account is the federal a vast civil service of who will ensure that any Trump proposal is softened and smoothed into sanding off its more wild edges. And there is always the they surely let Trump get out of trouble none of those reassurances stacks up. Start with the notion that once he has sworn the oath of Trump is bound to tone it dropping his most incendiary plans. The trouble with that idea is that party bigwigs were saying the same thing throughout the earnestly hoping that Trump would change once he became the that he would change once he won the party that he would change once he started the campaign proper in Normal candidates do indeed do that. But with it never happened. Twitter Rams cheers as Trump speaks at a rally in Grand he kept sounding insulting bereaved military parents one a former Miss Universe the next. The only time he agreed to take direction was in the very final when he finally stuck to a message and read scripted lines from a teleprompter. But that was just for a few when the big shiny prize was in sight. It is a slim foundation on which to build the hope that a man with a proven lack of impulse control just grab them by the will miraculously transform himself the minute he walks through the door of 1600 if the restraint come from what about from there be institutions to hold Trump in The trouble Republicans did not only win the they also won both houses of Congress. That gives Trump enormous a strength that has eluded most of his predecessors. W Bush governed with a Republican Congress for a short spell. Before the last Republican to enjoy such might was in result is that Trump will face no congressional constraint. They will do his bidding. Some have suggested while their party affiliation might be the Trump will nevertheless encounter resistance on Capitol Hill because so many congressional Republicans are hostile to him. They cite the House who publicly clashed with Trump several times on the campaign once accusing him of making a example of a racist and who endorsed Trump only through gritted and Trump mark a Politicians must not pander to it Read will not dare oppose Trump now. Trump is the one with the national the winner of a much larger electoral college victory than anyone ever thought possible. Trump won states that had eluded the Republicans for he even took which had been in Democratic hands since 1988. That gives him huge clout inside the Republican party. He succeeded in doing what they had long failed to expanding the map and winning over white voters who had previously spurned so Republicans in Congress will be the junior partners in this new forced to bow to the man whose electoral appeal is so much stronger than theirs. He be their they will be his. If representatives were to dare to step out of Trump will ask them who the voters in their districts who will almost certainly have voted for him would back. The answer will always be pressure be applied only to Republicans. Witness this exchange between Newt to be a possible secretary of state in a Trump and journalist had asked about the proposed border wall with wondering if a Trump administration would really be able to get Congress to pay for it that no one believes ever despite hot pay for it replied that he would use the pressure of to bring doubters around. how many Democrats are up for election in the Senate in adding that the answer was 25. you really want to go home as the guy who stopped the by all but build it in if Congress promises to be what of the supreme surely the ultimate That body has a ready to be filled by the next president. Trump can nominate a pliant judge and the Senate will be unlikely to resist. That would instantly give Trump a 5-4 conservative majority on the highest court.

He can build his border wall if he wants to so memorable was the the political penalty for not doing so will be enormous. But he can do much more day he can at the stroke of a pen undo much of the legacy. Trump has had a team of aides draw up what they call the First Day a series of executive orders signed by that Trump could overturn with his signature before he has got his feet under the desk. Among the measures they have targeted for repeal the agreement on climate the refugee and the rules demanding checks on the background of someone seeking to buy a gun. By the end of that first would already be a changed work starts on the border most vociferous supporters will demand action on the other signature the deportation of those migrants. With Republican control of the House and he will have no excuses for inaction or delay. On there has been some advance work. One envisages a force of 90,000 equipped to make raids on restaurants and building rooting out illegal immigrants. As of chartered buses seats on and planes can accommodate would carry deportees to the border or to their home Others have talked of putting these unwanted people on trains and expelling them a method that evokes the darkest chapter in the Trump could work on his ban on entering the US. The constitution might strike that down as discrimination on grounds of but it would not be too hard to refashion it. Trump has spoken of banning arrivals from countries associated with which may be an effective workaround. And all the Trump would be shredding the legacy of first black abolishing which gave millions health there is another promise Trump will want to implement. It came during the debates when Trump pledged if he he would put in jail over her use of a private email server as secretary of state. He do that but he could steer his Justice Department to pursue perhaps via a special prosecutor. Who would stop him doing His base will demand nothing their cries of her are still ringing. only thing that might stay his hand is if he calculates that the threat of prosecution provides useful a sword to hang over the heads of the to ensure they keep quiet and out of his this is the country that Trump unshackled and unbound can starting three months from now. Oblivious to the hostile to snarling towards and seeking to roll back rights that took decades to secure. It would be a country that saw the constitution not as its greatest but as an obstacle to overcome. It would see diversity not as a but as a fact to be at best. And anyone objecting to any of this would find the big all three branches of arrayed against them. RIP It certainly might feel that what we saw in the astonishingly ugly campaign fought by Trump would be only an inkling of what is to follow. as one senior Democrat put it to horror show has not even started.

by the was the line that was supposed to have ended campaign for presidency. Instead it turned out to be one of the most astonishing and successful strategies for the highest office. In a campaign based on misogyny and Trump proved that boasting about sexually assaulting far from ruining a can boost and white women voted for him in droves. Grab by the indeed. The first black president will now be succeeded by a man endorsed by the according to Trump and his male and is what the dream actually looks lot will be written about how victory represents a backlash of rage from the white working classes. The election of this narrative proves how these people feel ignored by the elite politicians and metropolitan media. We need to hear more from these the argument and how they have suffered because of the demise of the opioid the death of the this not least far from being a of those who earn more than and of white college graduate voters chose Trump. But even leaving that to say that no one took notice of the angry white vote in this US election is awfully reminiscent of politicians saying one talks about when it feels like you know I think we got that base well and truly from ignoring the white working class during this they were written about so extensively by nervously placatory liberal journalists that these articles became a genre unto perfectly by Hart last week help but notice that people in are angry I wanted to hear more but Ed explained that Brooks had scheduled an interview with him to discuss whether he ate dinner with his family every and what it means for an alternative heard enough of white rage now. Oh listen to the grievances of enraged voters. But understanding them is different from indulging and the media and politicians in the US and have for too long conflated the encouraging the white victim narrative and stoking precisely the kind of campaigns that led to and Trump the voter demographics have the linking factor in Trump voters is not class but Trump wins US all on the same says live Read campaigns promised to turn the clock back to a time when white men were in the and both were fronted by privately educated false prophets such as and absurdly privileged buccaneers who style themselves as friends of the working classes while pushing policies that work against them. They have bleached language of boasting that they a negative thing as opposed to someone who has devoted their life to public and they scorn are now apparently the biggest threat to like supporters before will say that these are merely the of the sore losers the the or whatever portmanteau is conceived next. This objection always misses the obvious point that these people mourning for themselves. Whereas those who voted for Trump and did so to turn time back for their personal those who voted for remain or did so because they know time only moves and this benefits society. To try to force it back hurts call out voters for falling for such damagingly racist and sexist messages is viewed by politicians as a and dangerously snobby by the as though people are precious toddlers who must be and possibly be held responsible for any flawed thinking. There is no doubt the white working classes in the west have suffered in recent yet no other demographic that has endured similarly straitened circumstances is indulged in this way. For politicians have the black working classes who suffered far worse structural inequalities and for far longer and Trump continues to do so as only the white working classes are accorded this and insistent media empathy. No one is telling these voters to pull up their boot straps. The Dream is only considered when the white working classes who are suffering. When they are simply lazy and morally flawed. Twitter How the 2016 US election night according to the politicians and journalists who indulge inverted was seen as simply too corrupt and establishment by these voters. election is an unmistakable rejection of a political establishment and an economic system that simply working for most as though the election of a racist property billionaire who inherited his wealth was the class warrior triumph all been waiting for. But if anyone thinks it is because the media promoted false throughout this campaign to a degree never before US has elected its most dangerous leader. We all have plenty to fear Read the Times headlined its editorial about the election as if the decision between a woman who used the wrong email server and a bully in the easiest choice in the world. private email server was covered more ferociously than misogyny. That had talked at was reported as a financial flaw somehow analogous to his of tax. However much people want to blame the their voters or the result of this election is due at least as much to anyone who pushed the narrative that and Trump were equally or even similarly on them. The most qualified candidate in a generation was defeated by the least qualified of all time.
